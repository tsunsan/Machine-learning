"DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!",Negative
Beautiful and well made.,Negative
Not what I expected at all,Negative
 ,Negative
Do not waste your hard earned money it's as thick as a quarter at the base and light as a feather.,Negative
Product is NOT as described...  Save your money on this one!!  Map is severely cropped...,Negative
It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.,Negative
"Soft, true to size",Negative
"The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.",Negative
I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.,Negative
"It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.",Negative
"I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.",Negative
"The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..",Negative
"It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.",Negative
"I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again",Negative
Have allergy. There is too much bronzer. And smell disgusting (,Negative
It’s pretty but it’s small,Negative
Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.,Negative
"This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is seriously crooked.  It's very apparent and for that I'm disappointed.  Had it been flush or closer to, I'd love it.",Negative
This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.,Negative
As described but packaging could have been better for the price,Negative
"Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)",Negative
Great looking item. It came in bent- not too happy.,Negative
"This is a complete rip off!!!  Don't waste your $$ or time!  It turned within a few days of wearing it!!!!!!!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE, DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!!!!!!!!",Negative
This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be,Negative
Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.,Negative
"The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.",Negative
"The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.",Negative
"I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.",Negative
[[VIDEOID:8b03a70c569f973cb64c965e426c8895]] Whipped?  Not so much. I got a half jar of brown scented oil. But it does have a nice scent.,Negative
Not happy it was a bad purchase,Negative
Slightly blurry and it’s just a sticker over the blade couldn’t use the blade for anything. I know it’s to be collected but I still expect a knife to have a usable blade.,Negative
"I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.",Negative
I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.,Negative
Ok but smaller than we thought.  Always read the measurements!,Negative
Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.,Negative
It was just a small ceramic ornament cute but certainly not worth $25,Negative
Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.,Negative
Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.,Negative
It's kind of chunky and it bumped it falls apart but for the most part it stays together and does his job but it just looks a little ghetto and really big,Negative
Very bad made broke same day my daughter got it,Negative
"They came in so cute and after the first day, with careful hand-washing, all of the decals started peeling off of both of them. So disappointing.",Negative
It was not what I expected,Negative
I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.,Negative
"I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed ""sterling silver "" which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!",Negative
No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.,Negative
Poorly made. The clasp broke after one wearing.,Negative
"I was very disappointed to find that that this 2-pack of frames, which were both to hold 4 X 6 photos, turned out to be one for a 4 X 6 photo, and one for a 5 X 7 photo. They will not be the matched pair I had planned on.",Negative
The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again,Negative
Poor quality fabric messy writing<br />Looks like a felt pin was used<br />Plus totally gross a black hair was inside when I unfolded it,Negative
"What I got was really awful. It was not hand printed, it was computer generated, and in addition several words were misspelled. These folks took a great concept; got in a hurry and totally ruined it. So sad because it was a great idea. They probably should have charged more and done it right.",Negative
"Many of the stars where misfired they did not even look close to stars, the instruction video show a piece to install the stickers and it did not come with one.",Negative
The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.,Negative
Dislike to smallpox,Negative
I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.,Negative
"It is just a photo printed. Same thing you could do at Walmart for a few cents. The print is a nice print, but not close to being worth 13 dollars. Maybe $1.",Negative
"Will not fit average adult wrist, very small",Negative
I thought this would be something other than just a peice of photo paper - wrong! Just type this up yourself and go to Walmart to print it. It will be the same thing and cheaper.,Negative
Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.,Negative
You just as well kiss a five dollar and see if it sticks to anything. All you're doing is wasting five dollars.,Negative
Broke 2 days after outting it on.,Negative
"Have requested return over a week ago, no response from seller.  Item not quite up to par.",Negative
I thought I was buying the dish.  Turns out I could use the item so no return.,Negative
Tarnished within a week!,Negative
terrible quality & one of the birds upside down even.,Negative
picture of a picture..like our you serious? i could have screen shot the pic on my phone and printed it out myself ..get it together..false ad..you should be embarassed!,Negative
They bend to easily and mess up design.,Negative
This is not at all what I believed it to be.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning,Negative
This is not what the picture is. I’m upset it’s a rooster. And it’s not easy to stamp the egg. I would have been fine with it not stamping correctly it’s for my daughter but I didn’t want to stamp out eggs with a rooster when in the pictures it’s a hen.,Negative
"Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.",Negative
It was just a few prints. Nothing special. I guess you get what you pay for.,Negative
It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint,Negative
Will tarnish. Not worth the money.,Negative
"""not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.",Negative
"Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.",Negative
Unfortunately I am not very satisfied with my necklace that my husband got me for Mother’s Day as cute as it is it’s very delicate and it broke and I’ve only had it for like five weeks so I would highly recommend NOT buying this necklace!,Negative
I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.,Negative
"Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.",Negative
Smells nothing like a pipe or even what's in the description.  They smell like Werther's caramel.  Very disappointed.,Negative
"Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.",Negative
Not Kawaii- knock off; tiny container.,Negative
it was so so thin narrow ring.,Negative
"They were thin and danity, which is what i wanted.. but if you plan on taking them on and off every day, good luck! They are very thin, extremely hard to latch and they bend and distort very easily. I could make these at home with some wire for less then what i paid for these. Save your money!!",Negative
Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!,Negative
first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !,Negative
"Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.",Negative
Just cut<br />The crap<br />This is<br />All dirt,Negative
"They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.",Negative
"Was great until I was exfoliating in the shower. Long story short, it broke after 2 weeks",Negative
Letters are super small and light weight. A complete waste of $60! Does not look anything like the advertisement. Very dissatisfied and seller will not let me return!,Negative
Dangling stone fell off first time wearing,Negative
Finish wore off in less than a month.<br /><br />Got what what I paid for......and apparently I paid for garbage.,Negative
"Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.",Negative
"Very frail, broke easily. Should be sold for less.",Negative
"This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.",Negative
The quality of the chain is fine but the arrow itself looks like it was already used and seemed oxidized. You can even see it that they both are different colors. Maybe I’ve got a copy that was returned before. I don’t know but I was disappointed,Negative
Leaves a sticky feel on my hair and has a weird smell that's unplesant.,Negative
"It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.",Negative
Not worth buying,Negative
Cheap quality. The bracelet didn’t even last me two months.,Negative
"I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them. I've worn backless shoes many times, & could easily keep them on. These do not stay on my feet! Sad thing is, they are non returnable!!! What a rip off! Guess I learned my lesson!",Negative
After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!,Negative
"This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.",Negative
Lightweight earring but they keep twisting backwards and getting caught or twisted within the post,Negative
I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to… And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.,Negative
It is too fragile easy to break,Negative
"Lo compre en octubre para regalo de Navidad de mi esposo y para sorpresa extremadamente pequeño y nada que ver para el precio, pobre calidad, el vendedor nada que te ayuda simplemente aun diciendole que esta nuevo en su cajita no acepta la devolucion por estar pasado de tiempo. Nada profesional al menos podia ayudar al cliente aunque hiciera un descuento. NO RECOMIENDO HACERLE COMPRAS A ESTE VENDEDOR. 👎👎👎",Negative
"In fairness, the small print does disclose that a frame is not included.  But the picture clearly displays a frame.  $16.00 for a sheet of rag paper.",Negative
Not worth it. It’s basically printed paper. I don’t know how tf I’m supposed to stick it up the wall. Should definitely come with a glue to peel off.,Negative
"It has a bad smelling undertone that makes the whole house stink. It does initially smell like lemons, but after a few minutes smells really bad (waxy/rotten fruit/sour).",Negative
That was the worst piece of jewelry I've ever bought. Costume jewelry lasted longer than this earring. Turned my ear green n black around the pierced area. The so-called m sterling metal started crumble peeling off with some time type of crushing around the ball.... Waste of money. Quality mi rassss,Negative
Disappointed!! It is the perfect size and would be a great addition except it smells. Have tried a few things and still can't get it to not stink like mold!,Negative
"if you are ordering this for a small child, this would be great.",Negative
"Pretty brownish, looks like dirt.",Negative
Very small and bendable,Negative
Can’t really smell anything,Negative
What you see here is NOT what you get. It's more of a necklace pendant rather than a dog/cat tag. And i say necklace beacise they literally sent me a necklace. I only will not be returning this beacuse it does have my info on the tag so it will suffice so that my cat can roam. But really they advertise this product the worng way.,Negative
Not what I was expecting. This was literally a copied 8x10 print.,Negative
Received broken sent back,Negative
Nice print but when I saw ad on line it looked like a print stretched on a box frame but it was a flat 8 by 10 print.,Negative
These earrings were super cute and I was very excited to wear them.  They fit perfectly and looked amazing.  The only problem is that after wearing them for not even 24 hours the bar broke off from the stem.  They are super cute earrings and I wish I could’ve gotten more time to wear them before their early demise.,Negative
Pretty but too heavy for me,Negative
The picture of the stackable rings is very misleading. The rope ring is great but the solid one is a very cheap thin piece of copper wire. Would never purchase from this vendor again.,Negative
"Horrible , literally 2 days after I purchased this bracelet for my 3 months old baby , his wrist was green and the bracelet was brown. Horrible product , do not get it !",Negative
"The chain is really cheap, so it broke the second day I wore it . I lost one of the jewels when it broke. Disappointed.",Negative
Too strong  I couldn't stand it,Negative
[[VIDEOID:e50a3a286858da45b9e51d30be27c542]] I didn’t know obsidian stone turns clear after exposure to multiple showers and dish washing what a versatile stone!!!  🙄🙄🙄,Negative
"The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!",Negative
Have to cut each one and they unravel rapidly.,Negative
Unfortunately this bracelet broke. I was so disappointed. The packaging was beautiful and I thought I purchased a good solid product BUT to my disappointment the strings didn’t hold the beads. Poor quality,Negative
18mm is 0.70 inches in length.  At $20+ you should be getting 2 handfuls of raw moonstone considering you can get a 2 inch moonstone for around $1.50 at your local Mast General Store.  Do your research folks.  Don't let someone on the internet aping off the current fad of faux spiritualists rip you off.,Negative
I was very disappointed I'm this item. It was small and unframed. It was basically a small picture that looked like it had been printed out. Not as described,Negative
Not what I thought,Negative
"I ordered a size large in women’s for my daughter who likes things oversize. The shirt is tiny. Unfortunately they do not offer returns or exchanges so I’m stuck with a shirt that would probably fit a five-year-old. I do not recommend buying from the shop, especially due to their return policy.",Negative
Not big at all said not fit across the front of car like pictured it is a few inches long is all very small.,Negative
"Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.",Negative
it’s not a real crystal,Negative
"We thought the product was made very cheaply, especially considering the price. The product also came damaged.",Negative
Tarnished on me very quickly.  I thought it was stainless steel but doesn’t seem to be. Cute while it lasted though. Wore for about a month.,Negative
"I have other decor that's actually printed on old dictionary paper, this is just a photo copy (for the same price I paid for real dictionary paper). Returned.",Negative
Mine came with a bend in the corner and the photo stock paper had an aged look to it. It's ok - not wowed by it.,Negative
The engraving was sloppy,Negative
Cup had a scratch on it! Sorta noticeable.,Negative
"looks nice, but broke after two weeks of use.<br />Metal is not strong and the stones cracked",Negative
This came as a piece of cheap paper. Don’t buy it!,Negative
"The handwriting matches perfectly, HOWEVER.  I have only worn the bracket 2x and it is already changing colors. You can see it on the v and e.",Negative
Does not look like it layvasbthenoucture shows,Negative
These are very cute but not sturdy at all. Mine were broken when I received them.,Negative
The T shirt is fine but I found something I like better and this is ineligible for returns. The description was very misleading and now I’m out $25.,Negative
"Came late, bent up and parts unglued",Negative
"I followed all the instructions for putting this up. I was super excited to put this up in my toddlers room. When it was time to peel the rest of the paper off (the sticker had been up on the wall), it peeled all the letters off with it. I tried several different ways and it ended up ripping the lettering. Had to throw it in the trash.",Negative
They would not stick at all to a plastic mailbox. Had to throw them away.,Negative
One of the white stone was missing when I received the ring. Poorly made. Seller never contacted. Won't suggest this product.,Negative
I expected so much more.  I gave them with an apology.,Negative
Terrible quality fell apart before even putting up. Didn’t even come with enough screws to put together and thrown in a makeshift box! I should have flushed my $$ down the toilet. Screws it came with were too small to go through the product and into a wall and the ore made hole with the screws given went right threw the shelf breaking it before it could be assembled and used. I’d rate no stars if it let me.,Negative
Not genuine sterling silver or hypoallergenic.  The earrings are very flexible like plastic and irritate my earlobes.,Negative
This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.,Negative
Disappointed,Negative
Much smaller than expected. Pretty though. You can make these yourself. Not difficult to do. But for the price they are nice.,Negative
"The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.",Negative
Not as expected - does not look hand crafted - very disappointed,Negative
"They are not beaded.. they are plain earrings. They are nice, but not what I bought.",Negative
Very smaller then what was showing does not stick like it should’ve over charge for what it was worth,Negative
The poster was way to big. I clicked on the wrong size. Wanted to return it but have yet to receive a return shipping label. Everytime I try to click claim it says error. So now I’m stuck with a poster I don’t need.,Negative
"I only received one of the two I ordered, shipping took a very long time, and the one I received seemed smaller and cheaper than it looked online.",Negative
The words came off within 3 days,Negative
There is a smear of something on the color wrap of both pilsner coolers. It’s noticeable so I don’t know why it was shipped. I spent close to $80 on 2 Pilsner coolers. I would have expected better quality. I should have returned them.,Negative
"Came destroyed, probably not the maker but still very disappointed",Negative
I could have printed this off of my own printer. Not worth the money.,Negative
"Miniature sized, like a toy.",Negative
"On the bottom stud you see the prong is not covering a big part of the stone, yes it is also loose.  I can and have been approved for return but I have to pay shipping for a unusable product, not cool.",Negative
Mother’s Day gift that looked beautiful. But unfortunately quality was not poor. I returned the earrings much to my mother’s disappointment after the clasp broke off just as she was putting them on for the first time.,Negative
"This item is of poor quality and is so much smallest than depicted on the site. On top of that you have to pay to return the item. If I knew that i would have never purchased the item. Additionally, the item is not worth the price. Amazon should not allow venders like this on the site as they diminish your brand.",Negative
"The description is misleading.  It's just a poster, no foam backing. The pics should show such.",Negative
"A friend bought these for me for my recent birthday. The image was originally three bears. After rcpt, the image shows four, but the description still says three pieces. The seller refused to ship the missing pic (blue). So, now I have an incomplete set.",Negative
Way overpriced! Not recommended at all for this price. Should be around six dollars max!,Negative
It tarnished and turned my neck green.,Negative
It is not worth the money,Negative
"Turned my finger black after 2 days, not good quality, do not buy",Negative
Not what expected.,Negative
Had I seen this at a craft show I would never expect it to be at the most 30.00. This is a major rip off. My board as unstained places which in no way is the grain of the wood. It is a board with 2 pieces of wood nailed on each end with 2 cheap handles. No idea how the initial and decoration was added. But it had no depth and appears willl easily fade with cleaning. I was planning even at the high price to give my family members each one for Christmas. Not now. Maybe my board is defective and if the seller sees and reads this and is willing to make me one that does not look like it was made by 5 year old then my mind could be changed. But for now I can only say do not waste your money. It is a high price rip off,Negative
plastic trash nothing like whats shown for discription,Negative
"Not a picture of the Patent.  This is misleading. Across the top, there is the words “Mickey mouse patent” in large letters, but what is behind it is just a dictionary page image of where the word “Patent” would fall.  It’s dumb. I’m disappointed and they have somehow hidden all of their reviews that aren’t 5 stars.",Negative
Do yourself the favor of making your own for about ten dollars worth of dollar store supplies . This price is a joke.,Negative
I wasn't happy with the product,Negative
"2nd day of wearing,this bracelet broke loose of the fastener",Negative
I ordered this product and the one piece I got is beautiful. Unfortunately I am missing three more pieces. I am going to try to reach out to the company to get my other three pieces.,Negative
It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good for the price.. I was going to gift it to my mom for her birthday but changed my mind because of the fakeness of the plastic looking stone .. I just put it away.. 👎,Negative
Very cheap looks like a kids necklace,Negative
Pretty design not worth the price.,Negative
Defective - One stone had large brownish blemish - Returned and NO REFUND - They lost the returned item !,Negative
"This is the 7th ring I purchased from this seller and I absolutely love her work.  It’s the color of this ring, it just looks cheap.  I was sad to leave this review cause I truly love every other ring I bought, but I have to give an honest review.",Negative
"I really did love the earrings, unfortunately, I lost one the 2 nd day I wore them. The back had come loose earlier that day, but I felt it. The next time, I didn’t even know until someone said it was missing. So bummed.",Negative
Don't buy,Negative
This was very poor quality. I have never ordered something online and been so disappointed now the seller won’t respond to return item,Negative
"Made incredibly cheaply for $12 earrings. Didn't even get them out of the box before 1 broke & 2nd one broke before I could even clasp it. Also, colors are not what the pics show. An all around disappointment.",Negative
I bought these earnings for my husband.  They looked very nice but didn’t last long they ended up breaking in a month. The stone fell out and the pin that goes in your ear fell right through where the stone goes. Not made well. Sad cause they are not that cheap of a price to not last longer than a month. I wouldn’t buy them again sadly. Don’t recommend.,Negative
Impossible to put on,Negative
I bought this for my kid for school to help her stay focused. It still worked iyt for her but only lasted 2 days when it broke off.,Negative
It was used. There was blood or something similar on the earing and it was already bent. Really disgusting!! 🤮,Negative
"Make sure you read the description well. Much, much smaller than I realized.",Negative
"I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip. Never got a chance to actually wear them but hoping to replace the post with a plastic rod, if I can find the right size.",Negative
They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.,Negative
"I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...?? I'm disappointed in the price for the quality that was received, as I do not believe it is real silver .....",Negative
This is the poorest quality moonstone I have seen in a long time plus the black flaws are very ugly,Negative
"The scent lasts through several uses, but the scent is more like a soap than Eucalyptus/Mint. I don't smell either.",Negative
Had a large stain on the front of towel.,Negative
"I was very disappointed when I received these items, you could barely see the image of Muhammad Ali! I would advise everyone to keep thei money!<br /><br />These items weren't terribly expensive, but money best spent on other memorabilia!",Negative
"The earrings were not the same as the ones pictured- very disappointing. Also, the wire that goes through the earlobe was too thick and hurt my ears. I do not recommend.",Negative
Liked it until I got an infection from it. Disappointed in it.,Negative
These are cool but very cheaply made for the price I paid for them. Obviously they are just a pressed imprint which is still pretty cool however I got my set with only two different prints. I got 4 all the same and then 1 single. Also i chose to out mod podge ocer these so that the wood woulsnt stain so much. Cool set but really not worth what I paid .,Negative
"Earring looks pretty. You open up to put in your ear and it’s jagged, not cut smooth etc. No matter how cheap this is, it’s not worth it. Steer clear!",Negative
After 2 weeks sticker is coming off.,Negative
Was not as advertised disappointing!!,Negative
My husband bought me this and I tried to put it on and it t broke immediately!!!! Piece of junk. Doesn’t even deserve a star,Negative
I've emailed this retailer twice with questions and no response.  My daughters name decal wasn't as great as I was hoping for so I emailed asking questions about the first letter not looking like a capital letter.  No response and the size is n what I paid for.<br />Horrible customser service!,Negative
Ordered shirts for a girls weekends. They were late! So I requested a refund and she decline it ! Due to health and personal problems!!!! Shirts were see through and weren’t even close to the colors online. Would not recommend,Negative
These are 4 printed pictures on photo paper. Nothing special and you will have to finde frames for them,Negative
The product picture is much more crisp that what I received.,Negative
I was very excited to see this music box however I had no idea it was so tiny!  Cute trinket though,Negative
Dont buy or make fool of yourself,Negative
Very small,Negative
"The idea is great, the Mail Carrier like it EXCEPT whn exposed to a couple of days of rain, it begins to rust and after a few more days, it is unreadable and ugly!  Should be waterproofed since is purpose is to be outside. Duh!",Negative
Love the necklace however clasp brokensecond time wore it. I am very careful and small.  It didn’t last.  If it had lasted would have rated higher. Love the look of necklace but doesn’t do any goidnif I cannot wear it,Negative
One of the products blew up in the packaging and was all over everything,Negative
"The idea is fantastic but……. The ring stands too tall, *way* too tall, and the prongs on the underside stone cut into my finger and actually made me bleed.  It really is beautiful and I love the idea but the design simply doesn’t work.  I can’t even recommend it for costume jewelry because it stands so tall.",Negative
"Tiny,  thin,  wish I didn't buy.",Negative
Not even close to the description!!! There are no double strands. I got a dinky bracelet that is not even the same style as the one pictured!!!,Negative
Won’t stay in the ear,Negative
"The vibrant colors which appear in the product photo are not present in the bracelet. My simple advice is ""save your money"" for a crafts fair or make one yourself. It looks cheap, feels cheap, and IS cheap...and I am just not that picky,",Negative
"There is no way to adjust to bracelet, it just falls off my wrist. If it fit it would be cute, but I have to return it.",Negative
I’m not allergic to gold this was obviously not actual gold!,Negative
Needed item on day they say be delivered comes in 3 days later and have no use for the item and refuse to take the return plus item not as describe beware,Negative
It’s like a piece of cardboard with a computer print out ...,Negative
"These were meant to look vintage, and looked really good in the photos on Amazon. These are printed on glossy photo paper. Not at all what the description stated as ""Vintage"". If they were not for a Bosses day gift, and I had more time, I would have returned them.",Negative
Definitely not of good quality. Not as expected.,Negative
Repackaged<br />Super disappointed,Negative
I expected the print and the paper that the signage was printed on to be of better quality.  I will have to mount it on card stock and then frame it.  I was a little disappointed.,Negative
"At first loved this, then had a severe allergic reaction. I started to use this at night to sooth my dry hands cuticles . I loved the scent and very relaxing for nighttime.  Then I thought to put it in my neck and chest so I could inhale the relaxing scent , oops! My throat  began to swell I immediately washed it off took Benadryl, I also broke out in hives . Wasn’t for me not sure what ingredient caused the reaction, if you have allergies  be careful",Negative
Very disappointed in this product inscription was a very faded black as well as the colors in the flowers.  Not at all like the example.<br />Definitely not worth the price.,Negative
"Not color as pictured! Should be light blue! It’s more like a wierd denim color, not attractive!",Negative
"Yes it's comfortable and lightweight, but I am disappointed. The beads were glued off centered so it did not look cute at all because it wasn't centered.<br /><br />Shame. :(",Negative
Broke the first few days I’m very disappointed. It hangs by a needle. It’s pretty but for spending $28 on a necklace that hangs by a needle that breaks in a few days really upsets me.,Negative
For the price it's ok but the labradorite has zero flash so I'm a little disappointed in these earrings.,Negative
Does not transfer completely and they refuse to give a refund so your stuck with it. I got the large decal so that was money down the drain,Negative
Huge and heavy!!!! Chain and necklace looks cheap.  Was mislead by reviews,Negative
Lincoln never wrote or said these words. The makers of this product should do a little fact checking before they propagate misinformation.,Negative
"You can not use this as a chocolate mold. Entirely to shallow, total waste of money.  Honestly I’m not sure what you could do with this.",Negative
I was disappointed in how dull the black was on the shirt. It looks faded and like it’s been through the wash multiple times already.,Negative
We had a hard time keeping the air inside. It would deflate easily...,Negative
"Product was delivered with bottle cap completely open. Not sure if product is safe to use. Fortunately it is winter, if this was delivered in Warm weather I would have ended with a huge mess on my hand ( literally).",Negative
Very disappointed. In the picture the diamonds look bigger than they actually are. I returned the item and promptly received my full refund.,Negative
"Don’t waste your time. Cheap and flimsy, should have listened to the reviews. I could have done this myself!",Negative
Poor quality and is tiny,Negative
"This jewelry is trash. Super flimsy and bendable. It does not come with instructions, just says to watch a video but does not give a link or anything.",Negative
Bad quality stamp & shirt,Negative
Very small and dog is not pronounced.,Negative
For the price its a pure rip off !!! It is literally like an 8x10 printed picture on photo paper. Horrible. 0 stars,Negative
These do not have a pleasant scent to them.,Negative
"After about a week of wearing this, it turned my nose piercing green.",Negative
"I love the size and shape of this bag, but the smell hasn’t gone away after 2 months of having it. I even kept it out in my garage to try and air it out and it didn’t help. I love the bag, but can’t use it due to the smell.",Negative
This item was not stamped 14k and is most definitely not gold. Turned green day 3.,Negative
"Was so excited by examples showing NYC and Paris- very obvious what they were. My Disney ornament looks NOTHING like Disney! All the details are UNDER the personalization, so disappointed! Wanted something special for daughter and fiancé, this is NOT it!",Negative
This is the second item I had tried to purchase that advertises that it is sterling silver it turned my real sterling silver chain black and my whole chest gray I returned it,Negative
The picture makes these earrings seem much bigger than they are. The size was hard to find in the description. These would be okay for a small child.,Negative
"This product is literally garbage.  It looks like someone scoured old construction sites until they found a piece of water warped plywood that they could use to make this sign.  It's less than 1/4 inch thick, has no attachments for hanging it, but it wont hang anyway because it's so warped.  Waste of money.",Negative
This is a very small poster. The size of letter size paper 8x10,Negative
As you can see this is nothing like the beautiful rough stone in the picture.,Negative
Smaller than appears in the pictures,Negative
Embarrassed to give this bracelet to my girlfriend. SO CHEAP. The pics made it look high quality metal. Looks like foil or plastic that was spray painted with chrome spray paint.,Negative
"It was cheap looking, no detailing and wording was thinly stamped on. Towel was not squared up and hemming was ragged!",Negative
"I personalized these, keeping in mind the limited number of letters that are allowed in the edit. I did not get what I asked for. Seller did not communicate or contact me that my order could not be made even though I did not go over the letter count.  The seller should just ask for a name and age and not give false hope with false customization claims. These also appear glossy online but are just black and yellow ink on a dull matte finish.",Negative
It was 4 times bigger than the product specifications said. I was told it would be 8.5x11 and it came 18x24. I ordered a frame for it and now I can't use it because the frame is too small.,Negative
"The shirt was in my personal list and was waiting till november when my grand daughter will be born and the name will be announced. Somehow it got purchased, the day it arrived I requested a refund (to save this item to a list you have to go through the personalizing and then save it to the list) I planned to buy it in NOVEMBER once i know the babys name but they sent it to me and it has my moms name on it. The lettering is really close and GIANT BLOCK letters. So not happy with the lettering either. just disappointed that they wont fix their wrong",Negative
My necklace turned within a week with just daily wear.,Negative
Too small,Negative
I was really hoping for more of a gold speckle look on the earrings. The gold is dull. They are definitely overpriced. I am probably going to flick gold nail polish on them to give them some life.,Negative
Just pictures I could have had them developed myself,Negative
Se rompieron muy rapido,Negative
Not Sterling Slver!<br />Turns green and tarnished.,Negative
Very little fragrance if any,Negative
"I had ordered previously from another company with great success and ease of application.  The decal was beautiful.  However, this label would not peel off no matter what I tried. Very dissatisfied!",Negative
"The decal looked as advertised, however, after a handful of washes, it fell off. I followed the directions, there were no air bubbles, but it started pealing after a couple weeks. I do not recommend this item.",Negative
Drive safely.,Negative
I purchased this as a memorial gift for a friend. Unfortunately you could barley see the name engraved.,Negative
Had to reach out to seller because product was running late. When it finally arrived it was very poor quality. Unfinished wood that looks so poorly put together.,Negative
The smell is good but you only smell when  your next to it.,Negative
"Bought for my gf in Sept 17'<br /><br />Giving this one star since the clasp ended up breaking, and the entire chain otherwise has loosened up and become unrepairable.",Negative
Was very excited to receive this clock as a gift......it only lasted three months. This was not a cheap item and I am now trying to get info to get a repair...any info I could get would be greatly appreciated.,Negative
Cheap !!!,Negative
Looked cheap- had to decorate it to give as a gift - way too expensive,Negative
"It only came with one bottle picture shows 3. They charge you for shipping, The one bottle is $12 it is not even worth sending back and spending more money. Very disappointed.",Negative
"Too small for my son who doesn't have a large neck; it was for his birthday. I gave it 2 stars because I really like it, but it's small for a man or a woman. During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.",Negative
"Followed directions completely, but would not adhere to a plastic mailbox.",Negative
"The product is really nice, the problem is how do you play Yahtzee with one dice???  Thought was getting dices to be able to play a game, can't even roll snake eyes since there is only one dice.  :(",Negative
Cheap and easy broke. Will be return,Negative
"The design of this needle minder is very cute. However, the magnet is so weak! It barely keeps a needle on and doesn't attract my scissors and keep them on like my other minders do. Disappointed.",Negative
They do not stick fully. They are now peeling from the wall. I guess i cant return because they ate half stuck so ill have to make believe its a 3d effect of the flowers and leafs curling,Negative
"This is good for those who don't mind the extra work, but I made the mistake of impulse purchasing, without reading and unfortunately I am stuck with a kit I have to file, sand and assemble, which is not something I'm good at and not comfortable doing. Hopefully I won't mess it up. Lesson learned! Just thought I'd share from experience.",Negative
"I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..",Negative
It was of poor quality. Nerf yo not sell it to anyone.,Negative
Bad,Negative
SMALL BUT DURABLE. HOWEVER  THE NAME ON THE BAG WAS SPELLED INCORRECTLY 😡,Negative
"Very thin braids, are darkish brown in color and have literally no scent to them. Kinda ratty. I prefer braids to be fragrant, fresh and braided a bit thicker with more than a few strands of grass. These ones are very brittle and fragile. If I were to grasp them in my hand they would probably turn to dust.",Negative
This is most definitely not surgical grade metal. The color wore off by day 4 and now my nose piercing which I’ve had for years is painful and irritated. Better off paying more and getting something legit. I wanted a small diameter hoop and this is a smaller gauge than a nose ring should be and is the standard ring size.,Negative
Costume jewelry.. don’t buy,Negative
Picture came with a big wrinkle in it but the quality picture is nice.,Negative
It is nothing like they show. Is like 5 times smaller than shown..,Negative
I loved the sweatshirt and so did my friend - so comfy and cute. But she gets married in 2022 and the sweatshirt says 2023. They wouldn’t return or exchange the sweatshirt for the correct one and I couldn’t find proof anywhere that I put 2023. I ordered ANOTHER one for 2022 and still received a 2023 shirt. Sad because I was really looking forward to this sweatshirt.,Negative
I have tried to reach out to seller through this site and have not heard back.  Beautiful necklace ($53) but one stone is not correct.  Purchased for Mothers Day was hoping for a solution before.,Negative
This was not what I expected.  It was just an 8x10 photo.,Negative
The idea is great BUT when you leave on the mail box for a pick up and it rains ..... it rusts and is eventually<br />unreadable. It only took two rains to start the rusting.<br />Good idea but should have been tested first!,Negative
I was very disappointed in this product. You should not even sale this item on Amazon.,Negative
"It was tarnished the second day wearing it! Really, not sterling silver at all!!!! So disappointed!!!",Negative
My cat did not care in the least when we opened it for him. He hasn't even given it a 2nd look.,Negative
"The customization isn't right, hat is shaped weird, and the patch isn’t centered. Beware: cannot be returned either. Would give it a 0 if possible!",Negative
The images on the stones are poor quality - they're just stickers or decals.,Negative
"the quality of the opal chips is not great, sorry folks",Negative
"The two pieces are beautiful. They are photo paper,put in an envelope without any protection. After receving it there were a lot of wrinkles on it,and I could't hang it anymore. I don't undertand why it is not protected when it is shipped. Disappointed. Return.",Negative
"I was expecting a sweet scent like fruits and instead I got a floral scent, which is one of my worst scents ever. Waay to strong for me",Negative
"The engraving was not legible. An ambulance technician would not have been able to read the writing nor see it was a medical bracelet. The size of the bracelet and quality was what I wanted. Unfortunately, I had to get a refund.",Negative
This bracelet was not gold more of a rose gold. It’s not a bracelet for Adults more for infants. My son brought this for Mother’s Day for me and he was so disappointed when he opened it.,Negative
It was too small very expensive for one tiny string of beads!,Negative
Doesn’t smell like bergamot,Negative
"Didn't read the fine print... Didn't come framed... Super bummed, looks too tacky to give as a gift without a frame and I didn't want to make two purchases",Negative
Was not what I expected,Negative
This was nothing more than a computer print. Nowhere near what it shows in photo. Returned immediately.,Negative
Not the correct poster. Just plain writing.,Negative
It is very beautiful but misleading when it says 14k gold and then you have to search to find out it is actually 14k gold covered.,Negative
"Cute, but not worth the price. Material is not a good quality. If your skin is dry the material sticks to your fingers.",Negative
It’s more like a RUST colour. It looks terrible.!! I don’t know how to get it to turn silver. It arrived with a rust looking colour to it.,Negative
So cute but plot this out on the wall before you buy.  My mistake but can't return.  Looks like a post-it note where I wanted it.,Negative
Buyer beware!!  Shirt was a little small but came in the wrong style. Very confusing ordering it. Wanted glitter came in silver and they will not return. Said it was my mistake,Negative
To Small for it's price and not silver.,Negative
"This is very small, very cheap feel, and I was sent the wrong color.  The one I received was A silver color, not the gold tones. I still have some time and may return it. Here is a photo Neat a car key to capture the size.  Shoot, it’s so small I could put plot on a necklace...",Negative
They break easily and they are pretty small for a man wrist.,Negative
Heavy silver bracelet clasp broke after wearing 4 times.,Negative

I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.,Negative
The item looks cool but the sound isn’t even scary. It sounds like a loud whisper with a slight screech. A co-worker told me he thought his truck had a punctured tire.,Negative
Doesn’t work,Negative
"So I guess I should have assumed this was going to be a quick fix until I find another one to replace it, but oh well. This is a small “gold” hoop that will need to be “twisted” to open and again to secure it to your piercing. I’m not a huge fan since it will not ever fully seal closed. The material is very thin (20 gauge) but because it is so small it’s a bit sharp feeling if it gets slightly tugged by my hair.",Negative
It tarnished so fast.,Negative
"the kind of money they charge it should not rust after a short time ,it look's great very stylish my dog loves it ,poor workmanship it will rust i have had it for about 7 month's and it started rusting after 3 month's i was to say the least extremely disappointed after paying $150.00, would not recommend this product to any one",Negative
Value for your money,Negative
Mail box flag didn’t include a mounting bracket & made the installation difficult.,Negative
"I wanted to like this poster, as I've had it hanging up in my room for several months now, but I just realized that it has the words ""masturbated"" and ""masturbation"" displayed prominently behind the boston terrier, and I am mortified! The return window has already passed, but was this some kind of sick joke? I am so upset!",Negative
After not even 2 hrs of wearing it my finger was green. I’m very upset. I was really excited to wear it.,Negative
Was greatly disappointed that the initial was extremely small.  I would not recommend this product.  My previous one I purchased locally was the full length of the mask.,Negative
Thought it wouldn’t turn but it did in a short period of time.,Negative
This products red color was not received as advertised. Therefore making it useless for my purpose and unable to use.  The brim of the hat was distorted.  The box was small in comparison to hat size and arrived later than indicated.  For the poor quality of product the hat was over priced.  Sending back and would not order again.,Negative
Got one as a gift. Wore it one time and it came off because the velcro wasn't enough to keep it attached. Now I have to buy a new Fitbit because I lost it when it fell off,Negative
I used there's for first and second lobe piercings and just putting them in was quite difficult considering the small size and bending them to put them in felt like they were going to snap.<br /> I had them in for about 2 days and they were extremely irritated and swollen by that point and very difficult to take out.<br />I have skin allergies but considering they're stainless steel this should not have happened. If you do not have sensitive skin or smaller lobes then this may work better for you but I would not reccomend.,Negative
My mother love this with all of her grandkids on it. She doesn’t wear it often though as it tarnished very fast.,Negative
"The image is blurry, and it only secures with one screw causing it to hang off slightly.",Negative
"Item was much smaller than described. The ""diamonds"" were actually nonexistant. It was THAT small!<br />I tried to return it and the seller accepted my request. What wasn't mentioned was that the return shipping fee was $50!  Definitely NOT worth the price paid!",Negative
"So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.",Negative
It’s crap,Negative
Looks like the ones advertised are the best ones. The ones I got are very light. I doubt this is silver. More like aluminum with a silver stamp. Save your money. Even the gold “vermeil” is questionable. It fades after five wears or one if you use soap. It fades. Not with the money for this clown jewelry. Totally fake looking in real life.,Negative
Muy frágiles,Negative
"Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.",Negative
The bottom half wasn't covered that well in the red glitter so it's very patchy under the resin.,Negative
These are not spheres. Every picture is made to make them look like Christmas ball ornaments. They are NOT.  They are round like a tennis ball from the front and back but almost flat.<br /><br />One star for being full of garbage. Every single picture - not one shows from the side. So no one thinks they have an actual side. Dirty.,Negative
"The ends of this nose ring are very sharp, and it cuts your nose. They are not finished and you can’t get it in your nose without cutting your nose when you try to put it in. Would not recommend.",Negative
This comes with no frames and is literally printed words on card stock. I was expecting more.,Negative
Not able to give a gift,Negative
"For the money I thought it was kind of cheap looking, like something you would buy at Walmart. I expected a heavy duty frame instead of cheap plastic . Loved the print though",Negative
Product print is full looks cheap not glitter on image as shown in sample,Negative
Picture implies that the print is a cut out but when I received the item it was printed on a piece of paper. Not worth the money.,Negative
Very rough.  I used it on my face and took me two days to rehydrate.  Not what I expected.,Negative
Cute bit cracked when received but I liked it so much I had  to glue the piece of wood and staple coming out.,Negative
"Cheap, easily bendable, hard to put in and remove. Not worth the price.",Negative
It looks like your only paying for 1 to 4 real Lapis Lazuli gemstones and the rest are fake or not what was advertised!,Negative
it was too small,Negative
"This was the most disappointing bath bomb ever.  Besides arriving cracked in half, the integrity was poor and not consistent with the pictures of a distinct cloud.  When placed in water, there was minimal fizzing and no distinctive colors emitted.  Dissolved completely in about 30 seconds.  Certainly not worth the cost.  I bought it for my 3yo son and it was more of a negative experience than if I hadn’t gotten anything at all.",Negative
Wanted to like it but it was a big hoop for my nose..,Negative
"This item came in a flimsy cardboard envelope. I opened it and it was just a blown up print I could have downloaded and printed my self for less than $1. The quality is horrible and the wording is slightly fuzzy. It doesn't come with a frame, just so you know.",Negative
This plate has already faded to the point where you cannot see it. Very poor quality,Negative
It was really awfully hard to put on,Negative
This necklace looked very nice but the stones started falling out the first time I wore it.,Negative
"I was so excited to try this deodorant, especially after reading the 5 star reviews. Unfortunately, this one doesn’t doesn’t help squash the pit stink at all for me. I had to reapply after 3 hours, again at 6 hours, and by dinner time I needed to wash my armpits and start over. I have been using a different brand of natural deodorant for 3 years, and felt that it was time to change things up, but this deodorant is not the solution for me. I like the essential oil scent, but it’s not enough to mask the stink.",Negative
Fake Lang don't buy this crap!,Negative
"I really wanted to love this, so dainty & easy to shape but I cannot wear it a day without it irritating my nose. I’ve never had issues with this piercing, but every time I’ve put it in the next morning I have to take it out as my nose gets red and swollen/painful. Similarly priced jewelry has never done this.",Negative
so thin it broke when I was taking it out of the box. Not at all what I expected for the price. This is more like a $10 item.,Negative
"This was a present for a friend, broke almost immediately.",Negative
"The crown looks pretty decent, but parts of the print had holes and one of the crown points is tilted in toward the body of the crown. I filled these in with hot glue. I expect it will look very good once I sand and paint it though.<br /><br />Three stars since I wasn't comfortable sanding and painting outside of the box.<br /><br />EDIT: Since my review, one of the not reinforced crown points has begun to fall off. This seems to be lower quality than I initially thought.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product at all.",Negative
"Very pretty sign, bought as alternative guestbook for my wedding in July. However, it arrived late and broken. Tried to contact the seller and couldn’t. I’m hoping wood glue will hold this together.",Negative
"I love the description - Highly Scented!  Yeah, til you burn them.  I loved the scent of this wax melt but when I put it it the burner, I got a strong scent for five minutes and then it smelled like wax right after that.  What’s the point?  I buy a lot of wax melts but won’t be buying this brand again.",Negative
Very poor quality - it fell apart the same day we received it.,Negative
"What a disappointment.  I just got my order today and was looking forward this body powder. (Nantucket)  Absolutely no fragrance.  For this price, and not even a powder puff, I had bigger expectations.  Perhaps this is why there have been no reviews.",Negative
Ok,Negative
Horrible! Smells nothing like it’s suppose too and I returned them.,Negative
This product belongs in the garabage for what it’s worth.,Negative
"Nothing like the photo, and although I understand that stones come in natural variations the one I was sent isn't attractive at all, mostly solid white and nothing I want to wear or create jewelry with.  Not worth $1.",Negative
"The seller does not do color so you are unable to see the design easily because it is the same color as the band, I got a white one you can not make out that it has anything on it",Negative
I love the art but I'm very upset that one of the portats is missing from my package. It advertises 3 but I only received 2,Negative
It's a unique ornament for my lab loving daughter but  the hanger was not put on properly (through the silver ring so the ornament will hang properly) and upside down. Hanger was also scratched up and bent.,Negative
You get what you pay for! Lesson I need to learn,Negative
"What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.",Negative
I wore these out to dinner and when we got home I noticed one had broken and fallen off. So disappointing because I really liked them.,Negative
"Color is too bright, reminds me of the  sail cover for a boat.  The fitting is too lose, making wrinkles. Returning this purchase.",Negative

Turns upside down.,Negative
Genuine Leather is not good leather. You get what you pay for.,Negative
"I ordered an XL, I am normally a 2X in women’s tops or a size 16 for reference. The shirt fit great but the image on the shirt was half the size expected. It made the shirt look super cheap and the only reason why I didn’t return it was because I got it the day before I actually needed and I had no other option. It works fine for a one day use. I needed it for my sons Toy Story B’Day theme. If the image was as shown It would have been a shirt I worn regularly. Very disappointing.",Negative
"The words are faded and blurry. Cheap material and you can find bigger and better quality pictures in Burlington, Home Goods, Kirkland or Marshalls for less. Save your money",Negative

This was a Christmas gift that we bought a friend. Unfortunately it's too late to get him something else instead.  The stone is so bad that I am embarrassed about the ring. The photo posted is nothing like what you'll actually receive,Negative
Cheap looks like it came from the dollar store.  I don’t understand how they could ask for so much for this garbage.  Not worth the money,Negative

"Plants are barely alive, and one is really small, just coming out of the shell, that is not what it shows.  OMGosh the money I wasted on this buy.  I would not recommend this seller or product.",Negative
Bought this for a Christmas gift for a co worker. I can say I am a bit disappointed in the actual size of the air fresheners. They could be a little bigger.

This product was poor quality and not as described.,Negative
Broken before I got it,Negative
"The chain is cheap, almost seems like plastic. The coin itself isn't as heavy as I thought it would be. Doesn't feel like it is made of brass...not much at least. Don't waste your money.  I'm trying to return the item and so far no response from the seller. It's been days.",Negative

The color was not what I thought it was. Dull and boring.,Negative
This earring made my ear sore and irritated.,Negative
"I loved this necklace when I got it, and have gotten many compliments on it.  But now two months later the plating has almost all but rubbed off.  I will admit I didn't see the warning in the item description advising not to wear it while doing anything that might make you sweat, but I didn't wear it while working out or anything.  Just regular, casual wear and not even every day - part of my jewelry rotation of every other day or every two days or so.  It wasn't expensive but now I can't even wear something that was purchased because it had meaning for me.",Negative
"Major disappointment.  When the ""cut to fit"" stickers arrived I could have screamed !<br />For the price I paid , i expected what the listing said, ""precision cut"" for the Outback.<br />Good quality sticker, will give them that . BUT, $50 for a ""generic"" sticker is robbery .",Negative

"Purchased the art unframed and had it framed as a Christmas gift.  Christmas morning when my son opened it, he immediately noticed that the author’s name was misspelled as “Ruyard Kipling” — the print is beautiful I never even noticed.  I tried to contact the shop to have this error corrected — but couldn’t get past the amazon seller assistance bot.  I requested a refund and will be looking elsewhere for a print of this poem.",Negative
Not a poster!!!!  Very very very small,Negative

"I had these for quite a long time, 8mm size. Looked great, very comfortable. Had to remove them for surgery recently. They were lost so I ordered new ones. After literally countless attempts at fastening them to wear, they are all bent and the earrings never did get fastened. Didn’t have any help, so the cost of the bent up earrings is frustrating. Wouldn’t buy them again for this reason.",Negative
Just don't waste your $s.,Negative
This bow has no drawback and you can’t get it to properly shoot an arrow. My son has owned a similar bow before but the string was made of actual rubber and worked way better. This was a waste of money.,Negative
I wore these to sleep. One came out while I was sleeping and I can't find it at all. These are so tiny. Its a bit of a bummer to spend almost $20 on earrings that are so small. Other reviewers are right - these aren't at all like the shapes in the pictures. Not a fan.,Negative
"Estoy extremadamente desilusionada del producto. Esto no es lo que pedí. Comparen el color de la piedra que me mandaron con la foto donde dicen que es una tanzanita original, natural. Me dieron gato por liebre. Me siento estafada. Me mandaron una amatista. No me gusta.",Negative

"I bought two of these tags for my kittens.  We have only had the tags for 3 days, but they have already gotten pretty scratched up.  One of them arrived with a small scratch, but I didn't want to wait for a new tag to come in.  I don't think they're going to hold up very long since they scratch so easy.  They're super cute and I really love them, but with very minimally amounts of wear they are already looking a little rough. ):",Negative
I paid the extra 3.00 for the 19’ chain and I didn’t get that. It’s still the small chain. I like the necklace just upset I didn’t get what I paid for. I wanted a longer chain so I could wear this necklace with another one but I can’t it’s not long enough.,Negative
"Not pleased. Came from sellers home printer on photo paper with the word “coco” cut off. Word was not centered either.

So disappointed in this item.  When I opened the package I was in shock how small it is!  You can't even see it on your keyring.  Its literally the size of a DIME!  If they made this actually a &#34;normal&#34; size it would be adorable.  This is a JOKE!  Would NOT recommend!,Negative
Not able to give a gift,Negative
"I ordered this as a Mother's Day gift from hubby  The product arrived quickly, however when I placed it on my finger it looked extremely cheap. I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.",Negative

Very small,Negative
"Smaller then I'd hoped,  some of the letters were bent wrong and cut poorly. I regret this buy as it was in no way worth what I paid for it! It came VERY QUICKLY though.  Perhaps if they'd taken more time,  a better product would have resulted.",Negative

Really expensive for the size was expecting somenthing else.,Negative
"I expected this necklace to be much  larger. My fault. You are using cm and I’m used to inches for measurement. I will be returning, not worth $45 for the small necklace.",Negative

Color is not as bright as I expected. Excellent customer service. I wud buy from this company again,Negative
Sent back,Negative
This is just a print of a picture fuji glossy paper…<br />Very disappointed.  This is not a poster or anything  even close.  It’s a equivalent of a 59 cent Walmart print,Negative
"The absolute worst graphic I have ever put on in my life. It did not stick, it’s thin, made poorly, and the center letter is completely out of Wack. It was a capitol E and the horizontal top and bottom line didn’t line up at all. Guess you get what you pay for.",Negative

It was too small for an adult.,Negative
"It's definitely sturdy and a great concept if you're trying out a nose ring without an actual piercing. However, it was very sharp. It's flexible no doubt but be careful with it.",Negative
These literally look like cheap plastic children's earrings. Look like something you would get out a claw machine at an arcade for a couple tokens.,Negative

Waste of money,Negative
"These were perfect and cute for about 4 hrs, until I decided to just change my shirt. Immediately got caught on the earring, ripped it out of my ear and bent the earring beyond the point of being able to bend it back into shape. Complete waste of money. If you so much as bend this somewhat the wrong way, you simply cannot get it back into a circle and it’s garbage. Shame.",Negative

Came rusted and wasn’t the exact measurements waited 2 months for nothing,Negative
This product did not stay in my piercing spot.<br />It fell out repeatedly until it got lost.,Negative
Received a picture of a  design of a head!,Negative
"Purchased this item for my laundry room for clothing I prefer to air dry rather than put in the dryer.  If I hang more than 3 items on it, it falls over.  Had to place it leaning into the wall.  I think it would be stronger if I could tighten it but the powder coating is on the threads and I can't get it to tighten down any more than it is.  Not sure what to do with it.  Not an easy item to pack up and return.",Negative
Turned my hole and the skin around my piercing green!!!,Negative
These are HUGE. NOT 3/4 inch,Negative
This decal was terrible to put on the wall. We rubbed the lettering for a long time and it still came up while we were applying it. It took me about 30 minutes to apply it. It looks ok from afar but it looks like garbage up close because the letters won't adhere to the wall.,Negative

It broke,Negative
"A bit flimsy, the plastic curled up after 2 applications",Negative

Not a plaque! Paper,Negative
Was not color pictured.,Negative
"Cheap plastic. I’m not impressed that you made it on your 3D printer. I should have read the description closer. I relied on the picture, which along with the price, had me assume it was a nice metal cookie cutter. It is NOT.",Negative
What a dissapointment. The package smells good but it ended there. No scent while in the warmer,Negative
The shirt was ordered black with aqua glitter letters. The letters are more of a blue glitter than aqua. Tossed it into the donate pile since it's the wrong color.,Negative
They looked cheap and I returned them,Negative
Absolutely terrible quality “poster”. Save yourself time and money and just print the picture off a computer yourself. The 8x11 literally is just a blurry printed picture. This is not a poster-quality photo. Terrible purchase.,Negative
Looks like orange glass.,Negative
Smells nothing like play dough unfortunately,Negative
Feel slightly misled as it is printed on cardboard. That being said it is a quality print. Just expected more.,Negative

"The Hardwood Tortilla Press looks beautiful, with fine workmanship and all. There is only one problem - IT DOESN'T WORK! It flattens the dough to about a 3 and 1/2 inch circle, and that is it -- the rest we had to roll out by hand.

Can't smell them at all,Negative
Resin- not actual stone or rock,Negative
I felt disappointed! Very poor construction and wood isn’t really a hard wood. More like birdhouse wood. Small sign and the color is way off from the picture.<br />Don’t waste your money!,Negative
"I ordered the silver ring for my wife, but our daughter’s name that I asked to be put on it can barely be read. Several other people have commented on this so we are not alone. It does NOT even look remotely close to the advertised picture. Very disappointed in my purchase. I guess I will be buying another one from somewhere else.",Negative
Pictures are deceiving and so is product description.  The bracelet is extremely thin and it bent out of shape simply putting it on. It would become misshapen I'm sure when wearing. Very thin and malleable.  Doesn't look or feel anything like it was described.  So disappointed. Returning it.,Negative
Make sure to check size. They are very small. Not as pictured,Negative
It was very small for the price I should've paid attention to the size n price because I can go local n get much cheaper n bigger but the product is pretty and different,Negative

"This is a truly terrible product! So poorly created. The images are cute, but they’re impossible to remove the sticker from the paper without ripping the entire sticker. I was able to salvage 16 stickers, the rest ripped and went right in the garbage. The break in the paper should make them easy peel in theory, but in actuality not the case. Very disappointed that I spent $10 on these stickers. Save your money, or just throw $10 in the trash.",Negative
First ones ordered  came apart.  Replacement: box smashed posts bent.  Rather disappointing,Negative
Completely disappointed. I ordered a 23 in a $85 wall art of a pitbull in a dark Rusty copper. For my son who is in Florida. After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.,Negative

"Pretty, but I asked for a different clasp and dislike the one put on (Per other reviews which is why I wanted a different one). It doesn’t lay flat on your wrists and therefore always locks up and doesn’t allow my watch to track properly. I don’t wear it. :( very disappointing",Negative
I am very disappointed by this product. The letters are not as neat as they pictures show. My daughters name starts with a M and the M has thick mountains which make it look very cheap. I am upset with myself for spending this much money on this.,Negative
Awaiting an answer on how we can fix it need it for my wedding in 4 days 😭will update<br /><br />Update no one ever reached out!<br /><br />Order in advance advance it’s not solid wood so it’s very fragile especially depending on your font and name!,Negative

Very disappointed .For $18 all you get is a a printed piece of paper that you have to frame yourself,Negative
Love the shirt but it came with a stain and a hole already on it 😕,Negative
Garbage. Super flimsy. It comes out when you blow your nose or catch it on a towel. Don't waste your money.,Negative
This is the biggest scam I hv ever seen sold for $12 on Amazon. I could even make this myself. Too pricey for the piece of cardboard that was sent. Unimpressed.,Negative
"When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.",Negative

It was nothing like on the picture,Negative
"These are tiny, not the 2 inches as indicated, will be returning.",Negative
Loves the item until it broke after 6 weeks of normal wear.  The string did not appear to be that strong at the joints around the beads.,Negative
It came cracked nearly in half in one spot. So not impressed,Negative
"They cost as much or more than a 78 card deck though there are only 15 cards. Doesn't beak down time very far. Within a week is smallest time, within 5 years largest time frame. Also has 6 cards of the 15 that say do it, wait etc.. Barely more than a magic 8 ball. I was a bit disappointed.<br />Though they came wrapped nicely.",Negative
"I waited for this necklace for 3 weeks. While unwrapping it, I noticed several pieces. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and some how was still shattered. I spent an hour with a bottle of super glue trying to put it back together, as it was a gift. It could have been beautiful, but even with all the work putting it back together it looked awful. I would not recommend this product.",Negative
Can not read the word twin that I had inscribed.,Negative
The chain is copper and the pendant is fixed to the cheap chain.  So pass it up until they up the ante.,Negative
not what I thought it was,Negative
"It came all clumped up, it would not move around. Very disappointed especially as I purchased it as a gift.",Negative
"I tried to return this item and was refused by the manufacturer. The size is not something I want to put on my tree or to give as a gift, which was my intention. It looks out of proportion to a normal sized ornament and now I have no use for it. Unless you want a huge piece of cut wood with your dog’s name on it, get something else. Which is what I had to do. Very disappointing!",Negative
Nothing special. Sent it back. Looks cheap,Negative
"I specifically bought this because my skin reacts poorly to anything other than gold, silver or surgical steel. I'd like to believe this is truly 14K gold filled, but my nose got inflamed and irritated after wearing it for one night. Maybe it's 14K gold filled with some kind of plating on the outside... I don't know. I've had my nose pierced for 12 years and haven't reacted to 14K gold before, so not sure what happened here. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this.",Negative
I really wanted to wear the small hoops to hoops and each air they’re very comfortable however to close down is difficult there was always a gap behind my ear which would snag my long hair or a sweater that I was getting into and that was a pain or hooking on a scarf I wish I never spent the money on these,Negative
The quality was poor. Utensils were stained & the personalization was faded on the majority of them.,Negative
They look cheap,Negative
Very well made but because of size very difficult to install always bubbles,Negative
"This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better",Negative
It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.,Negative
I would make sure you buy the biggest size because for 17 bucks you get a tiny sticker which in my opinion is not worth it for the price!,Negative

"Although they are pretty when viewing them on one side, regardless of which ear you put them in, they look backwards when you put them on and they are tiny. They are definitely not worth the price and look like children’s earrings. I wouldn’t have paid more than $30 for them.",Negative
The product is really poor quality. Just blocks of wood with adhesive letters that come from. Three arrived damaged and they were mailed so poorly that the package was ripped and blocks were sticking out. For the money the vendor charges for the product and the shipping I strongly suggest you go elsewhere or got to a craft store and do it yourself. I am disgusted.,Negative
Didn’t have post to wear it’s like a cuff,Negative
"I Didn't realize when I chose a thread color that it would all be that color. I chose navy and even the flowers were in navy. I figured the flowers would stay pink (like in the listing picture). Also, the flowers in the picture are different (and are way better looking) than the flowers on the one I received. I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.",Negative
Good if you don’t have metal allergies. I’m allergic to non silver or non gold jewelry. Wore this for 3 days and I have blistered hives all around my neck. This is the worst allergic reaction I’ve ever had to jewelry. Only buy if you can wear any metal.,Negative
"Not what I expected-not very sturdy and too thin. Will not bend to tighten up. Therefore, it comes off easily. Not happy with it at all. Would not recommend.",Negative
"Nice necklace but the thingy that I suspect adjusts the the length on your neck won’t move. The chain is too delicate to force it.  If I can’t figure it out soon, I’m returning this necklace.",Negative
I found the scent not pleasant or calming,Negative
It only a 8x10 photo.. not even in a frame.,Negative
Should have included paints.,Negative
"(1) It took over a month to receive<br />(2) Poor quality, it bins and the color changed after getting wet.",Negative
For the price I paid I was expecting a Sterling silver chain. Was not very disappointing. Giftable but who wants a necklace that is going to change color because it’s fake silver. Not me. Pretty but upgrade to Sterling and I’m sure you’ll have a much greater turn around. Aloha!,Negative
It’s a great necklace but the birth stones were placed in the wrong names.,Negative
"Very difficult to get into my ears. I wish they worked, they are cute.",Negative
"Looks like something from a cracker jack box, definitely returning and will not buy from this company again",Negative
Quite disappointed to received a well packaged box with NO earrings… only a pair of earring backs…. Returning it now….,Negative
The sticker was nice and high quality but so much smaller then we thought.  I wish I work of read the size better.  For $11 it’s a ripoff for how small it is.,Negative
Very cute but did not realize it was only a sheet of photo paper. For some reason I thought it was on tin and could hang it up on its own. Have to find a picture frame for it.,Negative
It turned my baby arm colors,Negative
"I spent over 100.00 on this. I thought it was engraved writing but instead it’s a cheap sticker for the letters. The sticker was bubbled and lifting up on some of the letters.<br />I bought for a wedding gift, I’m embarrassed to give the newly wed couple this.<br />Don’t waste your money",Negative
These earrings are no where near worth what I paid from them. It is as if I got them at the dollar stores,Negative
Looked nothing like the picture was not the carat weight showed in the picture maybe a moonstone but it's not a rainbow moonstone buyer beware,Negative
On my wrist one night in the theater and the beads started rolling off like overflowing popcorn from an overfilled container.  Disappointed.,Negative
Not at pictured.  Plain white glossy paper.  No edging as pictured.  Very expensive for what it is.,Negative
I had to pay shipping for another one because the original broke trying to get it off the cardboard. Way too much glue used for shipping.,Negative
Was not as elegant looking. More like macrame<br />Too expensive for poor quality,Negative
"Please save your money and time and do not buy this piece. The quality of the product is very poor and is NOT worth the money being charged. You can find better for much cheaper. To makes this worse, the seller will not approve of a return despite the quality of item being a huge disappointment. Very disappointed and do not want someone else to go through this.",Negative
"Very cheaply made. Flimsy plastic, not chalkboard material as described. Sending it back immediately.",Negative
Decal is peeling after minimal use and hand washing only,Negative
Product arrived a week after scheduled. Charm is so tiny you can’t tell what it is.,Negative
"Tried it on muscle back pain,  didn't work. Tried it on headache, alleviated a bit.  Also, container is not easy to use when trying to rub it on your side, for instance, because you have to keep your finger pushing the roll because otherwise, as you rub, it slides close again.",Negative
This is not good sterling silver it get dark and my ear starts itching doesn’t worth the price,Negative
The earrings tarnished almost immediately. I wore them once. Not worth buying.,Negative

I was so disappointed when I received these ear rings that I bought for my daughter for Christmas.  They are so over priced and look so cheap like they came from a dollar store.,Negative
"I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.",Negative
"Very cute cozy and works well to protect the hands from heat.  However, after a few weeks of use it is very stretched out and sits just under the lip of the cup instead of around the middle of the cup where it belongs.  Spend your money on something that will hold it shape and last longer.",Negative
The embroidery was good. Pillow flimsy and small,Negative
Terrible!! Not what i expected.,Negative
They stickers didn’t come apart the entire sheet would lift.,Negative
Pretty product but it came in ripped,Negative

"The sign was gifted and hung outside on August 18 and today is Sept. 17 and the sign is ready for the garbage can after just 30 days.  Seller cannot be reached, so it looks to me he knows about his dishonest way of advertising the sign as being ok for outside with wording 'pool sign' and 'lake sign'.",Negative
"Folder was very nice but description states 2 folders, I only received 1.",Negative
I like the style of the bracelet but after the 1st wear it no longer stays tightly on my wrist so I’m continuously pulling the strings to secure it. Slightly annoying,Negative
Turned colors quickly. Looked cheap after that.,Negative
"Sadly this was a huge let down.  $30 down the drain because it is so tacky, cheap & wrinkled paper that would not hang it.  I should have filtered by stars.  My fault.",Negative
Cheap product overpriced and charm is huge,Negative
Product was wrong stone and very small.,Negative
smaller than Letter size paper-I should have read description better because would  HAVE reconsider buying<br />When kid asks for a poster fro their bedroom and then they get this ...there will be disappointment<br />internet  described poster as 18 X 24 or 24 X 36 OR 27 x 40<br />DECEPTIVE HEADLINE!!!,Negative

Been buying larimar for years.<br />The big chunk is an example of lab created the tiny chunks what I got same consistency...,Negative
Extremely too small,Negative
Broke first day I wore it,Negative

Sadly this clock died about a month ago. We tried to replace the timing mechanism but it didn’t fit even after careful measuring. Very disappointed.,Negative
"Wires are very thin and bend easily.  They also work their way out of my ear, and I have almost lost them a couple of times.  Not my favorite earrings due to the poor quality.",Negative
I liked the fact that it publicly identifies like- minded people like us.,Negative
Cute shirt but very  short length. I’m only 5ft 3 and it was maybe 2 inches past waist. Not flattering at all. And I ordered the largest size that I could.<br />It will be worn at home only!,Negative
Both frames were loosely put together.  One side on both frames were not flush put together.  There was a visible gap in the wood.,Negative
"The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.",Negative
I tried to get used to the smell but I can’t. This smells really bad and it reminds me of cheap incense. Nothing about it smells like vanilla.,Negative
"The metal strip arrived after 2 weeks rusted and 1/8"" thick, I was under the impression that I was getting 3 pcs for $35 instead one PC, of rusted metal, the ad is misleading and you can get for 1/2 price better metal in Homedpot.",Negative
VERY disappointed!  I received my case in the mail on Friday and my name has already rubbed off!  I’ve only had it for 4 days!!!!,Negative
"Fantastic quality, very adorable. My issue was with ship time. It states to allow 1-2 weeks for your package to arrive. However, it Took 4 weeks for just the hat to be delievered. I ordered it 3 weeks before my sons newborn pictures expecting it to arrive well before. Causing us to have to have the photos taken without it. I’m hoping it still fits at his next photo session, but it is on the smaller side so I am not sure",Negative
 ,Negative
Turned black. Not happy!,Negative
I bought this for my daughters birthday I really like it. My only issue is I don’t feel it’s worth the price it’s not really all that big but it turned out pretty I just think something like that should not cost as much as It did so I only gave it 2 stars because of the pricing,Negative
It’s snapped when I was trying to barely open it,Negative
"You need to have a customize option on all your canes that it's available on. Put it in a tab before you place your order. I love the look of this cane and in the description, it tells you that you can choose from several colors and lengths. also, either brass/gold or silver hardware. But when I went to order this item, it was just going to send the 36” walnut. It becomes a huge hassle. I noticed that you had a customize option button on another one of your canes. It fit the description of the item perfectly. This cane, and many of your others say one thing but don't offer that option. ( Even though it tells you it's available.) I would just make it simple for the customer, either change the description to one stature or put that button on all of your items that have the description offered. It would ensure the customer has some choices and received the product they truly want. Also, would save you guys time on returning messages and having returned items. This means more revenue for your bottom line with less time invested to do so. I need a 37-1/2” to 38” cane. This would hurt my back to use at 36” for a prolonged period. You make a fantastic product, change this one small thing and I myself would have purchased several of your canes alone. Thank you for your time.",Negative
"So yes, they are cheap in price but you get what you juyst for. Three come in the package which is nice because the first I used immediately broke so I had two more to replace it. However, they are both gone now too.<br /><br />Very cute charms but all three are lost now.",Negative
Pretty ring. Just wish small stones surrounding center larger stone were all still in place.  Several fell out first time worn. Looks really cheap and will not wear it now. 😔,Negative
Shotty printing and printed on photo gloss paper. Nothing to hang it with and a waste of money that we could have printed on a normal piece of paper! Returning,Negative
even though this toe ring is adjustable it is way too big for my toe....,Negative
On trash can and they didn’t stick,Negative
They are cute run small and if u need them for a certain date you better order a month ahead of time. Took over  4 weeks to arrive.. Ridiculous,Negative

Arrived broken.  The chain was broken when i opened the package. Upset that I wasted money.,Negative
a lot smaller than expected. you pretty much get a print out on some glossy paper. i could’ve did that myself. ultimately i understand it’s my fault that i didn’t read description close enough.,Negative
I bought 2 of these. I live in a 550 Sq ft apartment this did not fill my home in any shape or firm with a wonderful scent. Couldn't really smell it.,Negative
Love the hoops but the wires are so fragile that they pull off my ears at the slightest tug.,Negative
"don't bother buying this product, I received 5 small stone the size of your pinky finger nail nothing like what is says.sooooo disappointing .",Negative
"I bought it for my grandson, looked great for a few days, after that, the chain started to turn “silver” but the name plate had stayed gold, the lettering is very faint and not with deep engraving, can’t hardly read it.",Negative
Stencil is hard to read. Looks home made on a used piece of wood.,Negative
Great words but not worth the money at all!! I'd rather do these and have them laminated myself at a cheaper cost.,Negative
Would make a nice sweater pin. Much too small to be a hair pin.,Negative
All good,Negative
Too thin. Not worth the price.,Negative
Paid extra for this shirt. Quality was not great. Shipping was 6.99 in order to arrive on time… that was a joke. Came late now not needed and to return costs another 7 dollar shirt. Cheaper to toss.,Negative
"If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.",Negative
"I have had the necklace for less than a weak, and already several of the chain links have become bent and deformed. Some are even sharp and prick the skin, making the necklace uncomfortable to wear. Very disappointed in this product's long-term durability.",Negative
Really small.,Negative

"Cheaply made, both of mine are already coming off. Been on a few days, don’t waste your money",Negative
crappy product and not worth the price.,Negative
"I have never given such bad ratings but guess there is always a first time to everything. I am struggling to find things that is good about the nail paints. They are one of the most streakiest, thick, and aweful to layer nail polishes I have every worn in my life.. save your money.",Negative
Dislike,Negative
"Loved the pic!  I didnt know about ""Only good for polyester. "" Transferred to cotton and was very dim.  Picture itself is very light to begin with.  I ended up highlighting and repainting with my material paints.  It turned out really well with a lot of effort.  I wont buy from this company again.",Negative
Wore for one week and initial cams off of bracelet. Cheaply made.,Negative
"Cute design, however...the chain turned a copper color after the 3rd wear.",Negative
Super cheap,Negative
"They are a lot smaller than I thought they would be, and the hangers are really thin and easy to bend.  I don't think their worth the $14.00 you pay after shipping charges. I can't decide if I want to return them because you have to pay to ship them back!",Negative
"Received as a thoughtful gift from the hubby and my 2 boys.  Cute design,but the gold color is a bit more brassy or reddish than the yellow gold color in the picture.  Would not have purchased if I had seen it in person first.",Negative
"I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!",Negative
Very pretty and dainty but poor craftsmanship. Wasn’t properly soldered where clasp is attached and fell off while Christmas shopping. Wasted $350+ for someone else to enjoy or sell.,Negative
NO PILLOW came!! My son just got the pillow case.  We are both very disappointed,Negative
"I would have loved this product if it did not smell exactly like vomit. I can't describe it any other way, there is some vanilla scent to it, but mostly a strong smell of bile.",Negative
"First of all they stated they shipped my product weeks before they actually did, I had to contact Amazon before they actually shipped it! Then I receive the product and as I am trying right now to put the decal on my car, the contact paper is crap! I have put so many decals on my car, I’m a pro at it, it took so much work to release this decal from this cover paper they use to put it on my freshly cleaned window for it NOT TO EVEN TRY TO STICK TO MY WINDOW, like not at all!!!",Negative
Really? Using that title as advertising for women?,Negative
"Before purchasing, be sure to click above on ""Take It Personal"" where it says ""Ships from and sold by Take it Personal"" and read about all of the shipping issues. Don't expect to get it right away. It's definitely a unique pet ID tag, but I felt the writing was too big and it looked crowded, even though it was just my dog's name and my phone number. I also ordered three colors, but they made the face white, which I wasn't expecting and didn't want. Maybe I overlooked that in the instructions.",Negative
This is cute!  Looks nice on my girlie home office desk. I love it!😍,Negative
I asked for this necklace for Christmas and was so excited to receive it! Fast forward a month and a half and the chain broke! So bummed out. My son is devastated.,Negative
Bad smell and does nothing to reduce dark spots in spite of using it 3-4 times a day for weeks.,Negative
Only 1 of 4 that I ordered had the copper coil.,Negative
Cheap Frames and 2 of the pictures were blurry. Not worth anywhere near $50. It was also an opened box and there was a return slip in there from July 2022 (5 months ago) from the last person that purchased it.,Negative

"Disappointed.  The name is just cheap foam letters. It's ok. He's 5, he loved it.",Negative
Had to unravel the whole brown paper roll because the pole was to thick,Negative
The color of the stone is very muted/dull.  It does not hang properly as it is side mounted and tends to partially flip over.,Negative
This sign should be for free! Poor quality! Broke within a week! Very disappointed!,Negative
Too small,Negative
The stickers were too small. I have returned them,Negative
Guess I should have read the description. Literally $15 for a picture pritened on a peice of paper. I could have done that myself for way cheaper. Plus I thought they were printed on canvases and now I have to go spend more money for frames.,Negative
The paper printed on was just a regular piece of paper I could have done myself.<br /><br />Won't be coming back to this seller.,Negative
There are multiple flaws in the craftsmanship . Black marks that were very noticeable in multiple areas. There were multiple splinters in the crevices as well. Wood is thin . Seller agreed to a return with a “ restocking fee”. This was a gift that I am unable to give. Very disappointed.,Negative
This asked me to provide specifications. I did. They weren't followed. You'll also need pliers.,Negative
stakes bend when trying to put into the ground. not worth $40. I should of spent $120 for cast iron or wrought iron.<br />can hardly read the address number due to black lettering and no back round.,Negative
Her facial expression is not... I mean... it looks like she her stomach hurts and she needs to excuse herself to use the restroom in the middle of a sensitive conversation.,Negative
I can not wear it. It pinches my neck and I can’t get my refund because I have no way to print the return label,Negative
The size was right but the good side had the sticky glue so unless you are putting it under glass it is useless<br />However I sent an email and was promptly refunded for the purchase,Negative
To small,Negative
Dont waste your money. Its extreamly over priced. Poor quality for $65.00,Negative
"The pendant is cute, however is much more bright silver colored than the “antique” finish it was advertised to be. Also, the chain comes on is extremely lightweight and flimsy. I just use this charm with the chain I have from another necklace.",Negative
"So, it broke on one side out of the box. Husband still loved it and wouldn't take it off. Less than 3 months later it completely broke.  Looked great, engraved beautifully. Just can't hold up to constant wear.",Negative
"Returned. It’s not a kitchen towel, it looks like a decor.",Negative
would love to buy this for my grandson  but no where to personalize it,Negative
"The wood is very thin and I would almost say cheap. You have to slide the two pieces together when you get it, no biggie, but they don't click together.  My husband doesn't like how easily they separate.",Negative
Arrived late and damaged,Negative
"I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say ""This is ok""<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said ""This is ok""  Well it wasnt ""OK"" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.",Negative
"To small, gave them away.",Negative
I don’t even know why it would cost so much for 1oz. I can make this myself and save a boatload of time and they hid my review with the sensitivity filter.,Negative
Could have literally printed this off my computer off google for free,Negative
"I was very disappointed to see this wasn't a plaque or anything,  just a print out on photo paper which I could've done myself.  However,  I didn't pay enough attention to the details because I was eager to order it to complete my bathroom decor.",Negative
Looked better in picture than in person.,Negative
Pretty ring but however it broke within 2 weeks of wearing it.,Negative
The product is just some pictures printed out. Definitely not worth the money!!,Negative
"they tout it as so custom and great. I've decorated an entire room w decals and they've been all purchased on amazon and are awesome and sturdy. This is flimsy and just....junk. Tacky. Looks just tacky. and then I put it up and it ripped. Just great. Asking for full refund. Honestly, beware. look elsewhere. expensive and just awful experience.",Negative
"Beautiful Sterling Silver chain but the main feature of this necklace, the Harmony Ball, is NOT Sterling Silver. It is tarnishing after just a few weeks of wear. I've tried to polish it with Sterling silver paste with no improvement. Very disappointed.",Negative
 ,Negative
"So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. ""Rustic"" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.",Negative
These should be 2 for $1 considering that they look like printed images like one hour pharmacy type images,Negative
Missing 2 pages. Also the page were cut weird and on thin paper,Negative
"Absolutely purchase this T shirt if you are a size 00. It is darling, to be sure. But Unisex sizing? No way.  An american Unisex small has always been my go to size. Not fitted, but not super loose. Enough room to fit the girls in without having them scream at you, you know?<br />I ordered a unisex Small, and I'm quite sure it is for a 12 year old boy. Some baseball moms love to have their ta-tas do the talking, I'm not that mom. Quietly melting into the background is more my style. This shirt will have any mom being the center of attention, to be sure.  Not only will your boobies look enormous, as this cheap fabric is stretched to it's breaking point, you get the added benefit of a crop top, so when you sit on those bleachers, your entire crack will be skillfully displayed to all of the curious on-lookers in the seats above you.<br /><br />Basically. Order 3 sizes up.  Or better yet, maybe don't order at all. There are no exchanges, and no prime shipping. There are plenty of other shirts just like this with better prices, better customer service and free shipping.",Negative
Too small,Negative
These charms are not worth the money they turn colors really fast,Negative
"Although the plate is beautiful, the holes do nothing align with the screw holes. I see at least on other person experienced this flaw. This needs to be remedied. Also, screws for the plate should be included",Negative

I wear a medium or large. I ordered a large and XL. They feel like a child’s large and XL. The letters ripple when on. Not impressed.,Negative
Color pencils will not cover lines. Great pictures for painting only.,Negative
Way too small besides 2x2<br />What r u going to do with that Highly over priced,Negative
Looks like metal actually made of cheap fake wood mom sad,Negative
Great fragrance but dissolve so quickly not worth the money!,Negative
"it did not finished. it's just wood.<br />I don't know how to use it outside.<br />It will be soggy and get mold very soon...<br />I regret buying it.<br />If you buy it, you need to put some water coating on it.",Negative
Was going to put stickers on my cooler and they won’t stay on. Magnets are ok.,Negative
"Although this sign is cute,  it’s very very cheaply made. It’s just a very thin two by four with stenciled paint on it.  Prob costs about 2.00 to make. I’m keeping it as it’s too much trouble to return. It is cute but not worth the 30 bucks I paid.",Negative
"i have never wrote a review, but i will now, this is 2.00 junk i paid 100$ for on ebay its 2$ and they will not refund you, dont waste your money!!! mine bent as soon as i put mine on, i will not be giving my sisters their presents because the quality is so low.",Negative
I order the set of six and only got 4,Negative
"I've been using it daily since receiving it and haven't seen a lot of growth, but will update in a month and let you know. I like that there is not an overbearing smell and it's not heavy",Negative
"I loved this scrunchie but did not get to enjoy it past two months. The rubber band just snapped while I was wearing it, just fell out of my hair.<br />The return window should be longer than a month!",Negative
"Dont do like i did, read the description!!! Its just a copy on a piece of paper worth 10 cents.",Negative
Got wrong color sweatshirt order sand and got gray and tex on sweater was supposed to be white and is not other wise nice production was right color,Negative
Purchased this on the claim it was highly scented. Perhaps I received a defective one but my wax melt had little to no smell at all. I kept waiting for the scent to fill the room and it never happened. Clearly disappointed for the price. I'll stick with the 2.00 ones at the major stores; at least I know those do their job.,Negative
THIS WAS PRINTED ON NORMAL STOCK PAPER. NO GLOSS OR ANYTHING! BETTER TO PRINT AT A WALGREENS THEN ORDER FROM HERE.,Negative
Cheap looking,Negative
The printing is so faint that after two months it is unreadable.  Save your money.  It will be of no use if your pet is lost.  The people who find it won't be able to read the tag to contact you.,Negative
Way too small,Negative
Kids size and thin material.,Negative
They’re like using threaded earrings - terrible for your skin. They’re causing soreness and irritation/inflammation. Definitely worth it to pay a dollar or two more on Etsy for a better hoop.,Negative
Very! Very ! Very small order twice your size  I won’t even be using mine !! 😬,Negative
"This anklet is not at all what I expected. Very cheap, someone just sewing a piece of material.",Negative
"First image shows the product advertised, next one actually depicts what I received and then I added an additional photo, including Aquamarine stones plus the earrings.",Negative
product descrption says real stones. all you get is a very bulky wrong and cracked colored glass,Negative
Looks cheap.  Opal looks like glitter glass.  And sharp edges.,Negative
Smell was good but didn’t last long at all.,Negative
Chain was flimsy and it was described as unisex. For a girl it was OK,Negative
"It’s ok , I kept it but it does not look like it’s worth the price I paid, does not look or feel like silver. I would not recommend it.",Negative
Picture is blurry. It's not very high quality up close.,Negative
"Don’t waste your time ordering this , it does not stay in your ear .",Negative
This is literally a piece of thick paper with artwork I could have made myself on my own computer! I assumed for the price it was going to be better quality! I am very disappointed!,Negative
"Although the print is pretty, the &#34;placemat&#34; seems to be just two pieces cut from a tablecloth and sewn together back-to-back.  Plus, I assumed the order would include four placemats, but I only received one.  I submitted a request for returning it to Amazon, and received a reply that they would contact the vendor.  That was several days ago, so I am definitely not satisfied.",Negative
"I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the ""clasp"" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.",Negative
Super cute! But too small and it pinched the inside of my nosewhen I tried to close it,Negative
I love the principle of screw on backs but the posts are so long the earrings stick out too far.,Negative
The product kept sliding down the stethoscope so it makes it very irritating!,Negative
"The back of one of the earrings were bent. And the butterfly’s were paper, like maybe glued on? But definitely paper. I just threw them away.",Negative
Not the best product. Itchy and too big. Not what I thought. I guess it was my mistake.,Negative
The slope of the hanger creates an angle that you can’t even hang anything on this hanger.  Nothing stands on it.,Negative
"Was very excited when I found this bracelet for sale. Upon receipt of the item though, I was extremely disappointed with it. The color of the bracelet I received is considerably lighter than the amber colored bracelet advertised. I would love for the seller to replace it with a bracelet that has more amber colored beads!",Negative
The wire is too thick to fit through the holes in my ears.,Negative
Very cheaply done. Engraving is very shallow and basic. Not the gift I’d be proud to give.,Negative
No chain extender is actually included despite being in the description several times,Negative
I ended up returning this bag because the magnetic snaps that hold the bag closed pulled out of the leather because they are so strong.,Negative
Looks nice but is plastic not metal.  Not sure why it advertises to be metal when it is plastic.,Negative
Working item was sent.,Negative
Don’t buy! Shirt did not fit correctly and I returned it. I bought this shirt for $28 and refunded $16. Plus I had to spend $8 to ship it back myself. So I only got back $8. Don’t buy! If you need to return it you’ll lose money!,Negative
The bottle just exploded on its on. Thank god I was not holding it. Can I get a refund please?,Negative
Cheap plastic product. Not worth buying. Over priced. It’s plastic.,Negative
This was waste of money.,Negative
Super thin bends easily. Didn't wear well. It just could be me but I'm not a fan,Negative
Quality is below average,Negative
This picture suggests that this is a roll of decals. It isn't. I received one decal and it cost me $9.00. I am so frustrated. This was supposed to be a stocking stuffer. Very disappointed!,Negative
I was completely aware that the frames were not included but I was surprised to see the quality of these pictures. It looks like they printed it out from their home computer on regular paper. I could have done just as good on my own printer and saved A LOT of money! Very dissatisfied.,Negative
Hahaha definitely not a toe ring!,Negative
This peeled off within a week.  Seller said they would replace it but never did.,Negative
3D printed.  Seems like prototype quality or less.  I highly doubt it's food safe.,Negative
They lost color and tarnished within a week and I can barely read the print. Great idea but poor quality.,Negative
expensive for what it was. had to spend additional $12. For basic frame. I wanted to love it but didn't. love Bowie love cats.,Negative
"My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 ""boba"" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.",Negative
"I just received my leather wallet with custom engraving. Though I like the rustic design and rather lack of finish this has a major flaw that makes it unusable. The credit cards don't fit, it's not a thickness issue as my driver's license doesn't fit either. The pockets are not wide enough which makes me think this one wasn't made properly as the one in the picture has cards in it. If I try to force the card down I'll damage it so not sure what to do wtih this wallet now but definitely back to square one and keep searching for a wallet.",Negative
"This is not Sterling silver,  my skin is very sensitive and had to take it out immediately.  Very pretty tho.",Negative
This print is a horrible recreation of the original. Do not buy this.,Negative
"they were broken when i received, still haven't been able to wear",Negative
"The size was way off! Original ordered a medium, it looks like a kids…. Then I ordered a large and still looks like a kid…. Didn’t even wash or dry the medium and I may as well paint it on…. The material is stiff…. Extremely disappointed!",Negative
"Pretty misleading honestly from the pictures. I thought I was getting all the colors shown, but there was just the one redwood. It is shown but I dont like it, it looks like a faded red. Its soft and okay ribbon, but I wouldnt spend $11 on it, especially when it's only 5 yards. You have to look at the details on this item and I didnt and I'm sorry I didnt. I tried to return the item before it shipped and nothing happened. I'm not gonna buy from them again but I dont put all the blame on them for me being dumb.",Negative
"Was excited and can’t wait to see it. Open the package and was in shock and big disappointment, it is just a sheet with printed Justin Timberlake on it. This is not even a towel! Look very cheap too.",Negative
Really unhappy they look scratch and dull it’s just not the quality I thought I’d be getting.,Negative
"This is a rip-off, seriously!  I know the description states the design/text is only on one sheet of the roll and is not a ""sticker"" but they sure do seem like stickers to me, whether they're ""heat-pressed"" or not, the price is absolutely ridiculous, or ""highway robbery"" like my parents used to say!  Even if the seller charged a more reasonable price (like 1/2), they'd still be making quite a profit as the price of $15.00 for one roll with heat-pressed stickers is incredibly exorbitant!",Negative
kind of dull,Negative
Very thin socks- not worth it,Negative
Do not buy this. It is a one sided 8 X 10 document that is not worth the price.,Negative
It’s too tiny.. Not fit for adults. The clasp is also lose for one earring. Too much hassle to return so kept it.,Negative
There is text printed over text. I had a replacement sent and still had the same problem and just returned for refund.,Negative
Arrived in a broken package so after opening the yellow mailer confetti spewed all over my living room. It also looks nothing like the photo. They are all the same mm sized pieces and none of them have a shimmer.,Negative
"I ordered 2 of these. One for me and 1 for my work bestie. We have different names and I placed the order accordingly. I got 2 shirts with HER name and 0 shirts with my name. The seller ignored my messages to discuss the order, mistake, and what we could do moving forward. Tee is cute and comfy, but the seller hides from mistakes.",Negative
"As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open. The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY! On another note: at least the driver followed instructions! Good on them!",Negative
"I’m sorry to say it, but these are just images printed on card stock and they’re very small. I could have done this at home on my own printer.",Negative
Uncomfortable. Didn't like the look it and didn't fit right,Negative
Picture was cheap colors looked weird somehow you just have to see it but I dont recommend so take my word for it,Negative
I ordered medium I would hate to see what the small looks like!! Not as described very disappointing!!,Negative
Super cute necklace that I was excited for. But the clasp is messed up! Super disappointed<br /><br />Edit: got a replacement but once again the same use. Sadly will be returning.,Negative
Even though this bracelet is fashionable don't for one second be fooled that the stones are genuine.  So disappointed and I feel cheated and robbed.  Please... if you do purchase know it's just for fashion (1 star for that) not for spiritual or meditative uses.,Negative
"They were a pretty gold color when I got them, but after a few months, they are a dull silvery color. Maybe it’s my fault for wearing them continuously, including in the shower. They are very lightweight.",Negative
"I ordered from  Country barn babe because  all the reviews were great and all five stars. I guess I didn't have as good a luck. Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.",Negative
Pretty product but it came in ripped,Negative
The smell reminds me of lemon soap. Lemon with a soap undertone.  I was so disappointed with this scent. Will not buy again.,Negative
Don’t waste your money,Negative
"Warning! Not good for use as a walking collar. We bought 3 of these. So far the rambunctious 2 year old has popped the buckle, broken free when exerting a little resistance against the leash.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE COLLARS for anything other than a cute collar to wear around the house. Not for exercise.",Negative
I purchased this product unfinished and was sent a wood filled not completed product. Then was told look at the pictures on the site when asked for a return. Also said I didn’t respond in time which I did it took 2 claims for them to respond to me. For $144 you should expect something of quality not a sloped together board.,Negative
Mine looks nothing like what’s pictured. It’s just dull in the background. My name is in blue when I wanted in a pink color. I really don’t like the way it came out and it was delivered late by 6 days!,Negative
"I was disappointed in the quality of the leather, and the overall size of the ""leaf"". It was too wide for my fashion tastes, and the navy color was dull.",Negative
Poor quality,Negative
"Poor quality, sloppily made. You can see damage on both sides where care was not taken when the opposite side was stamped. Not worth the price.",Negative
"The actual charm is cute, the chain snags hair and loses color within 1 day of wearing it.",Negative
"This sucks! Letter broke, so I waited until my so. Which does this so often came home from college! His first response was where did you get this mess from! Ordered another one from a popular site they use, came out perfectly and beautiful",Negative
Product doesn't work don't buy from co. You need to pay for return about 18.00 not worth the it.,Negative
"This ring is not sterling silver. Within 2 weeks, the metal was flaking off. Gave me an infection from the flaking and the base metals.",Negative
Very flimsy and light. Broke and lost a piece after 3 wears,Negative
the letters and numbers came off,Negative
"I am disappointed at how cheap the stones look. I realize it's cultured to look like sea glass, but it's done poorly. Both the colors and the cut (much bigger, and much less dainty than the photo) are incredibly fake looking.",Negative
These were really nice and we spread them all over the tables but 15$ was WAY TO HIGH FOR LITTLE PAPER THings. Way to expensive for something you could make by yourself!,Negative
Ok,Negative
Terrible quality. Just painted onto over stained goopy wood. Sign fell apart the second we went to tap it into the ground,Negative
The sentiment of the gift was great but the quality very poor. Broke on day 2. Would not waste the money.,Negative
Not worth the money,Negative
They wear slightly. But it stays put. Its a sticker... its fine.,Negative
"The font  that I ordered was not what I received,  and the names are tiny.  I guess you get what you pay for. Also, the advertising shows a heart on the necklaces,  but when I tried to get one on my order, it made me take it out.  1 good thing, fast delivery.  Would not recommend.",Negative
it came as letters with holes punched that were too small to get the string through and 3 pieces of string to rope them all through.  I could have done this myself.,Negative
Wanted this as a sweet 16 keepsake for my daughter signed by all her guests. This item felt more like a thick piece of paper coated in a layer of shiny glue. Ripped when trying to take scotch tape off that area.i wouldn't buy again for the price I paid,Negative
It’s a photo. You have to frame it. Otherwise it’s just a piece of printed paper. Super disappointed. I guess I missed that in the description. Would not recommend unless you’re up for a craft night.,Negative
Too flimsy. Easily broken,Negative
"These wax melts are advertised as being vapor rub scented which should, in theory, help when you're congested and need a little relief. Great idea which is why I purchased them. In reality, the sent of these wax melts is so faint I can barely smell them when I stick my nose right up to the was warmer. Even then, the vapor rub smell is ineffective. I hope this vendor will work to improve the product but until such time as that happens, it's not worth purchasing.",Negative
"too blurry of a picture, I think they could have improved the quality",Negative
"The sizing is off, it is way too large compared to the item description about the sizing. Also, I wrote the name and bride so that they could do the initials lettering but I was disappointed when the robe came in completely wrong. They wrote out her name and put bride in really small writing. I know that mistakes can easily be made, especially with customizations so I reached out to see if they can fix this, since this is a gift and the bride will be married in less than two weeks. They were short and rude and offered me no solutions. Don’t recommend, be careful when customizing.",Negative
Blush awful color never buy again,Negative
"40 4x6 photo prints.  Arrives in a thin cellophane wrapper.  No box, no instructions.  If this is all you want it's fine.  Not really worth the $ if you ask me.  I had ordered for a gift and will be returning.",Negative
"I got the same wood letter at the craft store for $3.59 with a peice of paper glued to it, which hung off the sides... i already had the wood and the paper i could have made it myself for less money. I had hoped for better quality.",Negative
Tiny. Return it,Negative
Muy decepcionada con mi orden. Las letras son muy finas y la madera de muy mala calidad. El nombre se rompió por la mitad antes de que pudiera utilizarlo 👎🏻,Negative
Don't forget to read the fine print that there's not a frame included. I would've never bought it if I'd have seen that.,Negative
"This is soooooo cheap. I bought it as a gift for my assistant, but now I'm<br />Embarrassed to give it to her! It's like tin with silver pair on it-- like something from<br />A gumball machine!",Negative
They are black and white and do not look professionally made.  Anyone with a computer and printer could do these. Very disappointed. They were only $12 but not worth the money for 60 stickers I could have made myself.,Negative
TINY BEADS and defective close,Negative
I thought it would be heavy and not what I got would not buy again,Negative
The name was only 3 letters long. I would think that the letters could be bigger. It was a gift and he didn’t even notice his name it was so small and unnoticeable.,Negative
"Don't waste your money on this.  It's very pretty, but arrived broken.  I tried to contact the seller and they never responded.  I was hoping the seller would have made it right, but I did not hear back from them.",Negative

The necklace nice but it’s fake the unnatural black lines give it away I’m sending it back give the buyers a choice to purchase fake or real crystals smh,Negative
ordered the equine one with my initials and it came blank with just my initials. I would’ve ordered another color and design from someone else but ordered this one specifically for the horse just to not get it.,Negative
"It's a good thing my sister in law has a good sense of humor. The dictionary page this was printed on had definitions for urine, urinary, uterus. Not necessarily the page I'd have chosen to print it on.",Negative
This was HUGE had to return,Negative
"Cheap, poor quality elastic. Broke very quickly.",Negative
I got these for a baby shower. They are so tiny. There is no way to incorporate these into the decorations. Very very disappointed. (And I bought 12) ugh!!,Negative
"Very displeased looks nothing like the photo. Chain in very cheap, pearl is un describable. The necklace looks like something from a carnival or machine in grocery store. I bought for a gift cause pearl is the birth stone but to ashamed to give it so throw in drawer with jewelry the grand daughters play with. Don't waste your money",Negative
"I like the idea of the product, but for the money the quality was low grade",Negative
Absolutely horrible. I got a refund thankfully but these are made from a foam type of material. Very thick and very ugly in person. Sorry to the people that own this business.,Negative
The scent is not what I was expecting - not like driving by a citrus grove with the beautiful aroma.  However it is not unpleasant.  Will not purchase again.,Negative
Does not “glow” stone color is dull.  Return policy not like Amazon.  You have to pay to return. Etc,Negative

Print was crooked and off center..obviously a terrible product with Terrible production,Negative
"This sign was very well-made and is on a thick piece of wood, but for some reason there was a square brown stain around the whole word “bakery” and in between the letters. It was wrapped in plastic and there was brown stain on the plastic inside. I was disappointed because I really liked the picture of the sign that I saw online. I ended up having to return it.",Negative
"Didn't fit even after trying with a hammer... I could have made these, rubbers ones fit much better but these would look the part if they fit... oh well...",Negative
Not as displayed at all.,Negative

Too bulky,Negative
To small,Negative
"While the hoop is very cute and dainty, the hoops did turn colors after a month or two. I am not satisfied with this purchase, because the “sterling silver” turned black. The sizing is great in my double helix but they quickly changed tone.",Negative
"The ring lasted three whole days. It was on my finger, looked at my hand, and it was bent. I had not endured my hand or injured it in any way. Have no idea what happened. I noticed it was fitting tighter. That’s why I looked. I have ordered lots of things from Amazon, and this is the first thing I have had problems with. I was very disappointed.",Negative
Junk,Negative
Broke first time I put them on,Negative
It’s a tiny amount for the price.,Negative

"I got the package and it showed no damage. Once I opened it though, I found the product broken.",Negative
Not large at all. Couldn't get any smaller be hard to fit even the smallest cyclic in or any small flower. Horrible mold on the shape of it. Not a good deal for 10 bucks let alone 30. Stay away,Negative
I didn’t know it was a poster it was just something I could’ve copied off my own printer,Negative
"I did like these little studs but I was skeptical about the backs.  Turns out I had good reason, I lost the 3mm stud and back along with the 4mm stud and back two times. By some miracle I found the 4mm and back in the bathtub.  Now I have lost the back to the other 4mm stud.  The backs are little pieces of plastic that seem to loosen easily, they are clear and impossible to find.  For this reason I would not recommend to a friend.",Negative
Was looking forward to this.,Negative
The photo made the pendant look clear and the stones looked bright. What I received was cloudy plastic filled with what look like paint chips 😔,Negative

I received the loofah and sponge yesterday? followed the instructions and placed them in water. The loofah immediately formed but the sponge is still sitting in water a day later flat as a pancake.,Negative
The design looked wonderful but the shirt is very rough and scratchy material. I would have given 5 stars if the shirt was soft,Negative

Nothing good to say so say nothing,Negative

Small!,Negative
Was hard to apply to the surface,Negative
It turned colors after maybe 1-2 wears.,Negative
Not a high standard or high quality product very disappointed in the whole situation. Tried to return it before the end of the window for returns and the seller nor Amazon provided me with the opportunity to be able to return it even though I had until January 31st. Highly recommend not doing business with this company due to the lack of quality and workmanship with this product. Very cheap looking quality and workmanship,Negative

This is very very small. It shows wall decor over fireplace. This little bitty thing is no bigger then my damn hand. I’m very pissed.,Negative
Poor quality,Negative

Beautiful and I love it. But so delicate you need someone to do it for you.,Negative
Complete waste or money and it took forever to deliver on top of that,Negative
Way to big.,Negative
The anchor on the anklet is not secured by the beads as depicted. So the beads slide everywhere as well as the anchor with the tiniest of movements. It was not worth the money. I suggest securing the beads so the anchor will not mobe.,Negative

"DO NOT BUY, is not like picture! very thick and a waste of money",Negative
"I did not realize how tiny these would be! They are so small for the price! I also have a problem with them sliding back into my ear because they are so small.

This was way to big for a kitchen towel and to small for a bath towel cheap decal. Nothing like I expected,Negative
This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another. It was very uneven. I was looking for navy blue and light blue which was shown in the picture and it came out as dark blue and purple which made it look a little girly for a boy’s room. The product was expensive plus shipping was not just worth my money.,Negative
The name plate area was much smaller than the original photo displayed.  I couldn't even easily read the name without a magnifying glass.<br />This is a result of not being able to actually see the product before purchasing.  I wouldn't have purchased this product.,Negative
Only one print was sent and delivered. It would have been great to receive both prints as that is what I paid for.....,Negative
Fake tarnished in one week,Negative

This necklace broke my neck out very cheap product This company didn't refund for my return  .,Negative
"This product was just card stock with the image printed onto it. If it cost like $2/$3 that would be one thing... but for the cost being what it is, a frame should have at least been sent with it. We returned it because it was literally just a print on card stock... we could have done that ourselves.",Negative
My daughter was eagerly waiting for her cloud slime. What we received wasn’t cloud slime. It was more like putty or regular slime. Definitely not cotton slime. We are really disappointed.,Negative
[[VIDEOID:f83281026daf500701dd542c118d2b25]] Great quality first two wear a year ago and held up well. So I purchased two more as a gift. Simple and great value.,Negative
The small bic lighter dioes not fit. The leather case is too small.,Negative
"It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.",Negative
Cute.  Smaller than I realized (my fault).  Didn’t work well for me  —I needed a two sided sign.,Negative
"Come on.  Look at it.  Seriously, take your time and observe it.  Scroll through each picture and slowly review each one.  And like me, you will realize this thing is basically a few simple cuts of plywood that have been stained and assembled using the cheapest legs you can purchase from your local hardware store.  Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!",Negative
"Definitely not anymore breathable than a t shirt material one. Also doesn't absorb moisture, so moisture just sits on your face. Significantly stretched out within first week of wear, now hangs of the bottom of my chin. Definitely not worth the price, in my opinion.",Negative
This is not real chrysocolla. This is some cheap died stone.,Negative
Really dull looking...I thought the colors would be brighter on the shirt....I hate them,Negative
"I am not a huge fan of these, unfortunately! They feel like the same quality as a paper clip that's been bent into a spiral. I don't think they are worth the $15+ price tag at all.",Negative
Not the right size. No rings came with it. So I cannot use my old one.,Negative
Delivery date changed five times; seller won't answer emails. The final product is SO plug-ugly in person.  It looked and felt like a used diaper hanging around my neck.  The pictures make it look way better than the reality.,Negative
A lot smaller than expected with nothing shown,Negative
I reached out with emails twice...did not receive a response. They yellowed right away and the springs<br />separated at the jointed area. Wanted to love them.,Negative
My bracelet is mostly black with a few beads showing a bit of blue. Not the more grey/blue shown in the picture. I gave it two stars because the quality is good and fits great. I just wasn't looking for another black bracelet.,Negative
"My onesie is fine, not cotton so that sucks. Polyester material, and it came with a stain on the back of it. The design is not vibrant either but that's probably due to the shirt material",Negative
Itsss sooo small for 15$ should been made silver,Negative
Extremely delicate chain broke 2nd time wearing it trying to open to take it off,Negative
The writing is so small you can’t read it,Negative
I was being lazy since I own a silhouette machine.<br /> I could have done just as good of job and probably better since I could have just made my own custom decals,Negative
"When the product arrived it was definitely not what I order it has 3 gold balls on the end it was  thin and cheap looking , I will be returning!",Negative
"The photo leads one to believe a substantial item is being offered. I received an item about the size of a piece of notebook paper, not as advertised in the photo or text. Disappointed.",Negative
Looks nothing like the picture. The prongs don’t even secure whatever this stone or whatever is supposed to be. They look INCREDIBLY cheap.,Negative
Took 1 hour to stick it to my wall using a credit card. Very small I ordered the 18x12 thinking that atleast the race track would be big enough for my son's hotwheels to drive on but it's smaller then a hotwheel. I have spent $28 on a big Forrest decal that covers my entire  wall for a master bedroom then I spend $25.88 on this decal that took more time to get on the wall and it's small. Not worth the money and time to me and my son only played on it a total of one minute which I expected but it's just frustrating how hard it was to stick to my very flat wall that has litterally no waves or anything like that to prevent it from sticking. The look is aesthetically pleasing but other then that it's not really something I'm happy with throwing $25.88 at.,Negative
I bought these as a gift but they are not worth the price. The product and packaging feels very cheap.,Negative
Surely no one would admit to being the quality control person on duty the day mine was made . It is variegated purple like printer was low on ink.  Yes too inexpensive to send back but really ?,Negative
I followed the easy instructions to apply to yeti cup...it barely adhered...very disappointed... looked so bad i easily took it off after about an hour,Negative
I wore this necklace for 4 days and the ball fell off of the base losing the mustard seed!! So disappointed,Negative
Very cute but did not realize it was only a sheet of photo paper. For some reason I thought it was on tin and could hang it up on its own. Have to find a picture frame for it.,Negative
NICE SELLER. Just wished bag was bigger,Negative
Earrings are owls not angels... was a birthday gift... all paperwork reads angels!🤬,Negative
The problem I had with this product was no piercer was willing to put it in for me. The end was snipped off that would go in your nose. It wasn’t tapered but a flat end. Would have been painful too put it in . It looks pretty! I just wish I could wear it,Negative
Somewhat disappointed.  Gaps between planks.  Did not look worn.  Not painted on the back.,Negative
"Very cool looking,  however , we cant take it off the wall because  it won't stick ! Left it on for a month and still won't stick",Negative
Brought 2 of them for my granddaughter’s wasn’t the right color birthstone March and I don’t think they’ll take them back I’ve been trying to return them,Negative

I haven’t had this bracelet very long and beads started falling off.  Poorly made.,Negative
This is not true to what was advertised. I am very disappointed. For $29 I excepted more.,Negative
Nooo m gusto en las fotos de miraba redondo y es cuadrado muy grueso no lo recomiendo ☹️,Negative
Way to small and when trying to make it bigger it broke,Negative
"The products were cheaply made. The word family was broken. Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.",Negative
"It was so small that it barely fit around the nostril. It was very thin, which is fine, but the diameter was sooo extremely tiny that it did not look good.",Negative
Don’t waste your money. Looking for a goldfish in the soap. It’s a purple blob? Also looks like it has legs. So disappointed.,Negative
"Flower is bigger than my head , too big to use",Negative
Fabric was a very stiff cotton and ran very small. I am usually a women’s size 4 and I could not even get the shirt on. Small is more like a child’s size 10. If you return you need to pay for return shipping which at the cheapest may cost around $10. I would only buy if you are willing to lose money.,Negative
"Bought this as a gift but it looks nothing like it was pictured.  Real lapis is suppose to have gold or white specks in it (as pictured on the piece I ordered), but this is plain dark blue and an obvious fake.",Negative
Cheap material - didn’t last ..<br />Broke the 1st two weeks my kids used it,Negative
"The clasp was very cheap plastic material, if you’re okay with that then it’s pretty cool.",Negative
"It came damaged. Not exactly as pictured either. Which wasn’t a huge issue. But it being damaged is not acceptable. There was no hole in the box it was shipped in, so it had to be done before they packaged it to ship out. See indention and hole in poster in photos. You can see my poster is slightly different as well. (Has square outlines around dogs; again that particular thing was not a big to me, but just so others know).",Negative
"WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE ITEM, I WILL BE RETURNING IT; HOWEVER, IT IS VERY WELL MADE",Negative
False advertising you advertising said 8.5 inches and is only 8 inches long,Negative

"Found the ""AllLivesMatter"" people",Negative
"I purchased a wedding band that looked great but fell apart after only 6 months. It took a month to get &#34;repaired&#34;, but that only lasted for a week and a half before the wood feel completely off the steel<br /><br />STILL haven't heard back about a refund for a terrible product so the best I can do is warn others",Negative
Pretty but scratchy,Negative
I did not like this mask. I could not breath with it,Negative
These were difficult to get in my daughters ears but I was pleased they didn’t fall out like others. However the earring was caught in her blanket & no she no longer can wear them.  Disappointed bc they were so cute,Negative
"The wood is too thin and fragile. When I opened the package the item was broken. The letter S was completely broken and the whole item was spray painted but did not had a top coat, causing the sign to smell like paint.",Negative
Did not smell like lilac hardly at all,Negative
"I sent this soap to s relative and received a call from her about it. When she opened the package, ants were all over it. I told her to Toss it immediately. Do not make this purchase.",Negative
I was hoping this would be more substantial. I'm sorry I don't have better things to say about this.,Negative
Terrible. They put the name of the recipient in green letters behind light blue water background and you could not see his name at all. It was not a good sign at all. I had to go over it with black magic marker so that we could at least see the name of the recipient. I couldn’t believe that they even sent that to me knowing that there was no way that they saw the recipients name. It was that bad!!! NEVER AGAIN!,Negative
Definitely not worth the price for what I received.  Disappointed.,Negative
The seller did replace with the same thing but it looks the same. Not giftable,Negative
It's not real jade.. And it pissed me off that its advertised as white jade and it's not even close.. Its some kind of glass.. Faus advertisement is illegal last time I checked.,Negative
I liked the personalization and it arrived with a cute purple organza bag but the necklace broke within 3 days of my daughter wearing it. I definitely think it should of lasted longer.,Negative
THIS looks great in the misleading pic on Amazon.  In person; looks like something out of a bubblegum machine.  Not worth $46.  Maybe $15 and that's pushing it.  Cheap monogram lettering quality too.  I'll give it to my 16 y/o.  Perhaps she'll like it.,Negative
Washed on cold once it arrived and the colors ran. The design is now faded and it white. Very disappointed. Also sizing is huge.,Negative
To small and just a sharp metal piece that isn't like a real ear ring,Negative
So I thought these was pictures ready to hand on the wall. Not real pictures as if I took them and went and got. Them printed out now I have to do and find frams for these... my god I just wanted to hang them in my bath room now I have to send more money,Negative
I loved the wolf handle. The cane part did not seem as advertised. I thought it would be more of a hand made ornate cane.,Negative
"This looks like a cheap laminated xerox print out. 😒 Had I known, I would have created one myself.",Negative
This product appears as though it’s framed or at least printed onto a frame. It comes as a single sheet photo.,Negative
Not easy to remove didn’t like it at all,Negative
Too small,Negative
Very tiny cookie cutter,Negative
"The truck and personalization are printed in the side of the towel, not the center like most towels are. Very disappointed and unable to get a refund.",Negative
"The description was accurate, only I didn't pay close attention to the small print.  I was disappointed though, that it was so small.",Negative
"This product is poorly manufactured.  The backing material is stickier than the actual decal.  I had a problem on every single tree, mostly the backing pulling the decal off the wall.  By the time i was done with the last tree, i noticed the 1st tree i put on was begining to peel off.  Not happy at all",Negative
Loved this sign at first. However the colors do fade as other reviewers have indicated. The white parts have red outlines from where the black faded or bled over.<br /><br />We do not have this hanging near a window or direct sunlight. Very disappointed in the quickly fading quality of this product.,Negative
It’s not worth buying it broke as soon as I tried putting it on my ankle,Negative
Seems flimsy. Sharp edges.  Hard to hang without showing the nail.  Probably should have gotten a larger one- the small size isn’t exciting enough to fill up even a small space,Negative
The flowers were blurry. What a disappointment.,Negative
"lightweight, poor fabric and incorrect sizing. I bought this for a gift , but will not give it.",Negative
"Was shipped a box with two cotton covers but no ornament. When I requested a replacement, I was given an error message that the item couldn't even be replaced.",Negative
"Pretty ring, good size for me not big, but lost stone in two months of wearing it, I don’t do any house work in jewelry, so it’s just from wearing it.",Negative
Dislike this item earrings rusted quickly.,Negative
"The screen print was not as advertised in the picture. It is way bigger and covers almost the entire front of the shirt. The quality of the shirt isn’t great either. For how much this cost, I was expecting way more. Truly disappointed.",Negative
"For the price the stone was sort of ugly and small. The setting is great but compared to the other necklaces I’ve bought from this vender, I was disappointed.",Negative
I do not even recognize the item I received.  It is not a bracelet.  It is not silver.  I am really angry to learn to that I have no recourse for returning it.,Negative
"This is meant for a child's wrist. It snapped immediately while I was trying to put it on (adult male, average size wrists) and the rock fragments flew everywhere.",Negative
"Very rough representation of photo in item’s description. Little metal flakes falling off at the slightest touch. Expected more of a finished product, even when listed as “rustic”. Won’t be giving as a gift as expected.",Negative
This necklace tarnished after wearing a few times. It shouldn’t have done that as it claims to be sterling silver.,Negative
"The product looked great when it arrived, fit as expected and was really cute! Unfortunately after only wearing it once, all of the lettering in “Miss” peeled off.",Negative
"They are beautifully crafted but there tiny as hell..not worth money, to expensive",Negative
Broke super quickly. It was gorgeous but sadly broke.,Negative
"I like the bracelets but I feel ripped off bc I won’t be able to wear one of them bc I was sent one that was already frayed / defective. I opened it up, expanded the bracelet and found that the main rope is going to break if I try to put it on. Don’t know if that’s bc of bad quality rope, poor quality checking or just bad luck.",Negative
 ,Negative
DO NOT TRUST THEIR PRODUCTS they are poorly made and although they approved my return its at my own cost which cost more than the item I purchased!!! As they know most will not pay the cost because it just isn’t worth it. I RATHER THROW IT AWAY BUT WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY IN THE FUTURE. IF I COULD GIVE THEM A MINUS RATING I WOULD!!!!,Negative
"I am going to send this necklace back to you so you can see how it broke off and you tell me whether it was worth $32 for me to keep this broken necklace after having it two months I really liked it I liked the jade piece on it, but it is very saddening to me that you can sell something that would snap off the way this did For no reason and no way did I not abuse this when I took it off, I hung it up",Negative
"I had to return it.  It's great quality, however the picket is too small for the u.s dollar unless it's folded in half.  With means if you carry more than like one bill it's too thick to fit anywhere. Once I put a little cash my ID and a credit card in it would beraly close, glad they have a decent return policy...",Negative
NOT stainless….NOT safe or healthy.  Cheap junk.  I got an infection after 24 hours.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!,Negative
The packaging was awful!!!!<br />When I opened the package powder went EVERYWHERE!!!!!!<br />The powder is also disappointing. Not really a med or strong honeysuckle scent.  No puff to apply.<br />Will not be reordering!!!<br />Lucky I don’t sent it back!!!,Negative
Extremely small. Potential choking hazard to smaller children.,Negative
"It was fun to play with, and a neat science toy. Friday night everything was fine. I moved the magnets away from the ferrofluid and put the bottle on a shelf. The next day all the ferrofluid had hardened into this weird shape. Sad that it cost $30 and didn't last long.",Negative
I needed to use this for my husband man cave.. but when I received the order it didn’t look like his name Ike.. so I can’t use it.. the first letter is off. The craftsmanship was nice but other than that I wasn’t too happy.,Negative
"The necklace stuck to a magnet, it doesnt even look gold, looks silver and painted gold. Its fake or I was scammed and they gave me 10k. Not happy will return.",Negative
"Poster itself is nice, glossy and rich colors.  They didn’t ship it in a tube though and instead used a small, long box, which did not hold its shape and resulted in the poster that had been rolled up inside to have creases throughout.  Very disappointed in what otherwise was a great product to have been ruined because the seller failed to properly package it.",Negative
Lasted 4 months.,Negative
the pictures are very small. I was looking for something much bigger to place on my wall.,Negative
"The pictures sure are pretty, but the end product is a dull black. Bought as a mother's day gift and, while she was pleased, I am disappointed and ashamed of the quality.",Negative
I bought this necklace for my niece's 16th birthday in June.  It is already turning colors and rusting!!,Negative
I wanted. Drive Safe Dee Dee and on back Love Garrett,Negative
They won’t let you return this due to a custom order. Which is you choose the cord. Seriously!! It’s a cord. The pendant is so light it doesn’t even hold the cord down. A complete waste of money. And I never give bad reviews.,Negative
Less than two months and already faded,Negative
"The letters are very cute and this would be perfect if the vinyl wasn’t wrapped around itself in a circle when it was shipped. The clear layer was detached partly from the letters and base layer. I tried putting it under something heavy for a few days hoping it would flatten it and make it stick to the letters but no luck. We had to cut each letter, press the clear layer onto it and quickly do the transfer. Very disappointed",Negative
"Writing too small and not clear, I thought there was going to be real string on it for the lights. I would not buy this again, It is not worth $18.95",Negative
There's no way to get them in without ruining them. Dainty and cute but not practical.,Negative
Is not the standard outlet cover plate size.,Negative
"Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.",Negative
I have ordered other stickers for about the same price and received several pieces. I was quite shocked when I only received 1 sticker for the price paid. I should have read more in detail.,Negative
I have to admit that I’m NOT impressed. Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.,Negative
Nice size but the middle stone is not at all vibrant in color. It looks more like a dull and dismal stone that it not at all transparent. Extremely disappointed.,Negative

"I bought three of these as friendship bracelets for myself and 2 friends going on a girl's Caribbean trip. The colors were muted. Boring.

Classic but with a major mistake. Typo with you and your. :(,Negative
"I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6"" tall and the other 5"" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75"" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to ""make it work"" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.",Negative
"Absolutely love the dress, the only reason for a low star rating wi ordered a flower ring like the picture and I received a dream catcher picture on the dress.

Easily the worse thing I have ever bought from amazon.,Negative
"This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.  Will return.",Negative
I love the principle of screw on backs but the posts are so long the earrings stick out too far.,Negative

The engraving is of embarrassingly terrible quality -- the p is centered above the rest of the letters and looks like an upside down b.

The bottom half of the case is alright, but the top lid immediately comes off on its own. I tried to show this in the video, and as you can see, the back/top flat is too large and slides right off. Just submitted for a return or refund. Sorry if the video is a little shaky. I am just a bit annoyed because I was really excited and relied on the other positive reviews.",Negative
Not as vibrant as advertised. Not unhappy but disappointed.,Negative

Beautiful stone and ring however the setting is not stable and stone will pop out and be lost if you’re not watching which happened to this one and it was a gift hence the 2 stars,Negative
Nice wrapping paper took over a week to get to me,Negative
The seller did not state that the image is not in the center of the towel. It is near the left edge of the towel. This makes it difficult to hang as a decorative towels to hang in the bathroom or on the oven. I am disappointed.-,Negative
I was eager to receive natural citrine stud earrings. I was quite disappointed when I received yellow plastic earrings instead.,Negative
This was a gift for an oct 13th birthday and one of the three rings I bought has lost its stone already. Not too happy,Negative
Too big … was excited to have a “ petite” double ring. Thought it would be a flush fit but it protruded too much .. gave it to a friend .. she “ likes” it,Negative
Spinner rings fell off within one day of wearing.,Negative
"I gave this purchase 1 star because I ordered it October 14th.  Our Son's wedding was on October 24th.  The card arrived on October 26th, (Too Late)  Very disappointed.  While we know it's not your fault, you might want to rethink your current shipping.  It should not take 12 days to receive a card in the mail.",Negative
Disappointed so thin. Feels like plastic. Ordered Verde so I expected it to be Verde but it came copper. I assume it will  patina / oxidize overtime ????  Keeping it because it's cool/beautiful  and will be beautiful in the guest bath which doubles as a mudroom... yeah imagine that combo. It's an old house in the country that sits on the Rogue River in Oregon.  Fingers crossed it turns in time,Negative
My name was written so plainly rather than cursive. Looks like it was done with a sharpie. The top flap doesn’t secure properly. It keeps slipping off when I open the case.,Negative
NO,Negative
"I was initially impressed with the design. We kept it in storage in a dark, cool area. Checked on it to put it in our suitcase a couple months later and all the color, especially the black was faded with an ugly purplish/red color. Not that great of quality and we haven't even got to use it for our cruise yet.",Negative
A waste of my money! Very disappointing! I will never order from this company again!,Negative
The quality of these products are not good. Way overpriced for something that I could buy from the Dollar Tree. Pictures misleading.,Negative
"These earrings are too small for adult ears. Plus must pay postage to return. I will never order any jewelry from this maker ever again. In the aperwork, it mentioned nose ring, now if that had been mentioned right up front, I would never have ordered them.",Negative
Low quality,Negative
"Ordered some coin beads along with this pendant from two separate companies and the pendant for twice the price was barely larger than one of these coin beads. The beads have luster and I feel like all my other Larimar, pendant  does not.",Negative
"There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring ""no effort"" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't ""motivating"", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.",Negative
Received the cutter... NO STAMP in the package! Complete rip off and useless without the stamp.,Negative
Took this ring to a jeweler and was told it was not a real citrine.  Beware!,Negative
"It fell off, the iron inside the resine was too short.",Negative
"Not true to size. I’m 5’4, 135 and ordered a medium. It’s like an XL or more. I would need an XS based on this. I understand it’s customized therefore no return, however this item is unwearable.",Negative
Not comfortable to wear at all. There are SEVERAL better options for fake rings available on Amazon. Definitely skip this one. The design makes it impossible to fit correctly not to mention extremely uncomfortable. You're better off getting a permanent piercing or trying a different type of fake or temporary ring. this is just a plain ring that is damn near impossible to put on correctly and extremely uncomfortable.,Negative
"As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open. The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY! On another note: at least the driver followed instructions! Good on them!",Negative
Cheap looking,Negative

Don’t waste your money.,Negative
If there was a less than one star option i would have went with that. The product description says this is not very thick at all. The images would lead you to believe this is three dimensional....... it is not..... just a cheap one dimensional paper doll. I would recommend you pay special attn to the description and n I t trust the images. I would return it but it's not worth the time or effort.  Looks like they got me on this one.,Negative
"Dislike that I have to take of the pendant in order to open the pendant.<br />Dislike the poor quality of the metal. I have had it in a velvet pouch while not wearing and is completely tarnished. I have tried to clean with a Sterling silver cloth but will not get clean.<br />Also, the chain you get is not the same as on the picture.",Negative
Very disappointed with this gift and certainly not worth the price. Thought the lady bug was inside and ornament looks cheap.,Negative
"On the birthdate line, I requested “just never mind.” This was a Disney themed party for my sister in law and it was meant to be funny. It fit fine in the personalization form. It was left out. It was a disappointment and I wasn’t happy to not get what I paid for. Won’t order from them again.",Negative
Not happy at all with this,Negative
You can't get it wet or put it in the dishwasher. Very disappointing. Also does not seem well made.,Negative
It is too small,Negative
Faded color.,Negative
Very cute shoes BUT the color cracked in multiple areas the first week. For over $200.00....I would never buy these again.,Negative
I found the item to be very fragile for a metal art piece. The edges were still a little rough and might cut a finger. I had to take it to a friend to grind down the edges for me.,Negative
"Before it could be used,  the banner seemed to fade.. looked like a photo negative in places.",Negative
"Seller was great to work with during process. However when the sign arrived, even though the width was 6inches and length 22 inches, the characters themselves are only 2 inches wide, much smaller than the seller photos on the listing. The material also does not appear to be stained or protected from weather and water.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller, and unfortunately no resolution was provided by seller. There is also no refund/exchange protection for this item via Amazon. Be prepared to have no options or protection, if the item you receive does not match the photos listed.",Negative
"Very disappointed at the quality of the slime!  Super sticky. Seller sent ingredients to try to fix it, but it didn't work. We did as instructed and the slime never got better.  Very highly priced as well, especially for the quality of it.  Also Disappointed at the refund policy of seller. I've been buying from amazon for years and this is my firts bad expereince with any vendor.",Negative

VERRY DISSATISFIED. This looks nothing like the picture and they did my Roman numerals in lower case letters so there for it is not ran numerals.,Negative
It was very difficult peeling the small lettering from the backing and applying. Bought two of these decals and both had the same problems. Have used several of these from different manufacturers and had no problems whatsoever. Would not recommend,Negative
I waited a week for this bow because I thought it would be beautiful and well made  burlap material.  I could have just as soon bought this bow at Walmart for 7.99.  Very dis,Negative
It was not made very well as others Zelda forms we have purchased.  Its not worth. The 35$ we paid…. Get something els3e as this one is a great disappointment!,Negative
way to expensive,Negative
When these arrived in the mail my sister legitimately thought I bought earrings made for a doll. They're little more than a piece of wire in a circle. I lost one earring within a minute of opening them because they're that small and have yet to find it =(.,Negative
Having a hard time finding good smelling melts,Negative
I purchased this necklace fir my Granddaughter who is 15 and could not give it to her. The metal is very thin. The initial hardly showed. The Cain is very cheap. I wish I had never purchased it. I gave it one star because it was delivered.,Negative

I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PERSON AGAIN.! Highly DISAPPOINTED In The Outfit.

I Request A Refund And Was Denied But Was Told I Can Get A Discount For A New Outfit Then They Never Responded After That! I Disputed My Denied Refund And Was Still Denied For It ! The Seller Still Haven't Contacted Me! Such Bad Service !,Negative
Very tiny can’t see name I threw away,Negative
I don't know if you can see it but highly disappointed I received at tarnish nose piercing this isn't sterling silver 😡,Negative
Bracelet was very nice looking at first. The silver tarnished in a matter of days. Then the entire bracelet fell apart while I was sleeping. I contacted support and response was the 30 day return window had just passed. And  sometimes they fall apart while you sleep and to restring it myself because shipping is to expensive. Save your money and buy one that’s better made and better support.,Negative
This is not metal and isn’t engraved at all. I’m so bummed. It’s just a cheap printed on card. I paid way too much for a gift that was supposed to be special for my husband.,Negative
Definitely not worth 20 dollars AT ALL. It’s just printed pictures that you can print at Walgreens. It costs a dollar and change to look up the picture and do it yourself . Please do not buy and waste your time . Can I get a refund ? Lol,Negative
This is not real chrysocolla. This is some cheap died stone.,Negative
Horrible wasn’t<br />The right color nor size,Negative

"The whipped body butter is dried out, and the jar is half full. What a rip-off. It also took about 3 weeks to be delivered. It looks like a jar of body butter that’s been on a shelf since the 70’s. Definitely not like what they advertised. Do not order this product. I didn’t want to give it a star, but I couldn’t submit this unless I did. -1 star!",Negative
"I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!",Negative
Unraveled within a couple of weeks,Negative
I was highly satisfied with with stone itself. The band thickness is okay but turned my finger colors within a couple days wear. I avoided washing hands and lotion while wearing. This was not great value product. I've bought cheaper rings that didn't turn.,Negative
Don’t buy this or you will be disappointed! Nothing but cardboard paper that needs double sided tape to put in wall. Not very happy with this,Negative
"I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.",Negative
The pumpkins are good quality but they are small size. They are not big at all. Considering the overprice.....it is not worth it!,Negative
"I found the earrings very pretty online, but when the box arrived it was empty.  I received a refund from amazon, but what I really wanted was to have the earrings on time, they were for a birthday.",Negative
"I was charged almost $90 for someone to print on photo paper. I was expecting a nice piece, with a frame. Instead I got an 8x10 printed on photo paper.",Negative
Poorly made. Not safe at all.,Negative
Very cute but buyer beware this is just a printed sign on thin paper. You will have to frame this.,Negative
"It didn’t last 30 seconds. I’ve ordered other earrings from this company and I’ve been much more pleased. The leaf fell off within 30 seconds of trying to put it in and the earring itself is just very cheaply made, losing shape with the slightest movement. I’ve had plenty of luck with infinity hoops before but this was just a no from me. Unfortunately, I have to rate it one star.",Negative
"I thought I was getting a bit more than a piece of computer paper with this stuff printed on it, what a way to sucker people out of their money. I like the overall format, but I could of printed this myself on a crappy printer.",Negative
Unfortunately they lasted just a week,Negative
This is reasonably looking sign that conveys the message needed but the chemical scent that the sign has it overtly over powering to say the very least. It’s really bad and will make anything stored next to it smell the same.. 😬,Negative
Kinda cheesy looking in person,Negative
I did like the design. The rustic finish looks awful and cheap.,Negative
"I had to add some ""fluff"" to it to make it look like a special gift.  The idea of it is very cool but there could be some advancements in its presentation.  I wouldn't buy another one",Negative
I really think the product is very nicely made. The quality is good<br />However… I ordered the 18” and received the 12 in. I contacted the seller and it is not returnable. I am stuck with the wrong size!  I am afraid to reorder fearing I won’t get the correct size. I am sad because I really wanted it to work<br />Out!!!,Negative
The clock is made of very thin wood.  A little over priced for what it is.,Negative
GARBAGE! When I opened the box the ends of the headbands were broken and white ribbon used to wrap around the head band was untwined.,Negative
"Extremely disappointed with this purchase. It’s too small, not as advertised, cannot close . Just a bad purchase.",Negative
It was not at all what I expected it came too big,Negative
I must not have been careful when I read the description of this product. I was very disappointed in the quality for the price. The grocery list is on the front and meal plan is on the back which doesn't make much sense either.,Negative
"Attractive online according to the picture of the fleur de lis on the sellers door; however, it is smaller in reality. Measurements match their description but picture is deceiving! Not big enough. Returning to seller.",Negative
Looks cheap like I printed them at home. Not worth the money.,Negative
It was corroded before I even opened it. Tried to put it in and it was sharp made my nose bleed a little. Definitely not for those with a sensitive face.,Negative
"Here how it went for my order:<br />took two times longer then expected to get here. Missed the gifting window by a long shot, the writing is super small, the quality is as good as a Mall Stand. Wouldn’t buy again..",Negative

The neck line looks awful. It’s all scrunched up.,Negative

Not a real crystal...plastic!!,Negative
It was too short for my nose :(,Negative
DISAPPOINTED  THE NECKLACES STILL TANGLED.,Negative

So much smaller than expected,Negative
"Love the concept, but the kitten photo looks like a thumbnail that someone blew up. It's pixelated and very fuzzy, made more obvious by the crisp lettering next to it.<br />Not worth hanging. I regret wasting the money.",Negative
These are for a little girl or baby. Not for an adult woman. The pic is larger than the earring! Returning,Negative
Purchased these for my son who has a beard and he was disappointed to see that the mask did not have the expandable folds that the other masks I purchased for him had. This makes a big difference as no way to adjust.  According to him he would not recommend these masks.,Negative
Is very cheap it irritated my nose and it did hurt  me when wearing don’t recommend,Negative
Engraving was barely readable,Negative
It doesn't staying and it is bulky,Negative
Came wrinkled and smaller than a normal card. Please send better packaging for your other customers.,Negative
Look anive,Negative
"These are too small for my ear. I think that it is not actually 8mm. The clasp is ridiculously hard to put on, and it took 3 people and an hour to get these on. Once on, they are too small and hug my ear tightly without moving. These are also extremely bendable. If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them. Also, the material made my ears react to them and I have never has this problem before",Negative
Disliked,Negative
Too many details on this beautiful cutter caused the dough to get stuck everywhere and was ultimately non usable.,Negative
Small you need at least 10 for it to look decent. My waist beads i have from ghana covers them right up!. Colors are pretty,Negative
"The shirts were amazing! It looks just like the pucture. They were soft and run true to size. The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.",Negative
Was not turqoues did acetone test?,Negative
Nose ring look horrible,Negative
"They did say print only, unframed. The weight of the prints was nice, the pictures are as expected. They were not something we could use upon arrival. Framed nicely might be good for you all though.",Negative
"There is not enough contrast between the lettering and the background making it difficult to read. I tried to return it but my return ""request "" was denied. Ridiculous. Pretty unsatisfied. It won't be going on my wall. In the trash it goes I guess. Feels like such an unfortunate waste",Negative
They look beautiful but both earrings broke within a week of having them. Also they are way smaller than they look and they are cheaply made. Waste of money.,Negative
"I can't believe the price we paid for this item. The numbers are nice, but the wood looks just awful. It's ok from the street, so not worth the hassle of returning it. Save a ton of money and make one yourself.",Negative
"Beautiful but so hard to put on then came off when I washed my cup, waste of money",Negative
You don't get what is shown. Buyer beware!,Negative

The necklace was beautiful and the charms awesome.  However the clasp on the chain broke the first time I wore it.  I'm a sad about the quality of the chain.,Negative
Photography is misleading - makes it look like a bigger pendant and it's really small on a short chain.,Negative

Someone with a color ink jet printer and some basic Fuji photo paper just made some money because I didn't read the fine print.,Negative
Arrived 5 days late and damaged. Missed the birthday party it was intended for. Then I was asked to drive it 25 minutes away to return it in order to get a refund. Crummy.,Negative
"I had purchased this a while ago. The 'leather' material honestly feel quite cheap. Not as 'thick' as it is depicted in that picture. Also, the buckle at the back is just three holes with and a prong that goes through it. Not very impressed.",Negative
These are very pretty but way to small. The measurement is the outside of the white circle.<br />It would be nice if they were at least twice as big.,Negative
"I wanted to love these and I REALLY tried to. They work really well until you need to wash them, then they are never the same and do not perform like they did before. :(",Negative
The quality of the gemstone is not the issue. The issue is false description when the package states there are 3 pieces of opal instead only come with 2 pieces.,Negative
Didn’t really smell like anything :(,Negative
I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.,Negative
This bag came covered in ants and had a funny smell. The buckle closure makes it not very user friendly. It’s just been sitting on the floor collecting dust.,Negative
Doesn't seem to want to stay on.,Negative
The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name. I wish the engraving came in a different color or at least a little thicker. Did not meet my expectations like the photos,Negative
"First off....the pony is significantly smaller that what the sample photo indicates.  Secondly, it's supposed to be customized with the pony's name, and it arrived without the name.<br />Now I have to wait for the seller to think about accepting my return request.",Negative
I had imagined them yo be a bit larger and brighter in color.  It's ok though.  They are lightweight and don't pull on my ears.,Negative

"The toe ring I received has a stone that is white, matte and lusterless. I own a lot of silver & moonstone jewelry; stone shades always vary. But I'd never choose a colorless, faded-out stone like this. Might as well be cheap glass shard. ZERO color or interest. So disappointing.",Negative

Wanted to love these cute sheep stitch markers but pretty disappointed. The clasps in these stitch markers are flimsy. The one pictured here does not even close.,Negative
I like the product. I only used it maybe 3x because I had a hard time opening it because it was closed way too tight.  The last time I used it I dropped it on the floor and made a big mess. You may wanna think about repackaging it. ☹️,Negative
"Only comes with two screws and no anchors, this is not sufficient to attach it to the wall. Wood is very warped so won’t sit flush against the wall, stain was still wet so made a bit of a mess of the wall as we were trying to attach it",Negative
"This shirt is super soft but the color is horrible and the fit is strange- the neck is very high cut, circling the base of the neck rather than around the bottom like a typical round neck tee. The color is mustard yellow- a bright orange/yellow that is displeasing to the eye. I read the other reviews before purchasing and knew it would be bright- but not the mustard tone. I’m really disappointed and don’t plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. I ordered Belle Mickey ears to match and the colors are nothing alike.",Negative
It's look like a piece of trash It's ugly compared to what they show in the picture non sense TRASH TRASH TRASH I can't even read the name they write on it. SHAME ON THEM,Negative
"My son is learning to spell his name and thought it would be a great addition to the other puzzle names.  We had purchased for our oldest child.  This one doesn't even compare to the quality of our other wooden puzzle name boards.  It's super thin and lightweight, but the bright colors are pretty.",Negative
It has a coconut derivative in it that’s not listed in this ad for the item: cetearyl alcohol. I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.,Negative
like but the string closure dislike due to future broken .,Negative

This is just a picture on a paper. Might say it doesnt have a frame but I clearly missed it. Never would have paid for a picture I can print off the internet.,Negative
"I got these and they were going to go perfect in my son's spiderman room. I even waited a little bit to put them up because I had painted my sons room about a month prior and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause gas bubbles. So about another 3-4 weeks later I applied them. The application process was pretty straightforward and easy. They looked great on the wall. Then roughly 24hrs later, they started peeling off the wall! I tried to use the squeegee to reapply it, basically lifting the whole decal off the wall, then it started ripping as I was trying to reapply it. No matter how slow, or carefully I tried, each decal would rip in about 6+ spots. Now, 1/2 to 3/4 of each decal actually sticks to the wall and most of the bottoms are peeling off (and won't stick no matter how many times I try to get it to) and have numerous rips. Not what I was expecting at all, considering all the good reviews. Pretty disappointed, especially since these weren't cheap.<br /><br />Edit: added pictures. 1st picture showing all buildings is right after 1st time applying. Following pictures are about 24 hours later, peeling, and when gently trying to reapply they started ripping.",Negative
"We ordered 2 of these.  One came perfect, the other one showed up in 2 separate orders wells later and it didn’t have holes to put the legs into and after 2 months it developed a huge crack where the boards separated.  We don’t use it often so we didn’t notice, and now it’s too late to replace or return according to the seller.",Negative
"Exactly as another reviewer said.  Looks like someone (anyone) just pulled a jpg and stretched it to print on card stock.<br /><br />This doesn't even count as a photo or a ""print"".<br /><br />You could do the same thing for less than $1 by sending a internet jpg to Walmart to print.  Wasteful and feels very dishonest.",Negative
Cute but not worth the price,Negative
So thin you can see thru it. This would be better for ladies fashion then anything tactical. Ends where ready to split and not tied as a traditional one would be. Have used these in dessert and snow and would only use this to blow my nose.,Negative
"Beautiful in the nose, but the ends are so sharp that this caused damage to my healed piercing. I had to go to a professional piercer to have it cut out of my nose because the ends do not close properly.",Negative
"The chain is a very yellow gold and has no silver accents like the description states. The pendant is more of a warm gold, which doesn’t match, and looks cheap to me. I purchased this for a Birthday present and do not have time to find another gift or give the seller an opportunity to remake. Very disappointed.",Negative
"It's a  photo on photo paper, not what I thought I was getting.",Negative
"The hat came with a silver dollar sized yellow stain on the front of it, and a smaller stain on the other side.  :( it is too late to return and get a new one bc we leave tomorrow. Disappointed.",Negative
"Love turquoise earrings, but after opening the box I had to look twice to make sure I was seeing them. They are tinier than tiny and inappropriate for a youngster to wear, in my opinion, without the risk of being swallowed. I could think of no useful or safe purpose for them. Packaging was nice, but going back.",Negative
"So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one. Very disappointed not even with 1 star.",Negative
"Never ordering from this seller again. One of the trigger pieces is too big for the slot on the blaster and no amount of sanding could fix it. Also they do not provide specific instructions on their website, they have diagrams. It's not the same things. Save yourself the frustration and buy from somewhere else.",Negative
Garbage 🗑,Negative
"WOW! AND SPENDING MORE MONEY FOR A PUFF, THAT SHOULD HAVE COME WITH THE POWDER, THAT I THREW<br />OUT.<br />SORRY I ORDER EVERYDAY AND THIS WAS NOT A GOOD BUY. PUT THAT PUFF INTO THE POWER!! THAT'S HOW YOU DO GOOD BUSINESS!!!",Negative
"I didn't mind paying tax on a bootleg item or being charged $2.00 for shipping for a sticker that was simply mailed in a letter envelope with a regular stamp,<br />I do, however, mind the poor sticker paper...<br />...and worse, that this is not a printed reproduction... that would have been great.  The fonts are available online and it would have looked sharp properly printed.  The black and white would have looked great<br />Nope... this was the seller pulling a low quality image of the logo off the internet and printing it on a color copier.<br />The result... a slightly blurry image with grayish white fuzzy lettering on a washed out blackish background<br />buyer beware",Negative
Not like photos,Negative
It’s not the original scent if any scent at all. Not the original container with a puff. It’s just a cardboard container that contains powder that doesn’t have any scent. I was very disappointed.,Negative
In accurate description. Very tiny.,Negative
They are very small no way its wall art,Negative
"I wish I could give zero stars. Very disappointed. PAY ATTENTION TO THE DESCRIPTION. YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE OVER-PRICED RINGS. Picture on left is what I was expecting the stamped letters to look like. Picture on the right is what they actually look like. You can barely see it! The letters do not take up the whole space as the pictures would lead you to believe. Nor are the letters bold enough to be legible. Oh but according to the seller, they say all of this in the description: “letters so small you can only see them up close yourself”",Negative
"It's ok, I guess. I purchased another dictionary art print from another seller that is actually printed on a genuine vintage dictionary page. This one is not. It is a COPY of a print done on a dictionary page and printed on photo paper. The lack of authenticity is a disappointment. Just not the same.",Negative
"No sirvió para nada, se arrugó el material apenas se puso. Muy mala calidad, lo tuve q desechar.",Negative
[[VIDEOID:97c62ab6dba4fb835781e333ca664d09]] Not hperallergenic,Negative

"The Pyramid is a beautiful piece, I have it placed on my computer now. I am disappointed though because i was excited to have this but i noticed it was broken. The side is chipped.",Negative
"Cool concept, however the necklace looks a lot nicer online than in person. It also had a funny smell.",Negative
This collar is way to wide and big for my<br />Little pup,Negative
I order this fire my daughter’s nursery and I ordered an 18in for both names. This is no where near 18in. The writing looks just like the picture being advertised but besides that I don’t like it.,Negative
I love the lettering. However this transfer is do tiny.  I was disappointed.,Negative
"I originally bought this for my friend as a birthday gift, as we surprised him with a night out to the Lizzo concert. I was so excited, as I felt this would be a great way to remember the night.<br /><br />WRONG! The design was faulty, and the hole was too close to the top, so would not be able to hang beautifully from anything.<br /><br />After chatting with an Amazon rep, they shipped a replacement. I was expecting this to work, but nope! The second replacement had the same issue: the hole was ripped through the top, unable to hang from anything.<br /><br />Yet again, I chatted with a representative who SWORE this third time would be the charm. In case you couldn’t guess by the photo attached, the third had the same issue with the broken through hole.<br /><br />I’m SO disappointed.",Negative
"At the end of the day, it is probably my fault I am not happy with the results.  The lettering I received was not what was pictured and even though I ordered the large font it looks tiny and “delicate” on my mailbox.  I can’t read it from the car as I approach the house.  The ordering process was not clear and there isn’t a confirmation of size/color after you place the order.  In the description they offer to send you a mock up of some sort but I didn’t see that until after the product arrived.  If what you are looking for is what is pictured, be sure to contact the seller before it ships no matter what.  Otherwise you have no idea what you are getting.",Negative
"Based on the cost and the final product; in hindsight, I could have printed this myself and saved on cost.",Negative
The necklace wasn't sterling silver it changed color,Negative
"Está muy lindo pero de muy mala calidad, el gancho está como pelado. Muy decepcionante",Negative
Tarnished Returned,Negative
"The wood etching is very nice, but overall this journal is not worth $29.  The rest of the journal can't be worth more than $2.  If I could do it all over again, the max I would pay would be $12.  What I'm trying to say, apart from the wood, it's not high quality.",Negative
The rash on my daughter's neck from one day of wear. Hasn't even got it wet yet. She woke up crying and pointing to her neck. Silver color is coming off also. She's never had a reaction to other metals. This is obviously cheap material.,Negative
Soooo small can't see the initials engraved. I bought this as a Christmas give and was too embarrassed to give it to the person. I went by something else.,Negative
Can not read name on ring,Negative
"I received this necklace as a graduation gift from my best friend. Immediately I loved it! Its a super cute necklace and came packaged nicely. I have only wore my necklace for 3 days now, and the plating is flaking and peeling off. There is hardly any on the back and the sides, and its working towards the front. I am very disappointed that this has happened so soon after very minimal wear.",Negative
This would have been cute had it not been for the smudged ink and uneven pattern. I tried to fold it to make it even over my bed (king size) but as you can see in the photo it's uneven at the bottom.  Makes no sense to return. It will be replaced with a better quality tapestry.,Negative
"Product didn’t fit, came ripped, wasn’t accurate, couldn’t adjust, overall bad",Negative
Looks cheap. Very disappointed.,Negative
When I purchased this item I thought I was buying pictures that I could hang on the wall but when I opened the package they were just prints so you have to read everything I suppose because it is very misleading and I also bought another set which is very misleading,Negative
It was pretty but arrived broken 😩,Negative
I received an empty box with no earrings inside.,Negative
"Overall cute cutters, but very poorly printed had to remove a lot of excess plastic stringing left over by mediocre 3d print. overpriced for quality",Negative
Yard ornament,Negative
No es como te lo venden esta muy caro y no bien cómo en las fotos 👎👎👎,Negative
"I expected this to be a paper of what was popular in your birth year, like songs, politics, science, events, but it wasn’t. For $15 I thought it would be more. Very disappointed.",Negative
Bent all up when trying to put it in my nose. Took it out and couldn't even get it back to the way it was suppose to be..,Negative
"Have had this nose ring for less than a month and have only had it in for 12 days, and the silver is coming off so it now looks old! I wanted to love this nose ring but it’s frustrating that it looks years old now",Negative
"It is printed on good paper, but the size of the margins is much larger leading to much smaller boxes, so functionality is lost.",Negative
"This is the second ring I've bought from this seller.  I now have both of Claire's wedding bands from the show Outlander and I love them both 💜  They are both very well crafted and worth every penny.<br />UPDATE 02\17\21: I have to remove some stars from this ring, after really looking at it, this was not made by hand (as in NOT well crafted) at all, it must've been stamped by a machine because 2 out of the 3 pineapples aren't fully etched in nor are the others which I believe to be a leaf and feather maybe??  Really hard to tell.  I still wear it but wouldn't pay this much if I had seen it in person.  The other one, while not really looking like Claire's ring, is still very pretty.",Negative
"I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with. Please be careful and be aware of this when ordering your pendant.<br />I would order this again in a heartbeat if the cross coin was a bit larger and much heavier.",Negative
"Total waste of money, not worth it at all!!!",Negative
cheap die cut with rough edges.  not at all what i expected.  look super cheap.  huge waste of money,Negative
I like the everything besides the writing really small can't see it,Negative
The beads were dull in color.,Negative
Armband could not hold weight of phone and kept slipping down my arm,Negative
"So tiny, won't wear",Negative
"The design would be so cool if you could actually see it. The black printing is so close to the color of the gray shirt that someone will have to be right up on your chest to see what it is. Also, its either an irregular cut shirt or one of those reject ones you buy from the discount stores because it is way wider and shorter than a typical size large.",Negative
"Very soft, nice material, not very breathable. I bought this for my son and their ridiculous mask policy at school. You can still feel your hot breath all over your face.",Negative
These are a piece of paper that you could print yourself! It is advertised as a plaque but is a flimsy piece of paper. When we tried to return it is cost more than it was worth!! Make your own,Negative
This item was very cheaply made. It looked more impressive in the picture.,Negative
The letters on the mat started fading and wearing out quickly despite light use. As an outdoor mat it should have been made better.,Negative
"Glass shattered, almost cut my finger, soap melted and box is in shreds from the broken glass with whatever liquid. Terrible packaging and for the money not worth it.",Negative
"Very disappointed. The leather portion is only about 4"" long. The rest is a cheap chain. Save your money.",Negative
They are to soft,Negative
I bought this for a memory table for my graduation party.<br />It came missed up. It creases on it and bent.<br />Im very disappointed and upset.,Negative
This was so tiny and not wide enough to go Into your nose initially,Negative
Nice concept but the chain was a dark finish that didn’t match the metal of the charm,Negative
I love wishes. I love ornaments. ...but seriously?!?  $24 for a glass ornament with a few dandelion seeds in it?,Negative
Horrible product not true to size,Negative
Stone fell out.  Unable to wear now,Negative
"I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.",Negative
"This is an extremely shoddy product.  It's as if the seller bought a do-it-yourself magnet kit, proceeded to cut pictures from an old promotional pamphlet and put together a ""finished"" product.  The pictures are very poor quality and obviously not meant for the purpose.  I bought these as a gift and instead threw them away.",Negative
Dough gets stuck in crevicesno matter what I try,Negative
Coating came off almost immediately.,Negative
It's pretty but it's just a piece of paper.,Negative
The chain is stationary and the closure is right on the piercing. I agitated my ear so much trying to figure this out it bled.,Negative
"I am a big crafter so I’ve done items like this before, very cute, but very hard to put on evenly. Once I got it on, every night it bubbles up! Making me lose my mind. I would not recommend.",Negative
I purchased this ring for my granddaughters 18th birthday. She loved it! After a short time the band weakened. She is afraid to wear it fearing it may break. What can be done to repair ring?,Negative
This tie is not at all the color pictured and is very heavy because of the stones they use.,Negative
"The stone was dull in color and very cloudy. I did not expect it to be exquisite for the price, but I did expect more than what I got.",Negative
"The look and size was what I was looking for, but after only a day of wearing it my nose was swollen and tender and very uncomfortable, had to take it out immediately and I’ve had my nose pierced for 3 years.",Negative
Comes 8 inches larger than they specify,Negative
"Looked very cheap , decided not to even give it to the mom",Negative
"They came on pieces of Xerox paper, you can print these out at home yourself. Total waste of money.",Negative
I reported that these were not delivered to me. They said since it showed delivered basically oh well. This isn't ok and I will not order from them again. Beautiful work. Sad.,Negative
it's just the confetti at a high price (no poppers),Negative
Too impossible to put on.,Negative
It gave me a rash,Negative
"First of all, this came all the way from Turkey. The detail given to packaging and shipping, I would give 10 stars if I could.<br />The reason for 4 stars:  the knob to hold and pull the plate Feom needed to be a little bigger for gripping. I have used these in the past, but this one is more difficult to maneuver, especially hot.  It is also isnt glazed as others, so this one will retain flavors when cleaned.<br />The design otherwise is very pretty.<br />Update:  after cooking with them, we discovered that it ruined the taste of the food.  I think the solution is they need to glazed.",Negative
"This bracelet is not silver, so don’t advertise it as it is! Arrived a week late! Wow! Not happy at all. This bracelet is cheap quality! Wouldn’t buy from this seller again!",Negative
Seller hard to deal with !,Negative
"I loved the smell the first 10 minutes, then it became something entirely different than leather. I’ve used other leather scented waxes before.  This one was different.<br /><br />It takes forever to arrive.  The scent lasted less than 6 hours,<br /><br />I’m sorry to say that I won’t buy again.",Negative
Well. This is one of this product that looks great and then ...... anyway. I guess not bad for the price. 😅,Negative
Only had this item for 2 months and the belt clip has broken already!!!! Not happy!!,Negative

"Poorly made, arrived damaged and not as advertised.",Negative
"Not a good quality shirt much less screen printing. Fits very loose, and looks as if the screen print will fade quickly. The print looks very cheap. Would like to return, but they haven’t verified they would allow returns... Up your game, people!! What gives?",Negative
This item is much smaller than I expected. I won’t stay on even after I squeeze it on tight even to leave a bruise on my nose.,Negative
Looked stunning. It would keep moving around and was uncomfortable at first. After a week or so turned my nose green.,Negative
Make sure you check the size - this was not at all what I was expecting for the price.  It's the size of a regular sheet of paper.,Negative
For very thin note cards this was extremely expensive. I was expecting a much thicker more high quality card. They are very tiny. They are pretty but I would not order them again.,Negative
Charging more than $1 for this is an absolute joke.<br /><br />Its literally just a piece of printer paper with this graphic printed on it. Huge scam,Negative
"These euro shams looked pretty online, but once I received them and put them on my pillows the ruffles folded down and looked terrible displayed on my bed. I am returning them, they either have to be redesigned or show on line that the ruffles don't stay up. I would give them 3 stars but I'm giving them 2 or less because now I have to pay for shipping to return them. Not a good deal. I'll have to do my homework better next time.",Negative
They have totally lost their shape and are unwearable.,Negative
This is definitely thin and cheap. Irritated my piercing immediately. Not worth it at all,Negative
Too tight on my neck and not comfortable to wear.,Negative
I received the wrong item and it definitely was not even close to what I expected for the price. It looks  cheaply made and the color is coming off already. I had order the silver one and received the rose color.,Negative
"I purchased this as a Valentine’s Day gift for my daughter, I was very sad to see that the beads were broken during shipping. Poor quality. Definitely will be returning.",Negative
I only received 1 damaged table. And I paid for 2. I would highly advise staying away from this buyer.,Negative
This nose ring was so sharp to put in and horribly uncomfortable! Waste of money,Negative
Chain broke a week after we gave to my daughter,Negative
Pretty bad quality....I would not recommend this product.,Negative
They really don't hold up after 5 or so uses and washes.  The material is visibly worn down and stained despite washing with stain remover and bleach.,Negative
The fragrance is gone! Don’t bother buying!!,Negative
I thought I was buying a petite necklace charm. These are big and thick. Almost as big as a penny. Not returnable.,Negative
Broke after the first day. Got a replacement but still . Do not wear to sleep or pretty much while you are doing anything because it will break rt away,Negative
Came misshapen and off center. Waste of money,Negative
Cheap and didn’t come on time when I needed it,Negative
Bummer these are super cute but I ended up with a large bag of glittery silver Mickey heads and I ordered black/white. Hopefully they give a full refund including shipping so I can rebuy the correct colors again.,Negative
when I opened the package the radhesive package was cut completely in half which cut one of the marker adhesives,Negative
Not worth the money. $12 for an 8×10 photo sheet!,Negative

"Cheat piece of paper fglued to a cake pop stick, the mailed in an envelope which got bent.",Negative
"The screen print was not as advertised in the picture. It is way bigger and covers almost the entire front of the shirt. The quality of the shirt isn’t great either. For how much this cost, I was expecting way more. Truly disappointed.",Negative
This plate is extremely disappointing. I bought this for my mom who is a HUGE star wars fan. The picture is extremely misleading. It looks like a chrome cover with 3D features. It's a typical flat plastic piece which was broken upon opening. Easily the worst thing I've ever purchased on amazon.,Negative
"It's not AT ALL how it's was in the picture.  Completely disappointed. And 5 mins of my son wearing it, it broke. Un real...",Negative
Did not like the fact that it looked old and used.. had scratches on the front side,Negative
Very disappointed with purchase. very difficult to get in contact with seller. Seller printed name incorrectly and have been attempting two get this fixed. however it say no returns/exchanges. have been trying to get in contact yet no luck. This was the sellers error not mine.,Negative
Not at all what I ordered. It came small and I selected 24x30 option. It was not printed centered. Also it was supposed to be a canvas! Waste of $46. I could’ve printed this off of my computer myself.,Negative
The stones are pretty but it’s on an elastic string. It broke the first time I put it on.,Negative
I really thought this would be a poster but it is just photo paper. Love the joke but just disappointed.,Negative
Smells horrible! Yuck I put some of it in the litter box.,Negative
Complete waste of money product has barely any sand and doesn't smell anything like what it's advertised as,Negative
Pieces of junk!!! Too thin and tiny to even be placed in an infant’s ear!!! Like most Chinese product...NO GOOD!,Negative
I wore my necklace one time and the clasp broke. I did not do anything out of the ordinary simply went to open the clasp to take it off and it broke.,Negative
Beautiful nosering and reasonable shipping time. Two-star rating only because the stem of the nosering is way too short and doesn't poke all the way through the piercing. Sadly I'm unable to wear it.,Negative
"Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.",Negative
"Item says 18k gold vermeil, but it’s completely silver. Not happy.",Negative
No covers. Nice calendar otherwise,Negative
Don’t buy! Cheaply made. The chain broke on day 2. Not worth your money or return time.,Negative
17 bucks down the drain.. false advertisement this is the smallest ive ever purchased for this price the picture itself looks like a normal size but look how tiny this is not worth it,Negative
Not what I expected ... the names are hard to read as they are only stamped on the leather ... so all in all...everything blends in..<br />If the names where stamped in and maybe added a little ink to it to break up the peice it would make a difference ..,Negative
It was too small for my piercing,Negative
"This case is beautiful, but unfortunately isn’t good for protection. The initial case I ordered was broken and did not fit, which the company was happy to replace for me at no charge. Sadly, the replacement fit at first, but broke in the same spot not even two weeks into using it.",Negative
They tarnished almost immediately.,Negative
Gave me the wrong color and hasnt contacted me back be reminded I contacted not once but twice.,Negative
Way too small and the stud bent right away.,Negative
"The shirt and graphic quality are good, but beware that you don’t get to choose the color of the balloon dog. I thought it would be some solid color like all the examples but I ended up with a solid white one that I would never have chosen. I can’t return this so I’m going to try to color the balloon somehow.",Negative
Leaves black under my chin.  POOR QUALITY,Negative
Very bulky & too heavy that it doesn’t stay up right. Pulls down shirt too.,Negative
The crystal popped out of the earring within days. Not even a week. Very cheaply made and wasn’t worth my time and money.,Negative
Nothing it was pretty but I wasn’t satisfied because so wrinkled just tossed it ugh,Negative
Nice but expensive for what it really is.... a piece of sanded and stained wood with magnets.,Negative
"I purchased this bag a couple of weeks ago and first I was shipped the wrong color, a replacement was shipped out only after I had to send pictures of the wrong colored bag.  The correct color arrived and I loved it until about a week into use.  The leather on the handles started to flake off, when I contracted the maker, they stated that this was vintage leather and this was common and that I could send it back to be fixed, keep in mind I have only had the bag 2 weeks!  The logo on the bag has perfect leather(shocking)!  I love supporting small business but this bag is sadly not worth the money, the design and size are great but the quality is poor.",Negative
"This is false advertising.  This was meant to be a gift for someone that loves a YETI cup.  Maybe it's a great cup, but I didn't pay 47 bucks for a knock off.  Seperate your listing for makes and models.  Is it a Ford or a Tesla, surprise!",Negative
"Did not look like the picture, came with a dent on the side. The shape looks like a bloated heart.",Negative
Wrong color sent.  Okay craftsmanship at best. Would not purchase again.,Negative
Not happy the ring is not cornflower blue it is a lot darker hard to see the star. I had a ring stolen was trying to replace it. Not the same,Negative
I’ve enjoyed this bracelet but now I see it has tarnished and very disappointed in the quality,Negative
This product is so small compared to picture and the turquoise stones look like cheap plastic.  Very disappointing!,Negative
Kind of bigger than I expected dry wood,Negative
"My daughter order this sticker and was very disappointed (as was I) to the quality for the price. It's cute, but clearly a home craft on homeowner quality material.<br /><br />Really surprised to see this seller on Amazon and not a craft platform.",Negative
"UPDATED TO ADD PICTURES<br />After looking at my actual prints again, I have decided to update my scathing review; however, I STILL DO NOT like the prints.  I still think the resolution is terrible and the colors are runny compared to the posted picture on Amazon. These are not what I expected; however, maybe they will work for someone else. At any rate, I left some actual pictures of what I received below, so you can be the judge.",Negative
When taking the backing off the entire vinyl messed up.  And I've done vinyl decals many times with no problems.,Negative

"I'm a grandmother always trying to keep up with the times. I thought this dress was precious and it's not so much that everyone else didn't so much not like the dress itself and the cute ring of flowers (I bought it in white) BUT.....I BOUGHT THE YEAR ""FIVE"" and all I heard was how messed up the ""F"" looked and I had to agree with them!!!! It didn't look like an ""F"" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the ""F"" letter!! I also wish that they would of offered an add-on sale of under dress shorts so I didn't spend so much time hunting down some.....right color, size, price, etc.",Negative
It isn't what I expected because it's not good. The small tiny packet is more expensive than the other.,Negative
"kinda nice quality.  but, i am not a druggie.. this is a very psychedelic style pot.  i was just looking for something nice to put tea leaves in.",Negative
This ring is attractive; I like the design and color; but I will not be wearing it. The sharp edges snag my clothes. And the weight of the ring forces me to remove it for comfort. I found I could only wear it for a few minutes. So sad. Another tenant for my jewelry box.,Negative
No se percibe el olor,Negative
Cheaply made for price,Negative
"Although the earrings were very pretty, the lever part was for a child size ear.  I have many of lever back earring including some from Victorian era and the lever is not that small.  I could have made the change as I make jewelry, but paying for something you should not have to recontruct it.  Too bad.",Negative
Too small doesn’t even lay right,Negative
I can only say it’s very small and hard to put on,Negative
The item I received was not the item pictured. I notified the seller twice to return it exchange it for what was pictured and never received a response.,Negative
Terrible smaller then my pinky finger nail,Negative
Sorely disappointed! This just a leather match case. Basically multiple layers of ground up leather base synthetics and glue. Ages much faster the real leather and breaks at bends very quickly. This would have been a nice little bag if the craftsman had chosen better materials. For this price I could have gotten two canvas bags that would last much longer.,Negative
"Do not be deceived by this item!!  Almost $20 for a handful of confetti.  This is absolutely, absolutely ridiculous and a total SCAM.",Negative
Literally a printed photo paper,Negative
It’s a cheap laminate sticker on a cup. Total rip off,Negative
Sloppily made. One of the shelves is split significantly causing it to be nearly impossible to place anything on that shelf cause its small as it is and not functional with the split shelf. Looks rustic and cute but doesn't serve a purpose.,Negative
Thought that I was ordering something that I could use right away... Now I have to find frames to put these thin pieces of paper in... I'm sure they'll look great in my bathroom when I'm finished. Disappointed because they're still in the box.,Negative
On arrival--we were unable to tell what letter it was. I was so disappointed as it was intended as a birthday gift for my son. No one in the family could identify the letter.,Negative
There is a clear error in this print.  There is a random quotation mark at the end of the poem...but there is no opening quotation mark.,Negative
package was empty,Negative
"the Stone was very beautiful,  The setting actually bent when I tried to put on the erring.  I send back immediately.  Thin and bendable setting:(",Negative
"Very flimsy, cheap bag that doesn’t sit upright on its own. For the price it should have a sturdy bottom. The personalization is nice but I’m very disappointed in the bag quality. If it wasn’t personalized, I would send it back :/",Negative
I did not receive the lights I ordered. I understand the rustic look but to have a very visible black indentation in the upper right corner on one of the sconces is unacceptable and swayed me into thinking maybe this product is no longer a good fit for my decor. Please ensure Packers thoroughly check the product before shipping to customers.,Negative
"This would look very pretty, but I couldn't get it off the paper on the wall without it completely ripping. The company was nice enough to work with me and refund.",Negative
"This bracelet is NOT what the pic looks like. The pic must buy magnified 500 times! The ""stones"" look like they are made for a Baby bracelet!  I am very upset with this company and the way it was described  and pictured. Will never buy from there again!",Negative
Loose not fit with my airpod pro.,Negative
This lotus necklace is of very poor quality. Will be sending it back,Negative
"This glorified sticker did not stick. Not only that, it's impossible to remove from the paper it comes packaged on. It's flimsy and a waste. It was a scam and this product is a scan run by a fake company. I should have bought from a reliable company. This is my opinion, make you're own choice.",Negative
I already have very small wrist. I can wear kid size bracelets and even this looked too thin and small on me. The name engraved on it is so tiny!! Not even in proportion. Good to wear in a set and maybe a small msg just for you but not at all what I was expecting,Negative
No están bien hechos tienen de fectos de fábrica,Negative
Shirt stuff  Doesn’t wash well uncomfortable due to stiffness also has a smell that will not wash out of it,Negative
"This thing has this weird inner rubber gasket. It's so incredibly tight, that when you try to squeeze and jam the airpods in, the inner seal thing snags due to friction and drags it with it. Oh, and it's SO TIGHT you have to cut it off; it will not come out at all.<br /><br />Pretty convenient to say you can't do returns on personalized products when they don't fit and are crap. Easy way to scam and get rid of poorly made merchandise.",Negative
The item I received looked NOTHING like the item shown you think your purchasing. Sending this back to vendor.,Negative
After wearing this bracelet for 3 weeks the beads and string broke.,Negative
"Did not come in a frame. No big deal, but the print on this looks cheap and slightly evil with the snake heads! Don't think ill get a frame or put in my office....not worth the money at all.",Negative
Not good quality,Negative
Doesn't  work,Negative
"Turned dark within a week of wear, not sure if it's silver. My ears did not have a positive reaction",Negative
These are slightly bigger than 11x14 and will not fit in a frame unless you cut them down. Can you cut a straight line? Me either. Disappointing.,Negative
"The earrings caused an allergic reaction in my ears after wearing for 3 days. The earrings even tarnished in 3 days. After cleaning the pair (because I love the design and fit!) one earring remains ""pitted"". See picture. I bought these during the COVID lockdown but will wait until stores re-open to purchase personal items such as earrings. Expensive lesson learned.",Negative
"Stone fell out the third day, very disappointed",Negative
"Not sticky enough so peels at various points (on the plus side, it's easy to remove). Didn't quite fit Quest so first had to be trimmed and it just doesn't lay right on non-flat headset surface. I'll probably put two small googly eyes on instead (each with a small enough surface area to be<br />on a more or less flat part of the device).",Negative
"Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!",Negative
No stars. It was horrible.,Negative
"pretty, but no weight to these earrings, so don't work for me - donated to goodwill",Negative
Awful product. Tasted nothing like baja blast.,Negative
i threw the actual ring out cuz it snagged over and over again all day on my clothes. awesome stone though. keeping the stone in my wallet.,Negative
Get stained very easy and broke on the second time I was wearing it,Negative
Product was very cheap looking and made with poor quality.<br />Picture online is much better than the actual product.,Negative
Super cheap. Could have printed something better myself.,Negative
Size is off runs small,Negative
Waited 3 weeks to get this product was super excited. Because let's face it who doesn't want their house to smell like fruity pebbles?? Got it put it in my burner and waited for my house to smell amazing... I could only smell it when I got right over top of my burner. Super disappointed...Kroger wax melts are cheeper and smell better,Negative
It was beautiful but I wore it for 8 hours and it turned my finger green so not worth it to me,Negative
Shoes fit properly but the printing was stretched horizontally.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and asked for corrected sneakers but was just given the opportunity to return.  No option to get what I ordered....PLUS I had to pay shipping to return it.,Negative
"The print is cute. I ordered these for my identical twin boys that will be turning 2 soon. Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....",Negative
"This is absolutely NOT what is pictured.  What is pictured looks to be all metal with the shimmering disc in the middle, but it's not.  It's a metal pendant backing, but the rest is a sticker - the whole stargate and event horizon are a sticker.  If I could give 0 stars, I would.",Negative
Its not what i expected,Negative
"The ""birch"" is plywood.  (The quality of the set is like something you could find at your local Dollar Tree.)",Negative
I could have printed this myself on my printer using a higher quality paper and it would have been nicer and cost less than this.<br />Don’t waste your money.,Negative
I love the necklace but it broke the first day I wore it made me sad,Negative

"Beautiful bracelet , nicely engraved , fast shipping but turned my wrist green within a week and the bracelet changed colors as well within a week .",Negative
I ordered 21 LEFT and 33 RIGHT. They are not similar to the color guide image that she has. I was very disappointed. I am not at all a pink/purple kind of person and the 21 is definitely not blue as her image portrays. The 33 is not nearly as vibrant as her image. It’s more of a light lime shade. I contacted the seller and she basically said this is how it is. Very disappointing.,Negative
"I bought this as a gift for someone and kept good care of it in its box for a few months. After it was given, the ring started to show signs of heavy damage after only a few weeks, unlike the rest of the rings she wore. Definitely wouldn’t recommend",Negative

"I absolutely love Wedding Cake fragrance, but the Sunny Days fragrance was intolerable. Everyone’s taste is different, but I’ll stick to Wedding Cake!",Negative
"It smells like regular powder (no sandalwood), it's a small jar, it's expensive and they charge shipping - $28 for a small jar of regular powder - never again - buyer beware",Negative
By looking at the the description it says a 8 by 10 and as you see it’s not even a 5 by 7 not worth the money,Negative
"I immediately return item when I open it and seen these were cheaply, made with a enormous price......",Negative
"The print was nice and bright, but they shipped it folded in half!  The crease wouldn't come out, so I returned it.",Negative
"Extremely disappointing. Dough stuck (even with flour dusting), impressions were inferior, and the plastic parts warped in the top rack of my Bosch no-heating-element-dishwasher. One-time use; no desire to replace. A waste of money.",Negative
This decal would not peel away from the paper.  I tried is several spots and the paper came with it.  The directions were for a 3 price produce.  Mine was two piece.  The directions referenced spraying the decal with soapy water and I did so.  Decal still would not come off the paper.  Contacted seller and they were not helpful and generally insulting and rude.  If you have an issue they won’t help you or replace the product.  Try a different seller,Negative
Very cheaply made,Negative
first time put on bracelet wire broke and stones shattered all over the place,Negative
Beautiful but too small.,Negative
I thought the name will be engraved on the case but it is not. The name is just painted and gets removed easily.,Negative
These bracelets are very tiny and much smaller than the picture showwed.,Negative
The chain broke 2 weeks after purchase,Negative
Was not was I expected. Probably won't use.,Negative
I already send it back to the address they gave me wrong spelling the parents was not happy to thin I mail it out 7/21/22,Negative
"The actual conditioner bar is ok. Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste. But this thing was wrapped in 3! Layers of plastic in addition to the amazon packaging. The metal tin was in a plastic bag. Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!",Negative
Not happy with this product.  Too expensive for what you get.  I love all of my Amazon products I have ordered and I have ordered a lot.  But not [eased with this one at all.,Negative
The states first letter should be left off but it made me add it .,Negative
"Cheaply made, the hand fell off after 2 days",Negative
"These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.",Negative
"This product is not worth it,  very hard to take off paper and transfer to wall.",Negative
Fell apart when I went to put them on. Terrible material,Negative
Needed this necklace to be the color on the ad. It wasn’t,Negative
"This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.",Negative
I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.,Negative
This is just a piece of paper. Had to frame it like a picture.<br /><br />Thought this was wood or synthetic.,Negative
"The length is too small. Feels like a choker. Disappointed, threw it in the trash!",Negative
Looks cheap,Negative
"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter-in-law. The bracelet measured approximately 5"". I When I attempted to purchase the extension it would not allow me to purchase it as a standalone item. I contacted customer service multiple times and never heard back once. It is a beautiful little bracelet that will fit on a 10 year old",Negative
broke within 2 months. I had it fixed and chain broke again. Could that be it’s protecting or just poorly made!?,Negative
You can barely see the characters.  The moon is way bigger than Victor and Emely. Too expensive for the poorly quality.,Negative
Should have listened to all the one star ratings.  Stone is not real.  Disappointed.,Negative
"I liked the printed sign itself. The fact it is printed on thin, cheap cardboard is a minus. The stand that you are to insert or tap to display will not withstand moisture, wind for long so I can't  display until the day of. I tend to average 150 tweeters on Halloween  and am very concerned with this virus that kids, families, grandparents or us neighbors will be super spreaders of this virus. I appreciate the message of this sign and hope and pray we won't  need it ever again!",Negative
Definitely haven’t had it a week and already chipping fading and showing discoloration.. always remember people you get what you pay for !,Negative
The idea is great BUT when you leave on the mail box for a pick up and it rains ..... it rusts and is eventually<br />unreadable. It only took two rains to start the rusting.<br />Good idea but should have been tested first!,Negative
Very very tiny,Negative
tried to use the activator.  it worked great for a day..... then it dried out.  tried to look up different ways to get it back to useful.  it sucked,Negative
"I really didn't really like it, I thought the name was going to be on top where you can see WONT RECOMMEND",Negative
Bont like smell it to greasy for me,Negative
Not happy  with  product.,Negative
Came broken,Negative
"I just got this today and it's a very nice bracelet. However, they sent the wrong size! I ordered the Small 8.75 inches, but they sent me the Medium 9.25 inches. So, now I'll have to send it back for a replacement. What a pain! Still very nicely made and with quality leather. Hopefully, they'll send the correct size soon.",Negative
"It seems very cheaply made, it is just a sticker that is placed on a thin cheap cup. I didnt realize that....",Negative
Broken within 48 hours???????,Negative
I tried. My boyfriend tried. All we succeeded in doing was bending the pin in the adjustment tool. $34.99 down the drain......,Negative
This looked so pretty and I wanted to enjoy it but the edges were sharp and not smoothed down. The twisted pattern was also very pretty but very uncomfortable.,Negative
Got broken,Negative
The colors were no where near as vibrant as it shows in the photo. For the price I was really disappointed and felt like I could have made this print myself.,Negative
This is a nice looking bracelet. The problem with it is that it is perfectly round and has a lot of room between the bracelet and the arm. It looks ridiculous when your arm is resting on something because the bracelet is pushed up from underneath which leaves the part on top of the wrist standing way up above the wrist. I don't like wearing it at all and neither does my niece. I do not recommend this bracelet.,Negative
These look like they were generated from a home computer printer. The words and date are tiny and illegible.,Negative
Incorrect spelling.,Negative
"I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.",Negative
Very low quality.  We returned it because this looked cheesy.,Negative
makes me sweat more than other mask but if there is wind blowing then it feels good,Negative
I would have given a great review.  The earrings are stylish and light. When I took them out to wear them yesterday the wood broke right around the post. Apparently the quality is not very good if they are going to break within 4 months. I am not hard on earrings and have earrings that I have owned 20+ years. Do not reccomend buying these,Negative
"I only gave it 1 star because I had to. For approx. $50.00 this ""metal"" bracelet can break into any second while wearing it.  I will be returning it.  The personalization on it, cant even be read. I had a tribute of my father on the inside, NOT READABLE!! DISHEARTENING!!",Negative
Arrived late and damaged,Negative
"Not what I expected.  Not worth the price.  Unable to use this item.  Disappointed with this purchase.  I should have drawn this and printed it on my own photo paper for a lot less money.  Could have purchased 2 packs of photo printer paper for this price.  I guess if you really want to spend more money matting and framing these they would be alright, but it's not worth it to me - I'll probably just use them in a scrap book or something.",Negative
Extremely thin flimsy leather.,Negative
"Extremely fast shipping. However, the plastic used is very thin and has started to tear.",Negative
it was too small,Negative
Delivery was delayed over a week and once I received the product I started using it. Twice a day for over a week and a half with no change. Really a waste of money.,Negative
The stone I got was definitely not ruby and looked more like amethyst. Also the pendant looked tarnished. Not satisfied. Would not recommend. Will definitely be returning.,Negative
Not as good quality as expected.,Negative
Was not happy the band shown was white with black letters but I got all white can’t even see the letters,Negative
It definitely needs to be framed. I had to spend extra money to do it myself.,Negative
"No me agrado, no ura su color a pesar de los cuidados",Negative
Needs different hooks to hold charms on. Loved the bracelet because I love my Chi,Negative
I wear it for 1 week and after that metal on earrings changes color to rust. It is NOT a real silver and definitely not a rhodium finish. Not worth buying.,Negative
It looks like I've had this for years.,Negative
"Woww...what a RIP-OFF!!!  Paid over $20 for a small piece of flat cardboard with a design on one side!  I was under the impression that this ornament was 3-D and made of quality material!  Vendor needs to be more specific in their listing! Waste of my time and theirs, as I'll be sending it back!  THE ORNAMENT SHOULD COST NO MORE THAN A COUPLE DOLLARS!!!!",Negative
Just OK for the money,Negative
Too strong to use had to mix it up to not waste it,Negative
Came shattered,Negative
"For the cost,Need more scent",Negative
"I never bother to review products, but this one deserves it. It smells like… something. Kind of “foresty” I guess, but nothing like Balsam firs, or any typical Christmas tree scent. I’m not sure how anyone can think that it does, but it’s certainly suspicious that this is an Amazon sponsored product, which should have been a major red flag.",Negative
No,Negative
12.99 for an 8x10 picture is ridiculous,Negative
not what I was expecting for what I payed for just want a full refund or to return it,Negative
This product was a absolute disappointment and waste of money the decal looked good but was impossible to install because the decal would not peel off to apply it. To sum it up don’t be like me and waste your money,Negative
Really cheaply made and breaks easily,Negative
"A very cute bag...I gave it to my sister for her new teaching bag...but the handles stiching started to come apart and the bag actually split on the bottom. Looks cute, but not sturdy enough for a laptop or heavy items. : (",Negative
This product is so small very cheap quality not worth anything I have to choose a star otherwise I wouldn’t,Negative
This was a photo copied piece of paper. Don't waste your time or money on it!,Negative
It was very pretty. I really liked it but it broke at the clasp after one week.,Negative
It broke after i tried putting it on for the first time.,Negative
"The notebook quality was fine, but it did not conform to stated dimensions.  I tried contacting Galen Leather several times but never got a response.",Negative
So disappointed that this towel was made out of microfiber or at least feels like it. I hate the feeling on my hands. Someone else pointed out that it is also printed on one half of the towel so that you have to fold the towel in half to display.,Negative
"Smell didn't fill the room, not even a big room. A wax melt did better. And no I don't have covid, I can smell things.",Negative
"The legs became warped after a week. Not sure what to do, but was lead to buy because of reviews I read. Be weary before buying, maybe I just got a bad one 🤷🏼‍♂️",Negative
Just a poster had to then purchase a frame that fits it. Love the idea just not worth the price….,Negative
This product looks good in the advertising but is cheap and poor quality. Total bust!,Negative
"Don’t waste your money on this crap. It’s extremely cheap & awful to try to attach. I was ripped off, big time. It’s worth about $.05 at best.",Negative
"Didn't come with an instruction, by the time I figured out how it's done 2 letters were already torn. I ended up throwing the whole thing;  I regret buying this.",Negative
"So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, ""We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued."" Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.",Negative
The size was perfect but mine got deformed,Negative
"The concept for the bracelet is so cute, but the positive ends there. I thought the world be a great addition to my alex and Ani collection.<br />The fit is poor and the charms are too light weight and not of good quality. This might be cute to give to a child but I don’t think it is good for an adult. I love the wizard of oz, as it is to late to return I will have to find someone to give it to.",Negative
"Looks cool with the lights sitting on the shelf. Sadly, both the Jedi and Sith versions are so delicate that our home heater was slightly blowing on them and now they are tilted and warped. Too expensive. Too cheaply made. Only lasted 5-6 months.",Negative
Looks nothing like the picture when you receive it. Do not waste your money. Sign is much smaller than the picture. The color and letters are much much smaller than what they are advertising.,Negative
Was pretty disappointed with the quality. The gold lettering was already rubbed off on part of the keychain when I received it. Does not look very nice at all but the keychain itself seems to be okay quality. Was hoping to give this as a gift but it just looks like it’s already been used due to the wear.,Negative
No holes on the backs. Good luck hanging them.,Negative
Disappointing!,Negative
Its the size of a pea.,Negative
"I love the shiny brass of the tag since so many tags are all silver which made me happy to find a ""gold"" one. HOWEVER, I WISH the seller would include the entire alphabet in each font (upper and lower case) so that we'd be able to pick the right font when spending so much money on a specially made tag.<br /><br />Showing us examples of the fonts with 3 letter names like Max or even a longer name like Bella however those examples don't help any of us with dogs that have longer/different names or help us decide if we want the tag in all uppercase or a mix.<br /><br />I wish that the seller would either show us the entire alphabet of fonts OR make it so we'd get an actual previews of what the tag would look like in each font BEFORE ordering that way we get exactly what we want especially for these tags that cost pretty much the same as the ones in the pet stores do that actually show you exactly what you're getting.<br /><br />I would have never ordered this tag in this font if they would have shown the different fonts completely and clearly. Very disappointed with the tag but I can't return it so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />I ordered a different tag from this seller that came out beautiful so I know they have decent fonts/tags but this one is definitely a miss for me... a ~$14 mistake.",Negative
"For the price, I was disappointed that the lettering was not spaced evenly.",Negative
Decal does not transfer to windows well. Followed the instructions and still not working. I’m very disappointed.,Negative
Omg..all stuck together and couldn’t even use them. Cost more to ship back than worth it.,Negative
Very bad material. I bought those shoes in December and after wearing one week the toes were peeled off. Very bad material and when I tried to return they took the money of the total amount. Beware guys.,Negative
It definitely needs to be framed. I had to spend extra money to do it myself.,Negative

In American sizes I wear either L or XL, in Asian im a size 5XL OR 6XL if I can even get stuff that size. Thses gloves are medium sized American hands and XS on the forearms. Asians should make larger American sizes if going to sell garments over here.",Negative
The paint was not dry when placed inside the cardboard casing. It was a destroyed mess. This is (or was) the guest book for my wedding which is in 2 weeks.

I thought this was a mirror. The price was outrageous for a sticker,Negative
Did not have a powerful scent very disappointed,Negative

"First of all this ring took SO LONG to come. Secondly, it's FAKE!!! I'm so dissapointed, I was looking forward to this ring because the design and supposed stone is gorgeous.  There's no way it is a real stone, feels like plastic, and the metal feels cheap. Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon. But then I go to ship ot and it was going to be over $190 for this $25 fake ring can be shipped back to India.

I received this for my birthday! I liked it so much that I wanted to gift one to a friend as well for her birthday. I went to look only to find that my box had missing items.

"I can say that some of this was in me for not looking VERY closely at size, but I was a little disappointed when this arrived and it was an 8x10 photo. I was wanting something more poster size. If you look at the description closely, it does say 8x10, but I wish that there was an option to select specific size and corresponding price at check out so it would have been more obvious what size this was. Since I was searching for posters, I didn’t expect something this size to be described as a poster, but I guess its a lesson to check the details of an item very closely before you order.",Negative

"BEWARE: this is NOT the correct nose piercing gauge. 24 gauge is way too thin; standard is 20 gauge. Thin jewelry, especially when curved, can cause the ""cheese cutter"" effect. I'll admit though, I LOVED the way it looked on my nose initially.",Negative
This ring is so tiny. I needed a magnifying glass to see which way the name was. Not at all worth the money. I would not buy it again.,Negative
"I don't have a photo because I haven't purchased it yet.  After reading all the care instructions of ""keep away from body lotion"", ""keep away from humidity"", ""clean after each wearing"", and ""store in a plastic bag"", I'm turned away from buying.  I live in Florida, I wear body lotion, and I don't divide my jewelry in plastic bags.",Negative
Too small and it should have said the size but it didn’t.,Negative
"These were too big THEY POKED MY NECK and the quality was very poor they looked like cheap plastic.<br />To top it all off, THE RETURN PROCESS WASN'T CLEAR AND WAS RIDICULOUS TO RETURN THESE LIGHTWEIGHT EARRINGS BACK TO THE COMPANY FOR MY RETURN. I HAD TO PAY ALMOST $16.00 IN POSTAGE TO RETURN THESE EARRINGS!!<br />I'M DISABLED AND AT HIGH RISK WAITING IN LINE WAS NOT SAFE AND VERY PAINFUL I'M USE TO JUST DROPPING THE PRE-PAID PACKAGE OFF.

Crap you get what you pay for,Negative
This is absolutely not worth the money. It does not fit in a 9 x 11 frame because it cuts off the print also it is a piece of photo copy paper print it out I was very disappointed,Negative
This was a very cheaply made product. Don’t waste your money. They took a cheap case and slapped my name on it. I haven’t even opened it. Not going to use.,Negative
"I received this hook and didn't hate it. It was smaller than I expected. Perhaps I didn't pay attention to the dimensions... totally my fault. I wanted a hook like this for something particular but I needed it to be bigger. So after some thought, I decided to return it. When I tried to return it, suddenly I was going to get less than 50% refunded to me. Okay... I'll keep it but that really stinks when seller's do that and I'm annoyed. Won't buy from the seller again.",Negative
Not as nice as it looked ...,Negative

I asked my son and mother what it said before telling them and they couldn’t even make out my name! It is a bunch of squiggles. Nothing more. I can’t believe I wasted my money on this!!!! It is going to cost more to return it than what I paid for it. Scammed again!!!!,Negative
"I guess I didn't read the description of this product. All it contains is a bit of sawdust. Pretty lame. For some reason I thought there would be actual glitter (which is also quite goofy) but has been &#34;trending&#34; for bearded men. I purchased 2 pouches for my adult, bearded sons. I could have easily created the product. I am not impressed",Negative

Nice design but very small and it doesn’t get used.,Negative
"I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters ""machine engraved"". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.",Negative
"The chain broke immediately after my first use. I rotated the necklace so I could undo the clasp, and it snapped! Bummer.",Negative

Love it but it came with scratches on it. For this price it should be perfect. Very disappointed in that! Top left area,Negative
"Thought it would be printed on sturdier cardboard or something other then flimsy paper for the price. Ended up returning wasn't worth pay for a frame, although the picture itself is really pretty on computer.",Negative
Very little aroma,Negative

"I love the size, but it’s now all tarnished and looks off. Not very pretty. Not worth the money",Negative
I was in a rush for a gift and didn't read the reviews as I usually do. I'm so disappointed in these earrings. They are completely made of plastic! Twenty dollars for trash. And the packaging was just as bad!,Negative
Latch does not stay closed.,Negative
This item looks cheap. Turns out it is made in China.,Negative

No frames,Negative

Such a wast of money. This is the smallest flimsiest metal that you can tell they just snipped from a spool of long wire and made circular. Don’t wast your money.,Negative
"Gems are sort of randomly placed and the bow only has one tail piece. The blue gems are royal blue, while the bow is navy.<br />I selected for the gems to match the bow.<br />Eh. It’s ok. Not going to return.",Negative
I bought this product and it’s brake easy. I bought like 6 and all of them broke. I don’t recommend that to anyone.,Negative
"I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.",Negative
 ,Negative
I hate it!!!!!,Negative
"I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.",Negative
"I’m definitely going to be returning this.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks and feels super cheap, like $10 cheap. I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for. BUT, I had the bracelet personalized and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is UPSIDE DOWN. The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.",Negative
The only problem is i couldn't return it when i ended up not needing it,Negative
Nothing like the photo. Very small.,Negative
package was empty,Negative
"Doesn’t work with anything else, notebooks are a not useful.",Negative
Brakes quickly,Negative
Extremely disappointed.  This is a photocopy for 10.00. Of course its my fault for not reading the description fully but it did say distressed wood sign...anyone with a printer could have done this.  I take the blame for not reading carefully.,Negative
"I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.",Negative
Lines running through Charlie Browns head. Poor quality.,Negative
Could barely see the writing,Negative
Cheaply made. Cannot even read the engraving unless you hold it under a light. Definitely would not recommend this for a nice gift for someone as the quality is underwhelming.,Negative
"probably should be a little more clear about the fact that there is no filling in the ""quilt"".",Negative
"I have other line art that is awesome. This picture is NOT. It looks so amateurish like it was drawn with a thick magic marker. So I returned it and bought the ""pinky swear"" art piece from another source. So happy with the new one.",Negative
"Nice, but for the price I would expect better quality not just a picture on photo paper",Negative
"I kind of feel mislead by this seller, the description says it is 10"" long, upon arrival found the ""Real length"" to be 8"" with a flimsy 2"" chain  extension added to the end. NOTHING in the photo's or description mentions this. Very obvious misrepresentation of what you pay for, which is also quite pricey for what you get....if it was the size advertised I would consider it a good buy, but being 2"" shorter than shown I wouldn't waste your money.",Negative
These will only show up on dark-skinned people. They are very pale and don't show up on light-skinned people. Also they can't get wet and are very cheap and lightweight plastic.,Negative
No es oro solo pintada color oro,Negative

By far the worst phone case ever bough!! the craftsmanship is horrible please be aware of the product before you buy!!!,Negative
"The bracelet itself is nice but the packaging is very generic and there is no card or written information on the stones. It would have been nice if that could have been included, or at least something downloadable so I could print it out myself.",Negative
"Item was loose in the packaging, names were smaller than I thought they would be.",Negative
The colors are nice and the bracelet is great until it comes to the black rope that ties the anklet together. It looks like a large black spider and it's so thick that you feel it in shoes.,Negative
This nose ring it hardly adjustable and was gigantic,Negative
"As I went to put on this brand new necklace, the clasp broke entirely off the chain. It is pretty, but to break so soon is disappointing.",Negative

"La talla es súper pequeña, he comprado otros anillos de la misma talla y me quedaron super bien. Este no me queda 😭",Negative

I thought that it had  adhesive backing,Negative
"I have never given such bad ratings but guess there is always a first time to everything. I am struggling to find things that is good about the nail paints. They are one of the most streakiest, thick, and aweful to layer nail polishes I have every worn in my life.. save your money.",Negative
"This is suppose to be a natural stone bracelet. I gifted this to my husband Christmas morning, by the evening he said hunny this may be too tight, due to the color on his wrist. My daughter then put it on and the same thing happened to her. A natural stone is not dyed. This is false description if the item being sold.",Negative
Arrived bent and the plastic wrap was ripped,Negative

"The seller did not have a photo of Michigan on her site. So when I got it, its way smaller than I thought and the word is separate between the upper and lower peninsula and I am not sure if I had seen the sample, I would have bought it.",Negative
Extremely thin and flimsy item will not stay put. The slightest touch and its gone. I would call it disposable.,Negative
CardStock print for $10.00.  overpriced for poor quality - sending back,Negative
Cheap materials used. I think it’s rubber.,Negative
"The only plus is the it came fully assembled.  Table is VERY unstable and tips easily.  Be careful what you place on it because it may tip.  Also, the nail holes are visible ALL OVER the table - they didn't even attempt to cover or paint over them, so it looks very poorly put together.  After I received it, I went back and looked at the pictures online and those also showed all of the nail holes. I wish I had looked more closely at the pictures and reviews before buying  ALOT of money for something so poorly put together.  Will not buy from this seller again.  I'm afraid I'm stuck with it after reading other reviews.",Negative
The bracelet has no purple color of amethyst at all.  A cheap looking silver dangling clasp which is not displayed  with thread showing through  appears to be holding these so called real stones together. Very disappointing and will return. Just received 10 minutes ago.,Negative
"I used this maybe 4 times, and it started fraying apart. This is cheaply made, not safe at all. The material is very flimsy and thin. I do not recommend this at all, it can definitely seriously injure someone if they don't check their tack every time they ride.",Negative
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!<br />One doesn't even match the other!!!<br />SO ANGRY WITH THIS PURCHASE,Negative

They were smaller than a dime.<br />Cheap metal.,Negative
This review is for the product not the seller.<br />The colors were not vibrant. A California poppy should be orange. I received brown colored poppies. The seller did refund my money.,Negative
Screws loose on delivery I tightened them and added some do to there only being 2 in it.,Negative
"Don’t buy the organizer you can get it for $2.40 from amazon. I thought the organizer they are selling was big enough to go the width of the bag so I bought it. I should have read the details a little better. It (the organizer) is REALLY small, books will not fit in it. (Especially not any of my nursing books!) When I got the bag the monogram already had a couple pulls in the thread in my first initial, not super noticeable, I just hope it doesn’t unravel. Personally just not what I was hoping for to use during nursing school.",Negative
"Not worth any price. Firstly, 21oz size is an outright lie. Without ice it holds under 12ozs. Handle is made of plastic and poorly attached. ""Personalization"" is a sticker that will quickly be destroyed by any moisture. Garbage.",Negative
Very disappointed. Stick sign is attached to was snapped in half and actual “oh baby” is bent.,Negative
I loved my necklace and I was always careful I used it for a month or so and it broke 😫. I don't have the heart to trow it away.,Negative
Not what I expected at all!,Negative
Missing stone and I haven’t even worn it yet,Negative
"This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.",Negative
Cheap product. Had to bend open to put it in and then bend back once in like a bubble gum machine ring from when you were a kid. Did not fit snug.,Negative
"1 star so I could write a review. Before extender its 12""... looks like several left over items put together, some people do any thing to make money..<br />Do not purchase",Negative
Texas Independence was in 1836. True Texans appreciate accuracy in their history and do not care at all about when their Republic entered the union.,Negative
Bow doesn't come as pictured. The band was a pantyhose-like wrap. The bow and heart on the shirt is two different colors.,Negative
"Love the look of this and while it does seem easy to install, it didn’t work out very well. The “L” didn’t stick down to the morrow well so when pulling up the backing it shifted. It now looks like a lower case “b”",Negative
I received an empty envelope so I applied for a refund but they wanted me to return the product. I told them I didn't receive anything so they sent me the replacement and have now charged me twice. It was a great card but not that great.,Negative
"Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.",Negative
"Very uncomfortable very hard to keep in place, I would not recommend",Negative
This is not decoration or signage. It’s literally a print…a print on magazine quality backing. I feel dumb.,Negative
"These address stickers were stuck to the backing to the point that they wouldn’t come loose and adhere to the metal mailbox. I ended up tearing them up trying to get them to work. It was as if there wasn’t any glue on the address labels themselves.<br />The design was beautiful, but it doesn’t matter how pretty they are if they are in the bottom of your trash can.",Negative
nothing like photograph  not live edge. poorly made rectangle of cheap thin wood. do not purchase,Negative
Did not work as promised. I have used on two sores with no effect. Waste of money for me,Negative
"The flag colors were faded blue and a pinkish orange red. Not traditional flag coloring at all, very disrespectful to all those who serve.  Advertised as vibrant red white and blue. The personalization was correct but the shadowing and lettering were not good. This was for our son’s party for leaving for Basic Training. Very disappointed with not enough time to find a replacement.",Negative
Not only is quality very poor but the plastic posts bend easily and are difficult to get into ear.,Negative

"My son is learning to spell his name and thought it would be a great addition to the other puzzle names.  We had purchased for our oldest child.  This one doesn't even compare to the quality of our other wooden puzzle name boards.  It's super thin and lightweight, but the bright colors are pretty.",Negative
"For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.",Negative
"I have several rings from this seller, but was disappointed with this one.  It tarnished and did not come clean. The setting on the side was irregular as well.  NO issues with the others though.",Negative

Both ends cracked as I tried to stretch it out enough to fit into my nostril . Very thin metal . Cheap quality. Not worth $16 at all . I wouldn’t recommend buying it,Negative
Let the buyer beware! This purse is NOT the size stated in the description. The one I received was 9 inches wide by 7 1/2 inches tall (about 23 cm by 19 cm). The size described was 10 inches (25 cm) by 14 inches (35 cm). So I was expecting a larger size purse than this.<br />Other than that it is a pretty purse.<br />Please adjust your description of this item!,Negative

"We bought this custom made for my daughter's wedding back in April. I checked it when it arrived and it everything looked fine. The day before the wedding, we took it out of the packaging to have it ready for the wedding cake and the heart that hangs from the fishing pole had broken off at the fishing pole. We had kept it in the packaging that it had been shipped in and were gentle with it. It's absolutely adorable, but the material is not the best quality and is very fragile and frankly flimsy! If time wasn't of the essence and if it wasn't for such an important occasion I would say go for it, but if a friend asked me about the product I would tell them not to take the chance!",Negative

"I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.",Negative

I wanted to love thos but the pendant falls off fast! Haven’t had mine for a month and it broke off and is gone! Im so upset about that! The chain it comes on isn't good at all.,Negative
Looks and feel like plastic earrings.,Negative
"This product did not come with lights as advertised, nor a square base.",Negative
The candles smell pretty good. A bit disappointed as the smell doesn't last that long. Yankee candle has a longer lasting smell then ChicWick. For thr price i thought these were a little expensive. The one pro was the customer service people were very sweet.,Negative
Ordered for my son. He was excited..me not so much. But he loves this kinda stuff. Y'all nailed the smell😬,Negative
Very short,Negative
"Very disappointing, moldy wood crooked hooks and it’s a one coat paint job. Distressing is usually a few coats for brilliance. Pricey for wat u actually get.",Negative
For the price I could’ve done myself. Came in another box that looks like it was damaged so the folder it came in was bent and so were the prints. Waste of money.,Negative
"This wreath was much smaller than I thought it would be and the fragrance was strong…and not all that pleasant. Plus, it cost over $9 to return. I won’t be purchasing from this seller again.",Negative
"These were perfect and cute for about 4 hrs, until I decided to just change my shirt. Immediately got caught on the earring, ripped it out of my ear and bent the earring beyond the point of being able to bend it back into shape. Complete waste of money. If you so much as bend this somewhat the wrong way, you simply cannot get it back into a circle and it’s garbage. Shame.",Negative
"This was a bad deal and they refused to refund my money. Does this say Sye or Sue?<br />Cheap Workmanship , don’t waste your money.",Negative
This products red color was not received as advertised. Therefore making it useless for my purpose and unable to use.  The brim of the hat was distorted.  The box was small in comparison to hat size and arrived later than indicated.  For the poor quality of product the hat was over priced.  Sending back and would not order again.,Negative
Horrible!! They had no rubbery side so it didn't stay up at all once I moved...The ones I ordered from iheartraves off Amazon worked great tho!,Negative
So this would’ve been super cute but the second I took it out the package I knew it was too big for my nose. So I requested an exchange for a smaller size…. But it got denied?????? Interesting. Guess I’ll never know,Negative
The size,Negative
I don't believe this is real stone. You can clearly see the lines from fusing the beads together. Not worth the money.,Negative
"We bought lavendar sage, and loved the scent.  Problem was that on reheat there was not much fragrance put out into room.  I would be interested in how long or how many times the melt was intended to be used.  The past brand we used was a many reheat process.",Negative
It's too small and won't fit on the dock.,Negative
They seem like such a fun idea. The size and color of the writing and the font can make them very hard to read.,Negative

Cheaply done. Will not refund me.  I could make these with some fabric.  Do not order,Negative
Cheap looking could have made myself,Negative
"This necklace is beautiful and very dainty.  This is the 3rd one I've bought.  As careful as I've been with them, each chain has broken within weeks of purchasing them.  I kept seeing reviews recommending a stronger chain so I was hoping each time I bought another one that maybe they had used a stronger chain, but unfortunately, they have not.  As pretty as this is, I wouldn't recommend it.",Negative

"I selected number 13 “Andrea font” it didn’t turn out quite how I expected it to, I wish the seller offered a link to type the name and see a preview of how your plaque would actually look. I ended up using it because I didn’t have time to order something else, I wanted to keep it as a keep sale for my sons first birthday but when I went to pick it up off the cake (where it was gently laying against the top tier) it broke in half so I ended up just throwing it away. What a bummer.",Negative

Its very very hard to open and close ring hoop. Gold usually bends easily so not sure if its gold really. It’s pretty but very expensive and didn’t come with any gold certificate.,Negative
This thing hurt my nose so bad. I have surgical steel nose rings and others I’ve bought on Amazon. None of them hurt me. This one left a line on my nose and it was sore sore for at least a week after I took it out.,Negative

I followed the directions to a T. The backing would NOT come off of the skinny letters without help and would not come off of the colon dots AT ALL! I am extremely upset and disappointed! I waited way longer than was stated for the package and after all that waiting- I wasted an hour prepping and slowly peeling for NOTHING!,Negative
The letters on mine were cut off on sides,Negative

The sticky part kept some letters so i had to cut and tape them onti the mailbox.,Negative
"First of all this ring took SO LONG to come. Secondly, it's FAKE!!! I'm so dissapointed, I was looking forward to this ring because the design and supposed stone is gorgeous.  There's no way it is a real stone, feels like plastic, and the metal feels cheap. Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon. But then I go to ship ot and it was going to be over $190 for this $25 fake ring can be shipped back to India. Buyer be warned ⚠️!! Such a horrible experience.",Negative
"I love the look of this shirt!  However, the vinyl used is very cheap....feels ""crunchy"" to touch and I really don't believe it will last through the baseball season.  Not sure why they chose this vinyl...my friend ordered this shirt last year from the same vendor and hers is not like this.  Very disappointed.",Negative
Very disappointed. Very small -couldn’t be worn by an adult.,Negative

I ordered the Mr and Mrs set per the image. However only the Mr passport arrived. I contacted the Seller who indicated I ordered only Mr which isn’t correct.,Negative
"Thought these were going to amazing when I purchased them from the looks of the photos. Once they arrived I found they were stiff as a board, more like stalks of hay. After they were professionally installed, I went to sleep that night and woke SEVERAL times with scalp numb from how hard these are. Took them out after 3 days and bought some AMAZING soft wool dreads on ETSY. WASTED my money on these though. Shame...",Negative

"It is just a cardboard cutout, not even printed on both sides.",Negative
This is NOT printed on real dictionary paper. This is a digital image (jpg or pdf) of dictionary paper printed as an 8x10 photo on photo paper.,Negative

A friend of ours had put this on their wedding registry site not knowing that all it was was four pictures not framed not hangable but just pictures so it’s not very gift able by it self but we put it in frames and gave it to them for their wedding and they liked it .,Negative

I’m totally disappointed in this bracelet because it changed colour and turned my baby hand green.,Negative
Tarnished a week after wearing and engraving was cute but so tiny with lots of space left that could have been used.,Negative
"The only real things about this choker are the metal spacers. Everything else was created through a mold that plastic was poured into, including the arrowhead. Essentially, the manufacturer made an ""expensive"" piece of costume jewelry.",Negative
Won't stay on the clasp comes off a lot,Negative
No,Negative
i wear glasses and they fog terrible which means you can drive a truck through my mask. Limited protection I would think.,Negative
"These glasses do not look like the picture. They are clunky and the stones are not delicate, they're huge and gaudy. They're unusable for work conference calls. Debating returning them as they want me to pay for postage.",Negative

"We bought these in November for Christmas gifts. The adult size didn’t fit our daughter, but we did not know that until after Christmas.  On the 27th, we put in a request to the company to refund/exchange and they denied it saying it was past the 30 day.  ITS A CHRISTMAS GIFT!  I am extremely disappointed that they denied it. The clincher is that I can’t even contact the company!!  All in all cute shirts, but I have no patience with poor customer service and no way to contact a company with questions.",Negative
The cross was tiny,Negative
I gave it a 1 star for the color as it matched my bathroom accessories but it is so freaking small! I'm so disappointed.,Negative
I was a bit disappointed ☹️  I heard the soy melts gave a longer aroma. It was no different than the ones I get at discount store. This was higher price and lasted same.,Negative
"Looking at my purchases you will note a number of Otter gifts for my wife. I bought this several months ago but wasn't open until her birthday May 8th. Looking at the sculptor the manufacture has the otter on its back on a pointed rock. If, that's not ridiculous enough the otter is on a pin about an eighth of an inch above the rock. Total waste of money.",Negative
This is a very horrible poster it is not that motivational it only makes people feel like crap so shut your mouth and I do not recommend this poster.<br />Thanks for your time:),Negative
"These cards had the darkest energy, I requested a return of the deck and the seller never responded to me. I threw them out into the trash. I didn’t want them anywhere near me. Worst customer service!",Negative
"I think it looks pretty cool but would look much better with a glass cylinder to house the light. Also, no hardware to hang is included and although the manufacturer seemed nice, was pretty unhelpful with recommendations. The wire and housing are IKEA. I had to figure out and purchase bracket to hang myself with the help of two electricians.",Negative
Not made to the quality I expected,Negative
This bracelet had no color whatsoever...I'm really not convinced they were even opals.,Negative
"Such a disappointing print of a really great design. The sticker is so dark that you cannot see any of the delicate details - you woildnt know it was a d20 without having seen the image online first! All 3 stickers came out this way. Very dark, very disappointing.",Negative
"Loved the idea of this product, loved being able to spread seeds and have the name on it.  Way to small, hard to read.  Would not recommend unless they increased the size..",Negative
It was on printed paper for over $30. Sent back and after 1 week still haven't received refund,Negative
Was not as Aw picture,Negative
This bracelet was purchased it as a graduation gift.  I threw it in the trash because it was junk.  It looked like a carnival prize.,Negative
Sent me the wrong ring and in order to return it I have to pay the postage to India so not worth it I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED I ordered the one with the larger stone and thicker band that was the on I wanted .  I order this one for my mom and they sent her the one I ordered for myself.,Negative
"I ordered 2, one for me and one for my best friend. They just came and I put mine on, but the chain is SO much more shorter than the one pictured on the woman. Do NOT order this if you expect it to look like the photo. If it were any shorter, it would literally be a choker. ): It looks so silly on me.",Negative
I've had this item for 4 months and the zipper is already broken.,Negative
"Bad quality glue, dusk colors, won't recommend this one",Negative
Just go to the store and wrap a circle from wire like material.,Negative
Pretty design but so small it does not show up with really short hair.  would look better if it were a stud.,Negative
Very high price for a few photo cut outs hot glued to a few sticks. 😕<br />Really wish I'd had time to return this and order something else.,Negative
"So disappointed.  Three of the items in the gift box were not sealed.  One item looked like it had been a sample, it looked used.  Something leaked inside the box damaging the outside of the gift box.",Negative
Just got it. Worn it a few times. The circle has faded and tarnished. Not silver. Unable to clean Plan on returning it. Looked so pretty. I’m very dissatisfied,Negative
"I knew what I was getting on quality. What I did not realize, and now do somewhat by looking at item more online, is that there is a faint design on the photo paper that makes the background look dirty. I actually tried to wipe it off! It does not compliment the other design elements on the print. I don't even think I could display. Impulse purchase that I regret.",Negative
It broke after the second wear...NOT GOOD,Negative
"I specifically asked if my remarkable 2 would fit in the case with the cover on.  they assured me it would, you can check the questions.  I eagerly awaited my order only to find that it doesn't actually fit, the case doesn't even come close to latching with the cover on.  I am disappointed in the inaccurate info I received and the return process has proven difficult thus far.  Sad,  a great quality product that is useless isn't really a great product.<br /><br />Anyone that has a remarkable 2 knows you don't want to store it in anything without the remarkable protective cover attached.",Negative
I don't know who's genius idea it is to make an earring with jaggy sides but its not recommended. Instead if you have skinny toes I'd say your best use for it is instead as a toe ring.,Negative
"Love the design, but not what expected! I ordered black wood and it was dark wood!",Negative
"Ridiculously small. Not a real ring, its plastic.",Negative
This is small and cheap and can’t hold much money at all so if all you have is a few and I mean a few dollars then buy it otherwise DONT!,Negative
Loved the look but it is just thin paper and too fragile to hang. I laminated it for sturdiness,Negative
"I have tried on several occasions over the past 3 weeks to order this shirt. BUT, each time, it says that the order has to be customized first. Once I hit the customize how button, the dreaded wheel starts spinning and never stops. It never brings me to color, size, etc. Fix this and I will order",Negative
Came with two bubbles on the sterling,Negative
"Besides having to wait over a month for the item, when I finally received it, it was smaller than the pictures made it out to be. Plus, they gave me the wrong size; I ordered a size 16 gauge and they gave me who knows what cause it’s way too big.",Negative
This changed color within a few months and is now unwearable.,Negative
"Awful, looked like something taken from a child's coloring book. Sent it right back. $20, please, 50 cents, maybe.",Negative
"I was very unhappy with this, for one it was very expensive and when I received this it didn’t look like the photo. The colors were dull and it did not have the 3D effect like in the photo. There is a cut off line on the end of the flowers that just doesn’t look good. After getting my return shipping label it took a month to get my refund. I’m not one for writing bad reviews but I was very disappointed with this.",Negative
I ordered this for my daughter for christmas later to find out it is completely FAKE. Instead of Peridot like the product says. It’s acctually made out of glass. So beware before perchasing that it is FAKE,Negative
"Besides taking weeks for delivery, the letter is cheaply made and the finish is not suitable for outside display.<br />I'll never purchase from this vender again.",Negative
"I bought this as a gift, fortunately it came early. One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.",Negative
Its not a sign its just a poor quality print on photo paper,Negative
Paint work wasn’t what I expected to be.My son was kind of disappointed.poorly made,Negative
i purchase the item i never got it on time when i got it it pops the quality is awful for what you pay.,Negative
This does not fit the 2022 band. I was really disappointed.,Negative
This ring is well made but the stone was not anywhere near clear. Notified the seller and they refunded my money. I offered to return the ring but was told i did not need to do so.,Negative
Product not correct ring size of what I ordered and what I’ve ordered in the past . Right now she can’t wear it any suggestions or solutions??,Negative
The fabric on this dress is very thin and see through. The print is very cute but the colors look washed out and not even close to the vibrant print shown in picture. We use it as PJ's.,Negative
Was not what I expected. So disappointed,Negative
"Adorable &#34;little&#34; sign.  The lettering is stickers though.  Mine have bubbling under them.  It's slight and small but never the less, it's there. Never would I pay this much for stickers.  I will be returning it.",Negative

Bought this product I thought it was cute nose ring false advertising it said sterling silver not true it turn with in a couple of days don’t purchase this product very cheap...,Negative
"I am a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan, so I was very excited to see this shirt.  I bought it immediately. My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!",Negative
Breaks after first use,Negative
"I would give this product zero stars if possible.  Not only does it seem to be poorly 3d printed, but its overall junk. The plungers weren't even finished properly.<br /><br />Top that off with having to pay to return an unfinished product is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Update:  getting my refund was a nightmare too.  That was mostly Amazon's fault.",Negative
They were really pretty but were broken. I returned them and I had to pay the return shipping fee. I still have not got my money back it’s been over a month,Negative
This is my second order of this thumb ring but this second order is different the ring is very thin this time around am so not please with it.,Negative
Good quality but the ad is no right is not 2 bracelets is only ONE... change the ad and I will give you the 5 stars,Negative
broke in first week wearing it. I was just putting up my hair in a ponytail and it suddenly fell apart. Wish I knew sooner wouldn't last because waited awhile to wear it and now cannot return.,Negative
There was no image on the earrings.,Negative
Didn’t peel off properly a waste,Negative
"Overall this is a beautiful necklace,  but whoever did the work kinda did there own thing.  They did not use the font I choose and they did it in caps lock, which I purposely type out everything in lower case. It also was smaller than I was expecting. It’s a gift for my best friend, so I’m sure she will like it either way, but I was disappointed and bummed that it wasn’t how I ordered it.",Negative
Don't buy!  Cheap and too small!  The size of quarters and only one sided.  These are a perfect example of only-for-sale on the internet because NO ONE would buy them in person.  Too crappy to even go through the process of returning- just straight to the trash.,Negative
Maybe they need to invest in better laminate. Two of the 7 letters keep falling which pulls on the additional attached letters & I have to smooth them back out every couple days when I go in my daughter's room.,Negative
"Not sure what I was expecting here, but as this year has taught all of us; Expect the unexpected. The quality is fairly poor and not even centered on what appears to be foam board. Great idea but bot so great delivery.",Negative
Made the mistake of unpackaging in the car- both the driver & I immediately had to unroll our windows. The smell was super toxic. If that wasn’t enough to make me return the over all quality of product was lack luster- spotty dye on the leather (tbh I didn’t even bother to unsnap- just returned ASAP).,Negative
Came ripped at bottom.,Negative
"I feel like I could have bought this at Clair’s for $5. It’s a thin hoop and cute, but such a huge rip off and waste of money!",Negative
Image is very deceiving. You cannot fit a shucked raw oyster on the half shell in the wells on this plate which is what I purchased it for. Anything but the most minuscule oyster shell would be too big. Poorly designed product,Negative
Not worth the price,Negative
"Within the first 3 weeks the "" Gold plating""wore off. And I dint physically work with my hands all day. Im a construction super. Already down to the stainless and its makes it look cheap. Embarrassed to wear within a month . jeez",Negative
Bracelet doesn't look anything like the picture at all. Very disappointed. Bought for my grand daughter because of the color. Unable to give to her,Negative
These shower steamers work as they should but are so very strong it made my headache worse. I will probably try to break them and see if I can use just a tiny amount…,Negative
This product is very very nice looking. However I really expected more than a copy and paste type print.<br />I gave the artist and song title.<br />The print is obviously a cut and paste.<br />Just some common sense punctuation would be great.<br />Pretty much ruins it for us.,Negative
The excess string of the bracelet came out of the beads right away 😕,Negative
Turned green within day,Negative
"Looked very nice at first, but lost its shine after a short period. Not quality jewelry but you can't expect too much for the price.",Negative

"""gold"" colored chain turned to dirty silver, literally same day I took it out of the bag.  Don't waste your money on this item",Negative
Cheap material that broke after a few impressions.,Negative
Sent me a thin strip of paper scrap leather with laser cuts in it claiming it is premium leather and will last a long time... The laser etching alone was too deep for how thin the strap was. The strap is so thin that you cannot wear it with a watch and look normal. I will post pictures. When I requested a return the seller says I have to pay for shipping. I haven't used this thing and I am having to pay 10% to return this defective item? It is roughly half the thickness shown in the pictures. Maybe even less. They claim 3oz of leather and you end up getting... 4.8 grams. I cannot even make this up. This is so clearly a rip off.,Negative
Its Ultrasound Technologist- a technician has only on-the-job experience,Negative
"Low quality product that will apply with creases and look cheap, even if you apply it according to the instructions. It also costs $12 to return, so don't bother buying in the first place.",Negative

The paint was not dry when placed inside the cardboard casing. It was a destroyed mess. This is (or was) the guest book for my wedding which is in 2 weeks. I am extremely disappointed and unsatisfied with the carelessness that must have occured in order for the craftsmanship to be this poor.,Negative
Great prints but I should have taken the time to make them myself. Still great tho,Negative

Very small.,Negative
"Disappointed in the product and sent it back for a refund.  The necklace is very thin and super light.<br />It came with all the packaging you would need for gift giving, but it wasn’t at all worth the price.  Disappointed.",Negative
I admit when grandson put this on list… 8x10 didn’t ring thru as a “poster”. Just type font on fair 8x10 card stock paper. Nothing special… just a nice quote from Lin Manuel Miranda. I supposed He could have made it himself… as long as added quotes and he gave author credit! He was disappointed it wasn’t larger.  Buyer beware. Look at the size,Negative
"I've always wanted a world map with pins. This one is beautiful, but there are some things I'd caution buyers about.  Some of the pieces are not very well made. For instance, once I'd put the pin in the UK piece, it broke :(  Next, it's not very easy to assemble, especially on the floor. And once you put it on the wall, forget about trying to get it off again to make any adjustments...the pieces will break if you try to remove them from the wall. Also, double check your flags....some flags were wrong on mine (such as Peru) and some flags were in the wrong place (for me, the Saudi Arabia flag was in the place of Russia's flag). Google ALL flags before pinning them on your wall if you aren't 100% confident that you know the country's flag. I won't be returning mine because, as I said, it's difficult to remove it from the wall and I paid a lot of money for it...easier to just leave it as it is at this point.",Negative
Was great for maybe 3 weeks . Paint completely wore off,Negative
not wrist size at all but good quality,Negative
Not my loved one,Negative
"I purchased this as a gift and never opened the package because the box was nicely sealed in plastic. When my niece opened it on Christmas Day I was disappointed in the quality. I feel that these are random stones that are colored and encased in plastic<br />Also, the “free black onyx” pendant appears to be nothing more than hardened plastic<br />Future purchases will be from a stone & gem shop where I am sure I will be getting better quality than what is sold here",Negative
My husband loved it but I would of liked a more durable material for the metal,Negative
Thought it would smell nice. It smells horible.,Negative

"The tape would not stay stuck, had to tape the tape into place",Negative
Product was nothing like I expected. I will surely return it. This is the worst misrepresentation of an Amazon product I have encountered in my years of doing business with Amazon. This bracelet is a toy looking item ; nothing that represents a man's bracelet. If anything it was a baby bracelet.,Negative
"I normally don't write reviews, but I had to for this.<br />To start off, the packaging was terrible and my design came in a crumbled up mess.<br />When I removed the design I could tell that the corners were not all straight.<br />I now have a misshapened blob on my window.<br />Terrible, will never order again!",Negative
Completely inaccurate map?! Have the person who made it even know how the real work map looks like?? What is going on with Russia and China on this map. Please Amazon take this product down. It’s completely inaccurate,Negative

"We received this giant kerplunk game as a gift for our daughter. The item is not as pictured, the wood is of poor quality and cracked - and not painted as the picture makes it appear. The legs also broke off in shipping and the top mesh barely fits on top. Nothing that we can't fix ourselves, but total waste of money. Since I didn't buy the item myself, not sure if I can do anything about the purchase....",Negative
"Maybe it's just my skin, but this did not have the sweet smell of Patchouli that I'm used to. I read in some of the reviews that it has a ""dirt"" smell but there were enough others that said it had a great smell.<br /><br />For me it smelled exactly like dirt. Not bad, if that makes sense, but definitely like dirt. I waited an hour or so to see if the scent would change, like some wrote. It didn't change, it just faded.",Negative
"In comparison against recently purchased orgone pyramids, this particular orgone pyramid quality is okay. It feels like this tiny  little guy was rushed. Cloudy at the point of the pyramid. The metal wrapping of the quartz crystal, is a mess. Bubbles at the point of the product. Meh. Too bad. I want to like it. Selenite is one of my fav . Am I being too judgemental?<br />The proportion of Selenite and metal flakes seems good. The symbol is nice.",Negative
Does absolutely nothing for u,Negative
I believe I was sent the wrong color and/or size. The quality is also not the best. You could bend the name if you wanted to. The name part is thin and nothing is as thick as the picture looks. Not worth the $!,Negative
"If you are bigger than a size 2 you wont be able to wear these fanny packs around your waist like they're intended for. Horrible product. Wouldnt recommend these to anyone. And not to mention the seller, CampusConnection is giving me a hard time when trying to request a refund. Horrible customer service on their end",Negative
"This is just literally two pieces of paper. Not framed, not even thick paper. Ridiculous And hands down not worth $15 plus tax!",Negative
Didnt like it.  It came broke.,Negative
I thought i was getting a hand drawing but it was just a print. Not very happy at all.,Negative
One of the products arrived unsealed.  The products are very homemade looking.  I don't trust using an unsealed product that appears to be made in someone's home.,Negative
"Only wore it once..went to put it on for work today..it didn't retract back. A complete waste of money. Might as well go to the dollar store, it last longer",Negative
[[VIDEOID:483894f52c00f96e02ae542ecdcb5b7]] Didn’t read the details and didn’t realize it’s just printed on a sheet of paper. Thought it would be a canvas type of set :/,Negative
Not what I expected.,Negative
"These earrings are not pretty at all, they are not real stainless steel. Within 2 weeks of having them in my ears they tarnished.. 10/10 would not recommend these earrings.",Negative
the product is so small! it is better that have a photo to compere the size with something. now that I want to return the shipping is more than half the price of the item! this is ridiculous!,Negative
This picture was supposed to have a rocket on it. Mine came no rocket on the print. I discovered this after I got it framed. Not sure how to get in touch with the seller so that they can rectify the situation. I’d be glad to remove my review if I receive a replacement with a rocket on it.,Negative
This was extremely small I contacted seller she told me she would give me<br />Another one and wasn’t using the t-shirt company anymore. Now months later I still don’t have another shirt and no refund,Negative
Ugh!! This took over 4 weeks to arrive. Customer service was HORRIBLE!  I got an amazon refund due to delays but would still send back regardless.  So cheaply made!!  I tried out on front door but will need suction cups as so light and able to do damage with wind,Negative
Love the shirt but was a tad too small. Epic Design refused to let me return for a bigger size. So if you order from this company order a size up or your screwed.,Negative
Bag is okay. Think of Dollar General Quality. Cheap decal. Color incorrect and not able to exchange or return. Keep looking if you want to gift to someone!,Negative
Hello Kitty emblem easily came off within 2 days of use,Negative
"Certainly not worth the money, but I didn't have time to send it back...so I kept it.",Negative
Highly disappointed. Its like someone cut out a piece of a newpaper and drew a giraffe on it. I could get the same thing at the dollar tree WITH a frame for a buck. Dont buy,Negative
Thought this would be bigger and better quality,Negative
It was a little misleading its just an 8×10 print I could have gotten at walmart for 5 bucks,Negative
Too small names barely legible,Negative
This was very disappointing. Wasn’t made well and not good product material,Negative
"The item i ordered looks different than the one i got ... see pictures<br /><br />1st picture has a nice elegant clip<br />2nd picture has my hand ...only comes with a button ...<br /><br />Disappointed customer.  If you're able to send me the one on the 1st picture, that would make me really REALLY HAPPY",Negative
Received the item…. The print was cut crooked and it was just a standard printer paper…. The paper also had a stain on the bottom. Definitely wouldn’t order.,Negative
I bought this hoop for my second hole in my nose it was very hard to put in when I did get it in it didn’t look right with the one I bought at the tattoo shop which is 14k gold hoop took it out and used it for one of my earring holes not really amazed by this one tho it’s very tiny especially if you have nails it won’t work I used tweezers lol,Negative
This tee is sooo long. Unfortunately I didn't know that I cannot return or exchange. Not impressed.,Negative
Too small,Negative
Wished I had looked closer,Negative
Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money.,Negative
It is pretty and the photos are true to the way that it appears but it is not sturdy at all for it to fall apart from the chord.,Negative
I didn't like it. I thought it was made from plastic or metal,Negative
"Wouldn't stick to the wall, was very careful and used a blow dryer to try and get to stick still no luck. Pulled it down and am currently looking for a different product. Awful.",Negative
I really liked the stamped pieces....I feel like the chains could have been a little thinner.,Negative
"Unfortunately, the photo of the model wearing this was deceptive to me. When it arrived, it was MUCH larger than it looked in the photo, and I sent it back. Great design, though -- just too large for me.",Negative
not as expected,Negative
Seriously clearly fake and print is huge. Too big for my taste. Do not purchase. Can’t return.,Negative
I sent it back.  This &#34;sign&#34; is thick printer paper. For this price I at least expected cardboard.,Negative
Not impressed with the gaps in the wood and the flatness of the top. You can’t set things flat as boards are different heights.,Negative
Looks great.  But it turned my husband finger green on day one. I do not recommend getting it. A ring at this price should not do that. Made me very very sad.,Negative
"The fabric and monogram were fine but the apron was more than three inches narrower than it should have been  - less than 19” and supposed to be 22”. Additionally, the loop for the head was too small to make it over the child’s head! The second apron (not pictured) had a loop for a gigantic head and it was also narrower than they said it would be. Sent them both back and because it was faulty, Amazon credited my account. Would be afraid to order anything else from the company that made them!",Negative
Great quality and amazing design however the measurements were 8x10 instead of 11x14,Negative
"I purchased these in the rose gold color as a gift for my friends for our upcoming Vegas girls weekend. The wording is so light that in normal lighting you can’t even see whose cup is whose. Unfortunately I was not granted the opportunity to exchange it for ones with more contrast. The rose gold tone was a complete fail, and sadly the shop owner knew that as she stated in an email to me that the contrast is very light in the rose gold color.  It would have been nice knowing that before I spent that much money. Perhaps add that to the description. Lesson learned. Other than that they would be very cute in another color.",Negative
"I waited 30 days of shipping to get these two toe rings. These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!",Negative
Paper strips are wrong weight(grams/square meter) - need to be a lighter weight to properly form the points of the star,Negative
Runs really small. 3x fits like a large.,Negative
The beads and bracelet are much smaller than I thought it would be.  The front keeps tangling. The beads are very tiny.  I was disappointed.,Negative
This was very underwhelming. I was planning on buying a ton of these and am very glad I didn't. My fiancee`s last name was left off even though I requested it. Where some of the words are wood burned in they are not clear and difficult to read and the magnent on the back looks like it was just thrown on there (not in a good place to keep this on my fridge). This falls off of my fridge daily and i am very glad I did not buy these for my guests. Shipping also took over a month.,Negative
Not very moisturizing. More like a lip gloss that lasts less than 30 minutes.,Negative
The lettering at the bottom of the photo did not print properly and has most of the information regarding the species cut off and not visible.,Negative
I got these bracelets in the mail today..opened them and they are literally the size of my pinky? That’s not going to fit anyones wrist. Will be returning,Negative
Not for LT wear.<br />This discolored & did not have luster it once did after 2 weeks of daily use. Sad.  Very nice on arrival !,Negative
El imán no es muy fuerte,Negative
Like the product yet needs company needs to pack better to avoid shipping damage.,Negative
It came all scratched up on both sides. I'm so disappointed.,Negative
I never received this. Too bad. Kind of expensive.,Negative
It cheap. It’s plastic.,Negative
"However it was bent (might have been delivery person's fault) but because it was bent, there was a giant crease up and down the card.  therefore the card was ruined before I could give it to a friend.",Negative
"My fault for not reading completely, but this is just one set of 3 pot feet. I will just be buying the ones from my local nursery for a third of the price. Wasted money on this one.",Negative
Broke after 2 months<br />Highly disappointed,Negative
Returned.....Color different than advertised. Quality of hardware was degraded.  Very disappointed. Also delivered 3 Days past promised delivery.,Negative
Broke within a week of getting it,Negative
"Very cheap, not worth the money and it's plastic!",Negative
Had to punch holes in.one of shoulder straps. There were no holes for buckle. They stated can't you just do it yourself. Shouldn't half to do it period. I thought it was included in the price.,Negative
When the photo backdrop poster was taken out of the shipping box there were permanent creases in the poster. We followed the process for clueing the poster to foamboard. These ceases would not come out nor allow the poster to lay flat. The picture frame cutout shown in the attached photo will show these creases. We could not send the item back due to us using the backdrop for an event that weekend.,Negative
"I received this on Saturday and on Monday, I got it ready for work. Wallet, some pens, a small notebook and my phone. Wore it to work. Received nice comments on it. Repeated on Wednesday.<br /><br />Thursday morning, after approximately having used the bag very lightly for 16 total hours, most of that sitting on a desk, I go to leave the house with it and notice 3 puncture holes on the front. I panic at perceieved damage before realizing the buckle has come off. I look everywhere but can't find it. Depressed because a bag I like lacks quality, I file for a return.<br /><br />I get into the car and find the buckle on the floor. It was apparently held on by 3 very small prongs, which are now just slightly open, meaning it fell off from shifting and wasn't due to handling. I consider fixing it, but after re-examining the bag, there is no way to get up against the area where the prongs will go to reseat them from the inside.<br /><br />Then it makes me wonder what will happen if I put actual weight in the bag. Right now, it is super stiff, so even full, there wouldn't be much pressure exuded on the straps, but when it begins to loosen and become slack, those little tiny prongs aren't going to hold things safely closed.<br /><br />I was really wanting to like this bag. I have had it on my list for ages...blah.<br /><br />By the way, a 15.6"" laptop barely fits, and with a sleeve, there is basically no way to close the flap, hence my using it as a purse. On top of that, it is so stiff, and has very little lining, that one would probably not feel comfortable without a padded sleeve.",Negative
The size was right but the good side had the sticky glue so unless you are putting it under glass it is useless<br />However I sent an email and was promptly refunded for the purchase,Negative
"I ordered these in late September as a holiday gift. They appeared fine in the clear plastic box. But when the earrings were taken out, I found the setting did not seem to fit the stones well. There are gaps between the stone and its silver setting in places, and one of the earrings has a small bend in the setting at about 10 o'clock as seen in the first photo.  I clicked on return, and then return to seller, but received an automatic notice that the return period has expired.  I was hoping to avoid holiday rush backlog by ordering early.  The stone is nice although heavier and the profile is higher than expected. But the silver setting is poorly formed, at least in my opinion.",Negative
Pretty but WAY too small consirding I was asking for a “large” heart and it kept popping up on “on my list”,Negative
"I was so excited for this product and knew as soon as it was delivered that I had made a huge mistake, not worth the price and the smallest of my stones was under 15mm. I have tiny hands so this reference picture doesn’t even properly demonstrate just how small these are. Unfortunately they’re gorgeous and I just can’t let them go, but if I do regret buying them",Negative
"When I first received the Beanie, it did not look like it would keep you warm. As a matter of precaution, I hand-washed the Beanie to remove any harmful chemicals that might be coating this product. I put the Beanie on and it barely fit my head. Then when I wore it on a cold day, the wind went right through the loose weave on the Beanie. I'm severely disappointed with this product and would warn people about these issues.",Negative
"It's one thing to be handmade. It's another to just be sloppy. These were an embarrassment to give to my husband for our anniversary. Luckily he's a great guy and just laughed it off, but what a disappointment. The monogram isn't even close to being centered and both the money clip and tie clip are bent out of shape a little, so the don't line up",Negative
Dont waste your money.,Negative
Packaging was nice it came well packaged and had all hardware but it didn’t not come with in instructions to install and the shelf will not fold flat,Negative
"Very disappointed! After 60 days the personalization can barely be read. My mat is even on a covered porch. I purchased it as a gift a month before given to my son, so just pass 90 days and they won’t replace the mat.",Negative
"Card is about half the size of a typical bitprthday card.  Also, the card says”They Say Its Your Birthday”, on the outside and nothing on the inside.  Its really a note card, not a birthday card.",Negative
"Kept the pits perfumed and odorized for a max two hours before fading; and this occurred 24/7. Not to mention the something-wood scent was not even strong and satisfying. Have a second thought before spending your money on the wood-scented one, maybe the lavender would be different. Total ripoff.",Negative
"Do not purchase this..it is not free return,,,it has no shape.  I bought 2 and both men cannot even wear it!  It goes over their noses and below their chins with no shape just hanging fabric.",Negative
"Very nice, but too small. But it fit fine in the entry of my church!!",Negative
"Just paper prints, nothing special.<br />No frame or canvas😢",Negative
Very small and light metal.,Negative
Couldn't get it to stick to wall.,Negative
I was so disappointed in this item.  It was definitely not worth $18.00.  It looks like I picked it up at a dollar store.  The monogram is very small and the ink is faint.  Even the card stock is on the thin side.  I would not purchase this item again and will probably return it.,Negative
"This sweatshirt is absolute garbage. It is thin, poor quality and the graphic on the sweatshirt was crooked and bled onto other parts of the sweatshirt as if it was folded up before it was dry..And on top of that the return policy is such a hassle I am just going to keep it anyway. Also.. if you DO decide To deal with returning it they charge a 20% fee.",Negative
Beautiful toy but the balls on the rope didn't seem particularly secure to me. The rope part just looked glued in. It's possible it would have been fine but it seemed like it could be a choking hazard especially since this is designed for very young babies.,Negative
Que la piedra se nota falsa,Negative
The cords are waxed and cannot be adjusted. The attached prettys are junk.,Negative
"Very pretty but didn't last. Normal wear, didn't catch on anything.  Just fell apart when my daughter picked up to put it on.",Negative
Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.,Negative
This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly. The seller insisted I bought the wrong case for my model phone... I did not. The case is not made properly. The only option I was given was to replace the case with the same case. No thanks.,Negative
These are quite small rings. I wouldn't recommend for your nostril. I bought these because I have one nostril pierced and I'm toying with getting the other one pierced too. These are too small to reach to the same height on my nose that my other piercing sits at. They are very pliable but it doesn't work for me.,Negative
great,Negative
I received one soap cube. Not four cubes as was clearly advertised. This is very deceptive.,Negative
This product was poor quality and not as described.,Negative
"There are ZERO 4 or 5 star reviews, see for yourself click on one......From the looks of the mask on Amazon the squirrel appears to be sewn or embroidered in....it’s not. It’s a small squirrel iron on patch that’s been ironed onto a cheap flat fabric mask.  The squirrel s already coming unglued on the outside. Mask has no nose clip and no contoured chin. There is no filter pocket either. The mask is NOT adjustable at the ears so whatever the fit is it’s the best you’re going to get.... pretty sad really In my opinion it’s not worth the $14.95 total including shipping<br />Side note, there are no 5 or 4 star reviews, yet they show the 5 star at 55%....something isn’t right about that",Negative
Well I did like this bracelet and I still do..but I got this when I was dating my ex..ugh. Why does it have to be so cute! Lol I still recommend getting it if your special someone is a firefighter!,Negative
I can't charge my PS Vita 1001 Phat OLED It's made for the slim,Negative
Not sure if you’re able to do this but you need a gender option because in the photos it’s fairly flat mine is just feminine. If it’s hand made it should be easy to make it like the picture. Don’t get me wrong it’s nice and fit right but smh. What a disappointment that was. All that waiting time and money for me to flatten it out myself or pay more for someone else to do it.,Negative
Product arrived in a pretty box with paper stuffing and a bow on it - nice. But the bottle leaked so there was nothing left for me to use.,Negative
"Cheap & cheesey looking, mistake buying.",Negative
Definitely not worth the money. Go get it at walmart for the same price but bigger,Negative
"I just got this today and it's a very nice bracelet. However, they sent the wrong size! I ordered the Small 8.75 inches, but they sent me the Medium 9.25 inches. So, now I'll have to send it back for a replacement. What a pain! Still very nicely made and with quality leather. Hopefully, they'll send the correct size soon.",Negative
Worn once one of the jewels fell off,Negative
"I thought they would be bigger, they are the size of a small key ring as you can see in the photo. They seem a little flimsy. I will use the item, hopefully it will not break quickly. I’m not angry about them but, I probably won’t buy again.",Negative
The stones were doll one of the earrings didn’t hang right. And then Amazon wouldn’t take them back I have to pay to ship them back which is almost what I paid for the earrings. So unhappy with them but I guess they’re mine the ratings no stars,Negative
"It came bent, had to return.",Negative
sad. this is a beautiful ring but it is not surgical stainless steel and is giving me an infection,Negative
"Bought it to wear to a court hearing on 3/1...Well, It was beautiful necklace. I wore it for 3 hours. I handled it delicately when i was adjusting the clasp to the back of my neck after it shifted to the front, and the chain snapped like a twig. The chain was flimsy.  Pretty dissapointed. ⭐️ ⭐️=shipping & price",Negative
"I am disappointed in the size of the Ulu. It is for a man with larger hands and I don’t see how this will work.  For $129 I thought it looked much larger. Not sure since it’s a gift, what to do.",Negative
This looks like it is a actual dictionary page…it is not. This is a very bad print of a dictionary page with Alaska printed on top of it.<br />I was extremely disappointed in this product.,Negative
"They were pretty, but I received them broken.  Since I was concerned about the quality, I just returned them for a refund.",Negative
Very cute but it needed to be slightly bigger and when I screwed it on it’s lifting a little on the edge because it didn’t cover completely,Negative
"Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit",Negative
It was supposed to be Nana on the big bear and Lily on the small . I can't wear it,Negative
"Definitely not what I expected. Has absolutely no lather to it at all. Smell is good. Seems to be too oil based. Would not purchase again! I have started ordering a homemade whip from a local vendor, 14oz for $14. Also offer an assortment of different scents and goes a long way!",Negative
"Super cute but straw is so small, it is barely functional.",Negative
Pretty necklace but the chain broke on the first day at the area where the chain hooked up with the stones,Negative
"Everything is there except the star, and that is why I bought the right",Negative
The pearls are flat on 1 side. The cat is really cute. I'm sending back because I don't like the pearls shape. I'm very disappointed.,Negative
Bracelet turned green after 1 month. Disappointed,Negative
"A bit too small, but still cute!",Negative
Very unsatisfied with product if it weren’t for being personalized I would be sending it back. Blanket is so thin and it’s obvious it’s cheaply made.,Negative
clasp was crappy and it fell off and has since been lost. It looked real nice while I had it. Bummed I lost it.,Negative
The design was nicely done but no way was this shirt an XXL.  I wear a medium and the shirt  JUST fit me. Very disappointed. There was no size tag on the shirt anywhere so I am not even sure it is an XXL.,Negative
Literally impossible to get on. Sent back.,Negative
It was stiff and uncomfortable to wear!,Negative
I dislike everything!!!,Negative
"Very disappointed, cheaply made.",Negative
"Way, way to small and way to lightweight! Not worth the money. Cheaply made.",Negative
Bought this as a birthday gift for my wife. Very disappointed that the horse is not very dark as shown in the picture. You can barely see the horse.,Negative
"I'm so upset, I open the package to find that the cup was cracked.",Negative
"These are great quality.  But it's obviously for NOT for anyone with medium or large wrists. I was fooled by the pictures.  I thought the bracelets were thicker and just more substantial than what they actually are. Measure your wrists before purchase, and don't expect the bracelets to be like the pic.",Negative
Nope. The word handmade is very misleading. This is a literal photocopy of something that someone may have made. It's is printed on photo paper. I was going to give it to my mother. Instead I'm returning it and getting her something that doesn't look like a copy of something made with glitter.,Negative
"Horrible product does not smell anything like China Rain, bummer! This smells like chemicals",Negative
I wanted to love these.....So cheap looking!,Negative
The actual product was smaller than Amazon photo depicted. Very disappointed & will return ‼️,Negative
Wasn't what I expected.,Negative
broken we really needed it as soon as possible.,Negative
I expected it to be a bit bigger. I was disappointed!,Negative
Thought it was bigger than it is.,Negative
It's thicker than I would like for it to be. Make sure you have a roomy wallet to fit it in. Don’t recommend.,Negative
"I don't know whether they sent me the wrong product or what, but the only way this works as a leave-in conditioner is if you don't mind being an oil slick and looking slimey.  VERY disappointed and will not be ordering anything from this company again.  If this stuff is what I ordered, it's horrible, if the company cannot process orders correctly, that's also horrible.  Avoid at all costs unless you want to look like a greaser from the 50s.",Negative
This bracelet I bought is already turning silver. It didn’t last but 2weeks with vold. Also the little bar that the name is put on is soo small you can’t even read the name. Letters are small too. I was very disappointed,Negative
So disappointed. The writing is MUCH lighter than on picture. The charm on the bracelet I purchased from my daughter in law fell off on day 2. I felt terrible.,Negative
"when you try and personalize any of them, it wont let me",Negative

Not a great product.  Doesn’t match the site description,Negative
Don’t fit snug on ears,Negative
"This stuff is exactly as I didn’t terms of appearance. What its missing is it's ability to block odor as promised, essentially the reason I bought it.",Negative
Melted pink rose thing,Negative
Not sturdy enough to hold wands a while standing. Ripoff,Negative
I want to love this. It's beautiful. It's just so flimsy it won't hold up to being worn without bending. Any more bending and I'm sure it'll break. I'm so sad,Negative
This is really cute but very flimsy. I thought it would be more than just a piece of card stock with glitter on it. I could have made this at home.,Negative
It’s hard to keep close and it’s made of a flimsy material. It’s super thin so i don’t recommended it being a first hoop,Negative
"The item arrived bent. Aside from that, the pictures are so small you can hardly see any detail. The paper quality seemed good, but the printing was less than stellar. Not something I would spend the money framing. I sent a msg to the seller about my concerns and never heard back from them. Hard pass on this item.",Negative
Much too small!,Negative
Not what was advertised. Disappointed.,Negative
Not what I expected at all,Negative
This is a beautiful and great idea if I were to buy in a store or at a garden center. Unfortunately it didn’t travel well and probably won’t last another week. My apologies for the bad review but my experience was not a good one.,Negative
Cute but definitely NOT worth the price!,Negative
"This item does not say what material is made of, I bought it thinking it had gold in it. When I used it, it completely infected my nose piercing in two days. I’m allergic to most metals but not the gold filled ones, not sure if this has any gold in it but not worth the few dollars it costs",Negative
I was very dissatisfied! Poor Quality ring base. Stone looked to be manufactured. The inclusions were more like plastic chips then organic debris. The stone was loose in the setting. Being a third party the normally straight forward Amazon return policy does not apply.<br />The seller accepted the return of sent to Istanbul Turkey at my expense. This would have cost me more than half the price of the Ring itself. I saw this stipulation nowhere in the ad for this item.,Negative
I literally could have printed this myself at home. It is just printed glossy paper. Complete disappointment. Do not waste your money.,Negative
Very pretty but the backings that came with the earrings didn’t fit. One of them fell out of my ear during the day never to be seen again. Also when tou put them on notice that they can’t go in the same direction unless you put them in only one ear.,Negative
Very cheap and fell apart fairly quickly.,Negative
Loved the shirt until I took it out of a cold water delicate wash. I was really looking forward to showing the shirt off on my trip in 3 days,Negative
Top picture looks very metallic. What I received looks flat near black,Negative
Broke the first time I took it off. Complete waste of money.,Negative
Read description!,Negative
"What a disappointment. There is a very slight hint of honeysuckle which dissipates the moment you put the powder on. The packaging is a disaster as the minute you take the top off, powder goes everywhere (and it has an unpleasant chalky feel). Lastly, it doesn't absorb moisture which is the main purpose of dusting powder.",Negative
"Don’t get fooled like I did! This thing was TINY! I ordered for a baby shower for my daughters first child,and was shocked when I recieved box!☹️",Negative
This product comes without frames but they advertised canvas mounting fraud,Negative
Didnt smell sweet at all. Smells old. Like an elderly person,Negative
"Unfortunately it just looks cool, it doesn’t brush your beard really at all. The teeth are just not good for combing your beard. So now I have it on my dresser as a display piece",Negative
This “nose ring” looked like a thin piece of cheap wire twisted to look like a nose ring. Could’ve made it myself. Terrible quality.,Negative
I don’t like it . When I badge the string comes out but it won’t go back again,Negative
"Necklace received, looks way different then what was pictured. Will be returning.",Negative
"I like it, the saying is beautiful, but this is NOT engraved, the print is raised and after a couple of weeks the lettering is already fading.",Negative
It last 2 weeks,Negative
Without a doubt this is not pure titanium. This should feel as light as aluminum. Feels like and looks like stainless steel.  Rip-off at this price. Should be priced at about $20 - $25.  I will return for money back.,Negative
"This sheath is very well made.  Looks very good and the inclusion of the belt loop is nice.  The biggest problem with this sheath is how tight it is.  I’m talking dangerously tight.  I put my BK9 in and it took everything I had to get it out.  A very dangerous situation for yourself and anyone around.  The price is reasonable for what you get, but at that price range you’d expect a better fit for your knives.  I’m sure there’s a way to reheat it and get a better fit but for a custom made sheath it’s too dangerous as is.",Negative
Stones fell out,Negative
This product was 8x11 photo paper. No frame just photo printed.,Negative
Many of the listings show the signs being displayed outside however they are made from pine and NOT for outdoor display.,Negative
I returned not what I was expected,Negative
"The material around the amulet started to dissolve, causing the amulet to disconnect from the rope.",Negative
Very disappointed. Smaller than shown. Hard to clasp. Dull.,Negative
You can't see what's on the coins  as well as you can in the pics. I was disappointed.,Negative
much bigger and thicker than described.,Negative
Cute when first on. Tried several ways to make it stay in place. Every time the watch would be moving around and the rest of the band very tight.,Negative
Bracelet for children. No man can wear this. Pretty but should be more clear about the size,Negative
"I as well thought this came with the tassel, Amazon has strict rules on the main default picture only including what comes with the item.",Negative
this nose ring is super cheap and made my nose break out,Negative
Very flimsy! Broke same day,Negative
My was were sore within a few hours- super cheap! Listing says faux druzy but it’s literally cheap plastic. Will be sending back.,Negative
I already send it back to the address they gave me wrong spelling the parents was not happy to thin I mail it out 7/21/22,Negative
"My sister bought these for me as a gift. The image made them look so beautiful. While I do like the earrings sent to me, these are NOT $30 earrings. I could have made these just as easily. I feel so bad that my sister spent so much money on these earrings because they hardly resemble the image. Cheap craft glitter was used too and the image clearly shows flakes of some sort. Honestly just a disappointment.",Negative
The pictures I received were clearly over-processed.  Areas that should demonstrate dimensional texturing were nearly blacked out.  Disappointed!,Negative
"stone was below the bezel, flat and unpolished",Negative
"This is absolutely not what is pictured. It came in a horrible box, crushed. The sweet message was not in there. This is a horrible lie, you don’t get what it says you do. It looks cheap.",Negative
They didn't smell at all when I put them in the warmer!!,Negative
Too small,Negative

Cheaply made stickers  Very Thin.  but the worst part was they misprinted the date.  refused to refund.  DO NOT USE,Negative
This was much smaller than I expected,Negative
"Be aware, you are about to pay for the most expensive piece of paper ever. This is shipped in a big box, stuffed with many things and at the bottom you will find a piece of paper printed with what you see on the picture. I could have printed the exact same thing on my printer and saved 12 dollars.",Negative
I basicaly purchased it for the peonia. been very carefull with it until I can see how the color of the beed are mixing and is getting a hole in the middle. Dissapointed,Negative
Definitely getting my money back!!! This is nowhere near the amount that was in the description. Smh. I brought this to fill my bridesmaids boxes. It was barely enough to fill to boxes.,Negative
"Cute, but didn’t last for a second wear. Overpriced",Negative
The graphics don't come out like the online images. Very disappointing. The peonies especially are just a blur. Definitely not worth $18.,Negative
Started peeling off,Negative
These as not as advertised. I bought one and it was not the color I wanted or was advertised. We contacted the seller who to get another shirt and they were hard to deal with. But they finally shipped us another shirt. The second shirt that was shipped to us and it was still the wrong color. The fit was as expected just not the right colors.,Negative
"Ring looks nothing like pictures. Stone sits a good 2 cm above band which makes it look like something out of a gumball machine. I requested a return and it was accepted, but when I went to send it back it was going to cost me $60 in shipping. Rediculous. Really wish I had read the reviews. Buy at your own risk- it costs more than the ring to send it back!",Negative
The color was very pretty but the slime was watery. The children could not play with it we had to throw it away. I do not recommend buy the commercial brand instead .,Negative
Doesn't fit well.<br />Looks cheap and poor quality.<br />Don't buy it.,Negative
It was not what I ordered and there was no paper work for me to return it.  I had ordered 2 of the same bracelet with the memorial saying but it was not the same bracelet.  Not happy with it at all.  Will not wear.,Negative
Very small compared to what it actually looks like in photo here. Super bummed out 😔,Negative
Name is placement is too high on the bracelet!  It looks as though the lower case l was first stamped as an i- with a dot on the top then restamped as an l over it.<br />Not happy with my purchase.  Also this four letter name was spread out over the whole bracelet.  It makes it look as though they were just trying to fill the space.  I contacted the seller.  Still waiting to hear back.,Negative
"If you have an extra large head these would be perfect.  They are nice material. I was having trouble finding a nask to fit,y husband. These cover his face from his Adam’s Apple to the lower eyelid.",Negative
Didnt get it until 4 months after the party. Just arrived last weekend and was all wrinkled.,Negative
This item is SMALL nothing like advertised. The item was listed for $20 after everything it cost $89 for NOTHING. Do not waste your money or time. It took several weeks to arrive to say I am disappointed is a high understatement. I will be returning this garbage today!,Negative
Band broke after 1 week,Negative
The part that connects the stone to the necklace. Broke within two days. 😪,Negative
"Nice, but for the price I would expect better quality not just a picture on photo paper",Negative
Didnt realize it was unframed,Negative
It was for myself and the bracelet was beautiful but the clasp did not work and it made the bracket unwearable. So disappointed.,Negative
I was so excited when the product arrived but was unable to transfer to the wall.,Negative
The pendant is gorgeous and well crafted but the chain broke the same day for no reason! If you have other chains you can wear it’s totally worth it!,Negative
The cobalt stone came off of one post but color is beautiful,Negative
Had more rust on it than I thought for being just bought.  Not as cute as picture.,Negative
Very flimsy.,Negative
The organizer does not fit at all. Seller accepts return but buyer have to pay for shipping!,Negative
Looked beautiful when received but the necklace is so thin it broke the night of my daughters birthday. She didn’t even get to wear it for a day. Not worth the money or the hassle of a return. Would not recommend.,Negative
"They are so small & thin. They could fall out of your ear and you would never even notice. If they hit the ground good luck finding them. Sorry to say, but it’s my opinion.",Negative
"Disappointing to see the knot in between beads.  Otherwise, very beautiful stones.",Negative
I purchased this as a memorial gift for a friend. Unfortunately you could barley see the name engraved.,Negative
They are very pretty but don't stay on your ears as they are supposed to.,Negative
"I could have ordered a print from the local CVS.  This isn't worth the money, just a cheap copy.  And the print is too far to the right and the letter ""N"" in the word AGAIN looks like it's falling off the page since it's printed at the very end of the paper.  I'm sending this back.  I can't put this in a frame since the frame would cut off the letter.  This was to be a gift but I would be embarrassed to give it to someone.  The seller should be ashamed trying to sell 10 cent prints for $12.99.",Negative
"Cute little nose stud (although expensive I’ll admit). Had it in for 2 days…fell out twice, second time sadly I was showering & down the drain it went.<br />The design isn’t coiled inside so it comes out very easily.",Negative

Junk hard leather. Very hard to even tie.,Negative
No me gustaron las letras fueron muy incómodas para pegarlas,Negative

wrong color and they wouldn't do anything about it. The color was wrong they just its right ad that was it.,Negative
It didn't work for me.,Negative
Tarnished on me within 2 weeks and the chain made me itch,Negative
Cute but wish it stuck better,Negative
This quote is missing the second parentheses at the end.,Negative

"It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.",Negative
Necklace arrived made incorrectly. Will not order again.,Negative
Great color but false advertised as emerald not natural emerald either adventurene or glass,Negative
"made with cheap materials. broke the same day we got it, just attaching it to a backpack zipper",Negative
Nothing about this is extra large and they do not adhere as promised. Total waste of money,Negative
"Extremely overpriced for the size. I gave it 2 stars simply because it is cute and Mickey Mouse. Otherwise, I would have given it a 1. The greenery is plastic, not realistic looking at all. There were hot glue strands all over the ears that I had to remove. It claims to be 10”, but from the top of the ear to the bottom of the wreath, it is 7”. From ear to ear across, it is only 9”. I feel like I was completely ripped off.",Negative
I ordered and paid for four and only received ONE,Negative
"I felt in love with this necklace, but the pendant began to turn a color like copper and had to through it away;  I really liked it.",Negative
"Smells good, doesn’t work. I used it for some lower back pain (muscular) can’t even tell I put it on. Waste of money.",Negative
Overall bad not what I expect trust me,Negative
"Even though the description says the sticker is water proof, the first time my stocker got wet from my water bottle it was ruined.",Negative
"Looks NOTHING like the photo.  The ""stamped"" letter isbarely legible, not the dark inked stamp like in the photo. The horse charm and birthstone are nice, the chain is not the best of quality. I purchased for an 8 year old but was expecting it to be a little nicer.",Negative
I LOVE these hoops. I use them for my first and second piercings. They are so comfortable I’ve left them in for nearly a month at a time. I forget they’re there. And they’re absolutely adorable!<br />The only thing I don’t like is that the silver literally turned BLACK. This could have just been a fluke in the one earring because it only occurred in the one earring. I will be ordering a new set to see if this happens again. Will update in a few months!<br /><br />UPDATE: The new ones also turned black after a few weeks! Save your money and just don't buy these! I am returning the new ones and wont be buying again. They are cheap quality,Negative
I love the planner but the product arrived with damage.  It appeared as if something sliced every page before it went into its plastic packaging.  I was able to cut off every page without loosing too much of the planner and use it.,Negative
Should have paid attention to “unframed” probably wouldn’t have brought a piece a paper that I still had to frame😂😂,Negative
"I don't love these. They are very dainty, which I wanted, but because there is no real clasp to them and you just have to close the ends together they get stuck in my ear and it hurts. I'm constantly adjusting them to makw them look okay. They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes. I probably wouldn't buy these again. Very light weight and dainty but that was the only part I liked about them",Negative
Wish they had put it in a box. The cam had a dent the Santa letter was tearing from one end. The only thing that wasn’t destroyed was the elf. Perfect gift! It was just damaged on its way to our home:(,Negative
Ordered a size 8 and I don’t know what size it is but it doesn’t fit and it’s not returnable,Negative
"I love Columbia’s fragrances, however this one is less than desirable. I was expecting something similar to the scent of the Poly. This is not it.",Negative
I usually buy these on the boardwalk. I moved to a landlocked state and missed home. So I grabbed these. I am disappointed. These are low quality and cheap.,Negative
bent too easy and once in nose doesn't hold form when you re close it. rolls around and catches. swelling occurred overnight. super tiny only 5 year olds can manipulate it. i contemplated tweezers if that helps,Negative
This watch band is very cute. I love the design but no matter what i did it would fit right. My watch didnt recognize that i was wearing it all day. I adjusted it all fay and once i moved my arm it would move and bunch up.,Negative
Este producto venia totalmente en mal estado.tengan cuidado hacer pedidos de este tipo,Negative
"Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.",Negative
Not what I thought it would be,Negative
I got this as a Christmas gift for my best friend and I am very disappointed with the way it looks.,Negative
Just realize you won’t know it’s in a package of you ordered other things. I threw this out because I didn’t realize it was in a package with other items I ordered. What a waste of money.,Negative
Nothing more than a xerox copy.  Not worth more than $1.99.,Negative
Them is flexible but way too small to put in ear maybe for a baby but not an adult,Negative
"I loved these when they first arrived, but after just two weeks of wear, they were so badly tarnished that a silver polish cloth wouldn't remove the tarnish. When I contacted the seller, she recommended cleaning them every time I wear them and keeping them in a sealed plastic bag when I wasn't wearing them, but the tarnish is so bad they're unwearable. Though I'd asked for a refund or replacement, she ignored those questions. Buyer beware.",Negative
"The Name beads fell off and the Names on Beads rubbed off within 2 Days. The clasp doesn't stay closed, so my Husband stopped wearing it because he would lose it due to falling (clasp doesn't hold) off several times a Day",Negative
I like it but the bead always slips down under my wrist ..  no Bueno,Negative
"Ordered 2T for my daughter's second birthday in June, and doesn't even fit now. Wayy too small. Graphics on shirt are also kind of faded. Wouldn't purchase again.",Negative
Clasp was so small I couldn’t work it,Negative
Does not burn well in a scentsy,Negative
I've bought a necklace from this company before and loved it so I thought I would buy another one and was sadly disappointed. The beads are small and very lightweight. I was expecting something with more substance than what I received.,Negative
Poor quality rusted on me less then month of having:( love the style of ring thou,Negative
I ordered the 5 pack set and wasn’t really impressed.  The price was reasonable. The Oder was great the first day then quickly disappeared. One to two days tops is all you can expect with this product an then you will need to change out the wax.  I’ve used others that lasted longer.,Negative
"Super cute, got them as a gift but wish they were bigger",Negative
The ball and opal already fell off.  Offer only about a week. It still has one left but that isn’t why I purchased it. And it doesn’t close properly hence why they fell off to begin with which pinches the inside of your nose constantly.,Negative
I truly wouldn’t waste ur money like I did. Maybe I mis read the reviews but I thought this was supposed to be a poster like quality or on canvas. It’s literally a piece of paper that I could have printed at home on glossy paper. I was so disappointed to give this as a gift. Thankfully she loved it anyway because I thought of her so there’s that.,Negative
Great design but was surprised when I received them that they were just printed on a slightly higher gauge of paper than what you use in your printer day today.  Would suggest a more sunstantial/stiffer material to resemble more what is placed on the doors at hotels.,Negative
Damaged my ears,Negative
Just paper - not framed  have to read description of this product it has no frame,Negative
"EDIT: As pretty as it is, the rug sadly does not last long. After 3 weeks of continued use, the name has almost completely faded. Would NOT recommend.<br /><br />It would've been nice to know if the ""s"" at the end needs to be added when customizing or if it gets automatically added when being made. Apparently it needs to be added when customizing.",Negative
"Disappointed. Ordered for a gift and was not going to open the package but am glad I did. The knot is visible and and too big to hide inside a bead. Not sure yet if I will try to cover the knot with a bead or send it back. Also, there is very little color variation in the tiger's eye so this is about 90% black (boring).",Negative
"Turned dark within a week of wear, not sure if it's silver. My ears did not have a positive reaction",Negative
"I am very disappointed.  This was going to be a gift, now not so sure.  I had this engraved  but this is so small  you need reading glasses to see inscription.",Negative
"I dislike it because it is falling apart. I use it at my back door, and it is NOT in the weather.",Negative
first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !,Negative
"Missing a jewel, turns green on the finger,  major jewel foggy not well polished.  I would not recommend this ring.",Negative
I really liked this product. But color matching was inadequate.,Negative
I couldn’t get the ring to stay on my nose. Waste of money! Just threw it away,Negative
"Stop selling this product - it is wrong, it does not have Crimea. Crimea is Ukraine. Be better than this.",Negative
"Look nice, but not absorbent at all",Negative
"These are made of very thin, cheap plastic. Was expecting something more substantial and more realistic for the price I paid. Definitely would not purchase again.",Negative
I was soo disappointed with the quality of these stickers. They looked like envelope labels. I had to tape using scotch tape to get them to stay on bubble bottles .I even used acholol wipes to make sure there was no film on bottles .,Negative
"I liked the idea of it, but very easily broken.  Very dissatisfied.",Negative
Definitely wasn't expecting the size 🤏,Negative
These are just photos printed on photo paper at a CVS. You could do this yourself for way less money.,Negative
Horrible quality ! Not worth the money,Negative
Such a waste. I literally found better towels at Walmart for .99,Negative
"Bought the ring for my fiance because it was advertised as natural free shape and she loves natural shaped pearls. Once recieved, the ring looks almost perfectly round, not even close to the natural shape shown in the picture.",Negative
"*UPDATE* After I gave this to my friend, she went two days and one of the horns fell off according to her. She wears pendants and such quite often so I don't think it was a matter of carelessness on her part. I haven't seen how broken the piece is but when it's a gift that breaks after just two days, it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift and I must say the customization in colors and design are great. I love the selection that's available and it really helps to make it a unique gift. At first I didn't know if it would be too big, since I've seen some 20 sided die that are huge, but it's a perfect size to display the dragon and die without being too heavy. Awesome work, you rolled a 20",Negative
Too large to wear,Negative
All black- none of those colors shown,Negative
Poorly made - clasp doesn’t stay snapped and constantly Falling out. I’d send picture but I lost one,Negative
"This ring looks & it is obviously been used fir many years , it is all oxidized& looks disgusting. It was sold as a New one.... You cannot even see the 925 marking at all . If you are selling your old rings you should say so!!!!",Negative
Not the same as the one in the photo,Negative
Do not purchase. I received a fake bracelet with fake “aquamarine.” More like colored frosted glass.,Negative
I didn't realize this didn't come framed!! But other than that I like it!,Negative
"Very small, and cheap plastic for the price. I didnt see any pictures that represented the correct type of plastic because even hard plastic is better than this gummy thing. Not worth more than like $6 at the most...",Negative
"ohhhhhh LOL did comedy serve my non reading self right with this purchase!!!.  Deciding to go with a Sunflowers type theme in my bathroom which was the reasoning behind this purchase that failed me miserably.  I saw the pictures of the sunflowers and completely failed to read any other description about the pics..  O snap!! Amazon delivers it and I'm looking for a  very small box, at least,  and a box I did receive if it's the size of a FedEx overnight envelope!!! I opened it and the the 3 pictures were like the flimsy 8x10's that come in the 20 dollar elementary school portrait package from back in the Dinosaur era.  I giggled uncontrollably, for a few at my misfortune and politely sealed the envelope back up and placed in the spring cleaning in the summer box!!!",Negative
These earrings are very beautiful and well-made — but much smaller than I expected. The images make them appear much bigger than they actually are. I feel deceived.,Negative
The words were micro small.,Negative
Was not color pictured.,Negative

"My husband gave this to me in memory of my Mom. It looked & sounded like it was silver in the description & picture, but it’s mostly black & cheap looking. Poor quality. Will return it!",Negative
"I find it very expensive, so it is the product.",Negative
The sticker started peeling off within a day after one use of inserting into a chip reader. The corners of the sticker need to be thinner so they don’t peel so bad.,Negative
"I thought this would be nicer looking, but the materials are cheap.  Bad purchase for the money.",Negative
"I bought this for my mom. She did lot like the lining because it made it hard to breathe. She cut it out and the pleats came apart. Now it’s a giant piece of fabric. It’s super cute, but just didn’t fit our needs.",Negative
I don't even know where to begin. Useless piece of metal.,Negative
"This is gold plate, not gold. Very, very deceptive advertisement. Only in the specifications do find out it isn’t gold. Metal type: vermeil. That is another word for gold plate.",Negative
It doesn't line up very well... and the stickers over lay oddly.  So I don't advise using on a color band that is way bolder than the sticker.,Negative
The part of this earring that was actually in my ear turned black and fell apart,Negative
This is definitely not the quality I would expect for a color print. Could have used my inkjet and saved some money!,Negative
The leather emblem came out good but the placement to the hat was not. It wasn’t glued to the hat correctly. It was a gift so I don’t have time to send it back. I added glue and did my best to make it stay on.,Negative
"What a disappointment upon wearing the bracelete. I secured it properly, went off to a wounded warrior fundraiser and when went to point it out to a seatmate- it was gone. How very disappointed it would come unclapsed so easily. I am very sad.",Negative
Very disappointed was not like I expected,Negative
I like the product but I wish it was bigger for the price,Negative
It’s cute but not quite what I was expecting. Over priced for just being words printed on card stock with no frame. I had to purchase a frame separately. I realized after receiving it that it doesn’t come with one but the picture advertised shows it in a frame.,Negative
1 Take an old junky wall outlet cover.<br />2 print out a collage of my little pony characters and glue it to said outlet cover.<br />Charge 9$ for this and claim a high quality product.<br />Literally could have made this myself. If I had known how little effort when into making this item I wouldn't have ever purchased this. Way too much money for the quality of this item. Very disappointing.,Negative
"I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.",Negative
Fell apart when I went to put them on. Terrible material,Negative
"I was pretty disappointed in these when I got them! The look of them is very vintage, but in the description it makes it sound like they are printed on a type of paper that will have that vintage feel to them but instead they came printed on glossy photo paper... kinda ruins the whole vintage/old look I was going for. Very misleading when they call it “Archive paper”.",Negative
"Amazing is spelled with a ‘z’. This is either spelled with a ‘r’ or ‘c’. I’m not sure which it is.<br /><br />I got this for my daughter and had my granddaughter install it to surprise her. When she sent me a picture, I noticed the error.<br /><br />Note to self: Always quality check your shipment before you gift it,",Negative
It was too big. I was expecting something very tiny,Negative
It’s Judgment. Not “Judgement”!,Negative
The product was shown as being bigger than actual size.  The nose ring is Very Small and is Definitely Not Worth the Money I paid for it Sorry to say...I was looking forward to doing business with company but I Definitely will Not be ordering anything else from them. ☹,Negative
"Just like another person said in their review, these earrings do not look like ametrine, but rather pieces of glass. I am absolutely embarrassed that I bought this as a present for a family member. My advice is go get some decent faceted amethyst earrings. I’m sure you’ll be able to get much better for the price that you’ll pay for these.",Negative
Waste of money. Leaves a red mark on your nose. Might as well get a real piercing and it heals up later,Negative
"I bought from this selling in good faith but when I got the peace I didn’t feel an energy. So I contacted someone who researches stones and she did some research on the company first and then she checked my stone out. She told me from everything she had seen with the website my moldavite was not real, then I gave her the stone and she confirmed it. I tried contacted seller for a refund and have been ghosted. I should have gone with my gut on this and did some more research. Don’t waste your money",Negative
The clasp is not secure.,Negative
"It looks like any other mask but it does have a larger chin area.  I don't see how some with a thick beard could benefit from this.  My husband has a goatee and he found the mask uncomfortable even though I ordered a large size.  After it was washed and air dried, the mask seemed to have shrunk and was wrinkly; I did smooth out the mask before hanging it to dry.",Negative
It was to large for my nose.. it didn't stay in place.,Negative
The script was beautiful but it did NOT want to stick to the wall. Very difficult to get off of the backing and already wants to peel back off of the wall. I don’t think it will last long!,Negative
Cute but not vibrant or glitter like it shows..,Negative
Very tiny and you cannot return them to order different ones.,Negative
waiting A long time for this and when it came was in bad shape Just looked old and beat up.,Negative
This product does not assemble as nice as the picture. Safety pin makes it look cheap. Very disappointed. Going in the garbage.,Negative
I like nothing I dislike everything,Negative
The picture doesn't really look like the actual ring.  The stone was pretty but the metal is not good quality.,Negative
"I ordered my regular size but they are WAY too big. The thong/strap is rough and felt like it may produce a blister if worn too long. Too bad for me, the seller refuses to refund my money since each pair is ‘custom’ created. Which means they snapped the cheap ‘jewel’ onto the middle of the thong.<br />Don’t buy from this seller!!! If you end up not liking your purchase, too bad, they keep your money!!!",Negative
"While I like the colors, the earrings are bulkier next to my face than I had hoped.",Negative
"I ordered a couple of months ago and the product description says push pins are included at that time. The product didn’t include any push pins and seller apologized for the incorrect description, but didn’t send it. I am disappointed and need to order push pin from other vendor. Also, the map of USA doesn’t have USA written anywhere which is also weird.",Negative
The velcro on the strap doesn't  stay together,Negative
Very cheaply made. Poor quality for price I paid.,Negative
"To keep these in place you need to do the following:<br />1- place the crowns on a shelf or mantelpiece<br />2- Pick up your crocs<br />3- Deposit your crocs in a firepit<br />4- Burn the crocs to ash<br />5- Enjoy your newfound confidence, you no longer wear crocs.<br /><br />Congratz",Negative
Item was faded & corner of the screen print was coming off the magnet.  Speaking of the magnet it was very cheap & barely held itself onto my bridge fridge.  Not worth the money avoid !!!,Negative

Not shani,Negative
"Color was as expected but the writing was very difficult to see, Couldn't make out much of the gold riding and it look like it was just rubbing off, but fortunately it was too late for me to re-order it from another company and how to use what I ordered guess you pay for what you get",Negative
This is just a photograph to be framed.  Not readable in this size.  Would be so much better if it was on canvas and a bigger.,Negative
Have only had this a few days and strings pulling apart in multiple locations.,Negative

Ok,Negative
"I mean it was only $8 BUT- it doesn’t smell good at alllll, it’s SO STICKY- might as well be rubbing honey on you- that’s if you can even get it to come out at all, and the scent is gone within seconds of applying. I would not recommend",Negative
Damaged product. I ordered 4 add on pieces and they were all scratched and badly gouged. I will not be using any of the pieces and would not recommend this product to anyone.,Negative

I have been in early childhood education for almost 40 years.This item goes against all sound developmental practice. It probably hinders walking. Children need to build core strength that happens through crawling. Children naturally do what their body is ready to do. Every time we put children in a contraption we hinder their ability to naturally develop.,Negative
Clasp broke within a week.,Negative
A little part on the inside of my finger turns green. Cheap,Negative

"This pair arrived in an plastic bag that was old and what appeared contained smalls holes all over as if chewed by something  and missing on one earring was the actual hook that goes through your ear. I ordered several pairs from this seller. Whereas the design part of the earrings are lovely, they are very simply made & poor craftsmanship. Several sets arrived with the pieces separated & required me to assemble them & tighten sections with needle nose pliers!? They are extremely lightweight as advertised which actually is nice. However there absolutely needs to be better quality assembly required on the sellers end. As is they are definitely not worth upwards of $20 by any means.",Negative
Not a mold for resin! Would probably be great for anything else but this was not a glossy finish at all!,Negative
"I actually bought this twice. The first time i bought it, i had it for about a month and then i realized part of the ring that i kept on the inside of my nose turned black. I thought maybe i had done something when i cleaned it so i bought it again. The second time i got it, i only had it for about 2 weeks before it turned black again at the same spot.",Negative
when i received the sweatshirt the first thing i noticed that one dogs name was in all caps (SARA) and the other was not (Opal)  then when i washed before wearing  it came out of the washer with fuzz balls all over it -i washed it by itself -really disappointed in the quality-wish i could return,Negative
The whole was drill not natural occurring stone and put on a cheap necklace that broke the day I wore it and was lost.,Negative
The necklace is really pretty so I’m probably just gonna keep it but I’m very disappointed because it’s not real clear crystal if you scratch it on glass the actual necklace crystal part chips off not the glass,Negative
No frame!!!,Negative
Very cheesy,Negative
"Even in the photo, this has a misspelling. Why would anyone purchase this?",Negative
I think the product worked but it was rather smelly.,Negative

Fake fake fake,Negative
The key word on the poster (&#34;tomorrow&#34;) is misspelled -- there is an extra &#34;r&#34;. The error doesn't appear to be related to the joke.,Negative
I over paid for this only worth less then 5 dollars cheesy,Negative
"My puddy/clay stuff hardened too quick. It was hard to get a good print. Not as easy as it sounds, or there's a trick idk. I work with animals for a living, and this.... this made me sad it didn't turn out the way I had imagined, I guess.",Negative
To SMALL!!!,Negative
This went right back to the sender.  I didn’t think to take a picture.  It looked like it was made from Resin and painted.  Terrible,Negative

"This earring didn't even last a week, and it was already tarnishing. I don't like this product.",Negative
I had this for two weeks and it broke,Negative
Purchased this necklace and it was lovely at first. Chain and beads lost their shine within 2 weeks. Would not recommend.,Negative
Big peice of crap will never buy again. Jewlery out of a gumball machine is made better!,Negative
Terrible earring. Once you get it in your cartilage you can’t readjust it be closed again so the hence are together. Keeps getting caught in my hair and coming out. Not practical at all.,Negative
This is what showed up. They don't even look like the picture. And they are tarnished!! Waste of money and not what I ordered!!,Negative

"The necklace itself is very cute. I bought it early for a Christmas gift, but by the time I gave it to my friend, the necklace was tarnished.",Negative
Comentó find out these items were at Hobby Lobby in the miniature section by the dollhouses in multiple packs. Not worth the buy. You can literally buy a 5 pack of the drinks for 3.99 gingerbread men are 1.99 for 6.. save your money very disappointed.,Negative
"It’s beautiful, but ended up ripping a fair amount of my hair before having to remove it entirely.",Negative
Came broken,Negative
"I figured a frame would come with this and you can barely see the lettering on it.<br /><br />Its a nifty idea, but I should of just stuck with my gut and just made one myself and spend about 2$ at the dollar store and that includes the frame.<br /><br />It is not as clear as the picture and not worth the money that I paid.",Negative
Complete waste of money.  Writing is so small it is worthless.,Negative
"It doesn’t fit in my car holder, it’s hard to hold to take a call. What’s really crummy is I paid for shipping to receive it, AND $7 to return it! Shame on you! It weighs less than 8oz!!!",Negative

for an anniversary gift turned dark second day she wore it- very disappointing,Negative
"I'm sorry to give a bad review, but unfortunately this product wasn't good quality. The wood box was cheap with a loose hinge, and the paint was acrylic with no sealant or buff coat. I could see pencil lines shining through the paint, and design lines were uneven.<br /><br />Basically, it was not worth $25. More like something I could buy at a craft fair for $7. But I think there's definite artist potential with better materials and a protective coating!",Negative
"Sent seller a message there was a typo, she acknowledged it, thanked me but didn’t offer to replace mine! Wow! Great she will fix for future people, but not the one who brought it to her attention!",Negative
"It is not as pictured. The headband I received says Happy Hanukkah all over it. Nowhere near as cute as the one pictured. Also, just FYI the under part of the headband is a weak thin strap. Actually looks more like a sleeping mask than a headband. LOVE the idea and last year I bought my sister in law one which she loves but the one received today is far different and disappointing",Negative
I wouldn’t buy this product again. Unfortunately it didn’t live up to any expectations.,Negative

Not framed. Just a piece of paper.  I returned it,Negative
"Bought these for my daughter's birthday. The print is cute and the shirt is comfy and breathable. The print, however, is already lifting in several places through the shirts. We did not wash the shirts before wear, as we didn't want to make it worse. It's super disappointing that the shirts were that cheaply made.",Negative
Looks nothing like what's online....,Negative
Color changes after short time,Negative
Use a better glue,Negative
All bows appear with 4 ribbons and I even paid extra for length and yet only got 2 ribbons - what a scam - what am I supposed to do with something that looks that ridiculous,Negative
"It is very beautiful fit very well my wrist but instead of 5 I just received 1, knowing that it was supposed to be a gift for 5 persons now I will sound like a liars only with one gift",Negative
Very pretty but fast to tarnish,Negative
I got this as a Christmas present and didn't open to check quality until after my return window closed. Black Sabbath has no R in it. Not happy. Simple typo ruined a fun gift.,Negative
I bought this product last year as a gift. It was beautiful but then discolored. This is NOT 16k gold as it is described. This is a lie and is fraudulent advertising. Not acceptable for amazon to sell.,Negative
Not what I expected.,Negative
I bought this about the beads are already turning from silver to a copper color. Very disappointed.,Negative
They forgot the jump rings so the earrings faced sideways. Wiring didn’t match up. Not very well put together.,Negative
Nice logo on the shirt but the fabric is way too thin and see through for my taste. It seemed thicker on the pictures.,Negative
"Print quality is poor and pixelated and the color is not what is shown here.  What I received was blue, not green.  Had to return.",Negative
These are slightly bigger than 11x14 and will not fit in a frame unless you cut them down. Can you cut a straight line? Me either. Disappointing.,Negative
"I can’t believe I paid for this! It’s a picture printed out on card stock, which I could have done in my classroom 🤔",Negative
These are painful to take out. They are made of cheap flimsy wire that bends way to easily. Sharp ends. Do not recommend.,Negative
No very deep. No worth to pay such money.,Negative

Garbage. Don’t waste your money. It’s like aluminum. I threw it out and asked for a refund.,Negative
Wasn't exactly what we were looking for.  It looked like a computer print out of the state.,Negative
If this ring is sterling silver why will your finger turn green? I’m waiting for two that Ive purchased and I don’t want this if my finger will turn green. False advertising to say it’s sterling silver. I have many sterling rings and my finger has never turned green.,Negative
You can make the exact label on your home printer for a small portion of the cost.,Negative
the names arrived in plastic instead of metal and two broke that same night.,Negative
It was just a photo that has to be framed. I wouldn’t expect that to be called “wall art.”,Negative
"I bought these earrings because they state that they are sterling sliver. I have a metal allergy and can only wear pure gold or 925 sterling silver. Within 90 seconds of putting the earrings on my ears started itching. Beautiful earrings, but I can't wear them.",Negative
Not the color in the picture at all. Very bright green.,Negative
"I bought these as a gift for a friend who showed me some &#34;Druzy&#34; ear rings she liked. What I received in this order is NOTHING like the ones my friend showed me, but about the same price. I didn't expect much for the price, but I can not say enough about what garbage these things are, especially compared to the ones I was trying to match. The pictures will say enough.<br /><br />First, where are the backings?!<br /><br />Second, the bezels are not &#34;rose gold&#34;, as far as I can tell, not even a &#34;rose gold&#34; plate. Maybe some kind of paint or stain?<br /><br />One of the center pieces has a chip out of it and one of them has the center piece set so far off center, you can see it from several feet away which is made even more obvious because the centers are too small for the bezels. (Same as the other pair I bought.) There's also corrosion of some kind on one of the center pieces.<br /><br />Finally, there's no way I would want my friend to actually put these things through her skin. The posts are NASTY. They've already got some kind of corrosion on them and they're not smooth. (Also like the other pair I bought.)<br /><br />I don't know if these are really &#34;handmade&#34; or not, but they look like something bought for 10 cents each in a bag of 1000 from China.<br /><br />(I bought a second pair in another color and it suffered every one of the same problems plus some.) Now I have to waste my time sending them back.",Negative
Laser engraved items aren't dishwasher safe.,Negative
This was OK but smaller than a regular sheet of paper. It was well made with important information for the year and laminated but smaller than expected. This disappointment was totally my fault for not taking diligence to double check the sizing. Great item if you don't want to hang as a large poster. My fault.,Negative
Made it to me I time but Didn’t really work as<br />I expected it to will not order it again,Negative
"This item was grossly overpriced.  It was simply a cheap looking photo copy, not a quality print. In addition, song lyrics were incorrect.",Negative
"Fine and functional.. necklace strand barely goes around my wrist, much less my neck, and to cut it would damage the flimsy loop that connects to the pendant.. returning with regret",Negative
Smaller than expected. The gold tone looks cheap. Sent it back,Negative
Could not us any of the six tiles purchased !! Tiles are a photo !  Not a glazed ceramic! For $15 each they sould be a durable surface!!!!!,Negative
I am very disappointed with this necklace.  I gave it to my wife for Valentine's Day and she wore it one time and the chain turned black in sections.  Very embarrassing.  The charm also faded from its original shiny colors.,Negative
"I needed these for an important project and was excited when they arrived (one day late) - but they don't stick!  They are all dried out.  Because I don't have time to return them as I need this project to get done, I had to use what I could by taping the dots on.  This is ugly and wasn't why I bought these!  I'm very disappointed in this product.",Negative
[[VIDEOID:7e0dc8d407ebabbabe1974da03181572]] Package came and I opened it and it looks like this. I hope it is better then it looks. It looks like it was used and repackaged.,Negative
Not good!<br />Fits small. The real jackets does look the same as the one in the picture.<br />Looks cheap.,Negative
Very light weight material. I debated returning it because it felt cheep to me.,Negative
Very cute! They seem extremely breakable.  I'm not sure if one roll is supposed to be bigger than the other but it bothers me...<br /><br />*Updated. One of the earrings broke after about 10 uses.,Negative
"No ...está si no la recomiendo la pihonia que es la pelota pequeña no es original , me llegó rota y el embalaje estuvo muy mal la bolsa rota y sucia como si era la última en el deposito",Negative
"Didn't like them at all. There was almost no scent of Patchouli, they were a waste of money. I wouldn't give them any stars, but it wouldn't let me comment unless there was atleast one star.",Negative
"Color is too bright, reminds me of the  sail cover for a boat.  The fitting is too lose, making wrinkles. Returning this purchase.",Negative
I liked nothing about it .,Negative
Be advised. It’s very small and thin! Not what I expected,Negative
These earrings are much much smaller than shown. They are made for kids under 5 at best!,Negative
Returns because the surface is very shiny like a gloss photo not a print,Negative
The scene was nic but left much to be desired.,Negative
The wire part was broken right out of the box. Not worth the money.,Negative
Engraving is blurry/smudged. Looks very cheap.,Negative
"I was disappointed with the shirt. I ordered a purple shirt. When I got it, they had used black letters on a dark shirt. The letters actually looked like iron on letters. I don't understand why light letters aren't used on dark colored shirts. I had to buy fabric paint so that the words can be seen.",Negative
Metal started bending and disfiguring after short time of gentle wear. Wouldn't buy again.,Negative
Super cute ring but did not fit was way to small I would go up a size if you are buying this,Negative
Pretty and innovative but not asubstantial piece of jewelry.  Small and lightweight.  Looks like it could easily break.  I returned it.,Negative
The metal piece is poor quality and very sharp. It cut my infant son as my husband was wearing it. The company was not responsive to my messages. I would not recommend this product or this company by any means.,Negative
it was worn for two weeks and it already tarnish. very upsetting,Negative
"The hook is the perfect size,  color and style that I wanted.  They seem sturdy. I went to hang it today and found out that the holes in the hook are too small for the black screws that were provided. I went to the hardware store and couldn't find any small enough in black. Now I'll need to find some black paint to put on the top of the screw after I install it. Makes my cost higher and a simple project take longer,  which is frustrating.  FYI - #4 × 3/4 is the size of wood screw that fit my hooks. I could have ordered a package of 100 from Amazon in the black that I needed but didn't want to spend that $11 for the amount of screws I needed.",Negative
I make jewelry for fun. It looks more polished than this particular bracelet,Negative
It was an alright purchase. U was a little disappointed in how faded the print was. It looked more vibrant online. It also looked like an iron on vinyl I could of made it at home.  I guess you get what you pay for.,Negative
"This is exactly what you see, in plastic on a flimsy piece of nylon string. The weight of the pendant isn’t enough to straighten out the cord. I’m really disappointed.<br /><br />I returned it and got some thing better at a lower price.",Negative
"Not only did I wait a long time to receive the item, it did not smell at all!!",Negative
"I am extremely disappointed in my order. I ordered 3 stackable rings and the names are not even legible!! The stones look like they are not set well and will fall out. This was for a gift, I wish it had come in a ring box instead of a plastic bag.",Negative
"Marketed as turquoise but when I received both pair, they are more of a green stone, not so much turquoise.",Negative
I thought I was getting 3 earrings - you get one very very very tiny pair for the price.  Not worth it!  Plus there were defects on the face of both earrings.,Negative
They broke . Did wear but once and they broke!!!,Negative
Very disappointed in this. For the price is Looks like it was rushed. Smudged paint and marks all over the wood.,Negative
They’re very thin like they could easily break & the name engraving is so small & thin you can barely see it,Negative
Significant problem with this order was that there was NO packing slip with details about order and NOTHING about the seller. I suspect this was deliberate.<br />Took ages to get permission for return. Very secretive seller.,Negative
"Bought them for our 10 year wedding anniversary and they are what I expected, very disappointed. You can’t see the writing on the glasses. There wasn’t an option for the color of the letters. In the advertised photos the font is dark but they are not. Don’t waste your money.",Negative
The angel wing was broken off when I opened it to look at it and then the small blue bead kept falling off because it wasn't secured on a ring. I cannot return it in time to replace it because I need in in 5 days.,Negative
"Product looked great, packaged great. Arrived with a broken frame and I sent 2 messages to the seller within 4 business days. No reply. Filed a claim with Amazon to request a refund since the seller couldn't reply. Only needed a new frame. Thankfully Amazon resolved, but my loved one is still out the gift that was for mother's day.",Negative
The chain part has turned colors,Negative
"Edit:<br />I discovered the finish on the links wears off which gave me a rash on my wrist. I cannot return the band due to it being six days past the Amazon return window. I am so disappointed and also out $30, which is a large sum for a retiree.<br /><br />I love my new silver Fitbit bracelet. It is stylish and comfortable to wear. I like using the clasp much better than the buckle on the plain black band that came with my Fitbit.<br /><br />I did not find that attaching the bracelet to my Fitbit was overly complicated. Plus the seller sent extra pins in case of loss. Also, there were additional links to make the bracelet larger.<br /><br />I love my new bracelet, and I am glad I spent the bucks to buy it.",Negative
Im pretty dissapointed in this product. Not as the product description descrined. The small stones in the head of the stem are literally plastic beads. Tou can actually see the thread holes through the sides. The weight is terribly out of proportion. I wouldnt habe bought this if i had known what low quality this was going to be. Am definitely going to try and send back for a refund.,Negative
I got my wife one for Christmas. Within a few weeks the paper was peeling off of the board. I contacted the company and they were nice and sent another one. The images here show the second one. It also peeled off the board within a few weeks. Definitely not worth 100 dollars.,Negative
"The picture of the Rose Quartz ‘leather chain’ pendant was a lovely pink, and even though the product info indicated that the quartz you receive will not look exactly like the picture, I expected the ‘rose’ color to be beautifully apparent.  Instead, the pink on the quartz chrystal appeared white.  The leather chord from which the chrystal is suspended looks very cheap.  For some, the weight of the fairly large chrystal may be uncomfortable.  I would give the product ‘no stars,’ but the “submit” wouldn’t work if I didn’t.",Negative
"Elastic made , easily broken but nice and simple",Negative
"The description now says not a tin sign, but this item is clearly SEO'd to come up when you search tin signs because that's how I found it. My bad. Not worth $12 for a piece of paper.",Negative
"The print of dog paws with names is absolutely the best idea, so sweet. The tshirt quality is terrible, thin, and cheap. If the shirt material was quality it would be a perfect 10. I'm afraid to wash it because I am sure it will shrink and fall apart.",Negative
Poor Quality material.,Negative
Don’t like how it feels.,Negative
"This piece is not as pretty as the picture.  It reminds me of something an old woman would have.  It is a nice size, but just nothing special about it.  Nothing like the beauty of the photo.",Negative
"It does smell decent! But the package comes without any direction of how much to use or the ingredients inside. I did try it, using like I do my other bath salts and there was zero fizzing. It also had a hard time dissolving. It kind of sat there lumpy until I mushed it around. Turned the water a murky color. I thought it was lame so I added more water and bubble bath and I had no bubbles which usually work fine. It's like it sucked all the joy from my bath. I wouldn't buy this or give to a friend.",Negative
"A little disappointed. I think I’ve had this product for 5 months, and out of nowhere the latch broke on it and I had to Toss it.",Negative
"It’s not what I expected, it’s too small to give us a gift unless it’s for an infant. The quality is great but everything else is not worth the money and it’s ridiculously small to be considered a gift.",Negative
Nice but be aware that if you order from this company and you want to return something-its a 20% restocking fee and the customer pays for the return back. IMO not worth it. Product is just OK. Not really great.,Negative
It keeps a few needles accessible but it is too small for large projects.,Negative
"Very pretty, uncomfortable to wear, kind of pinches my ear. May not pinch yours though !",Negative
"I thought the bracelet was really cute. However, within the first week it got caught on something and the clasp broke.",Negative
I bought 2 of these because I really liked the colors and the look.  Within 1 minute of wearing the first one it broke and can not be fixed.  I haven't even tried to wear the 2nd one because I fear they will both break.  Don't Waste Your Money!,Negative
Smallish and poor print quality.,Negative
"Asked for “blue” birds. Company paperwork said, “blue” for birds. The picture has 2 blackbirds sitting in tree. It looks like a picture for a Wake instead of my 50th Wedding Anniversary. I’m still crying.",Negative
This was a Matchbox car with a line and a mini tree tied with a ribbon to the hood. Bought a different ornament from someone else.,Negative
"I ordered a purple bracelet like the picture above for my husband, it was suppose to match his watch. I received a light violet almost see through color. I'm disappointed!!!",Negative
"Watch out, being deceived. They use a dark background on this picture so when you actually see them they are a very expensive clear beer glass.",Negative
"This product asked for 6 extra dollars to arrive a blue gift box, and instead it came in a trashy looking bland cardboard box. I have better and cuter gift boxes lying around my house I could've used, so that was a major let down.<br />And the chain came knotted and I couldn't unknot it! I tried gifting this to my mother but even she couldn't get it loose.<br />Also some of the engraved letters have a bit of a smudge.<br />Please, please, please save your money and look elsewhere.",Negative
I'm giving this product two stars because in theory it was a great idea. However the reality of it is there's more bulk that's easier to catch on objects and the tape gets sweaty which is detrimental to keeping the omnipod on.,Negative
The bottom corner was imperfect and the word 'and' was added right after the Grooms first name and should have been between the names.  Very unhappy with this product.  i do not recommend this seller.,Negative
"UNFORTUNATE! A friend sent item specs/ model info.  So ordering it for her I didn't pay attention to item.  YEARS AGO I MADE A GIANT MISTAKE WASTING TIME SELECTING SIMILAR SQUARE UNIT.  IT STUNK OF LEATHER SCENTED SHALLACK,, BROKE APART,. FELL APART.  TORE APART.  DREADFUL CRAP MERCH!",Negative
"No way is this worth almost $20. The tune is off, the quality is.. junk-ey. It has to be hand cranked continuously to keep playing (CAN NOT BE WOUND). I honestly wish I would have just bought the brown one for 1/2 the price",Negative
"It is cheap, tacky copier marks all up and down it. Terrible. Avoid.",Negative
Chain broke after wearing it for a week,Negative
Can't get it around my neck. Very disappointed ☹️,Negative
I love the saying but there is one drop inside the circle of the mug print that makes it look like a boob and not a coffee stain,Negative
Too hot!,Negative
"Great for a one time wear. Love the design & personalization, but started coming apart after first wash.",Negative
They are to soft,Negative
The pendant is very nicely engraved and my boyfriend loves it however the chain broke in 2 places already and it has only been 10 days since he started wearing it. For the price of this product I expected a lot better quality and am very disappointed. I will be keeping keeping the pendant but will be replacing the chain for a better quality one.,Negative
I purchased this shirt to wear to the New Edition concert this upcoming weekend. Five of my sisters purchased the shirt too. We are disappointed. We paid for expedited shipping only to receive a faded black Glidan brand shirt with no sparkle. Please do not buy it! Fake shirt!,Negative
Is not a stone I have no idea what this is I like a return,Negative
"Very pretty bracelet, not very good quality though. Bought it for my daughter and changed color with less than two months use.",Negative
"The glass is quality made glass, but it is difficult to read the saying when glass is not full. But we are unable to read it when glass is full. The saying was the most important of this glass .  It is what attracted me in the first place.  I was extremely disappointed when I filled the glass and gave it to the person as a gift and they couldn’t read it☹️",Negative
I ordered a “E” . I personally thought it was pretty but everyone else I showed says it doesn’t look like a E. It’s been 9 months since I bought it and it’s still not on the wall since I have no clue how to properly/ safely hang it over my baby’s crib without putting nails it through and nail holes in the pink wood letter .,Negative
You could print these off at your local CVS - absolutely nothing special for the price,Negative
Lettering was off and not symmetrical. Disappointed 😞,Negative
product is to small no like picture,Negative
I bought this for my bedroom but could not smell it. I moved it to my guest bathroom. A 6 x 6 bathroom…. You still cant smell it! Way too expensive to not work. I can’t return it because I threw out the top and the box! Don’t buy it.,Negative
The Dragonfly broke after one wear.,Negative
I love it it looks great. I get tons of compliments. However I hav only had it a month and it is tarnishing. The underside of it looks terrible. Very disappointed.,Negative
Turned out a lot smaller than I was expecting especially since advertised that it was for a Yeti Tumbler.,Negative
Poor fabric quality. Order a M cause that's my husband size and it's bigger like 2 sizes more. Disgusting with this order M and comes like XL,Negative
"This is the most irritating purchase I think I’ve made, the pieces have no structure to them they’re super fragile, the finished image above is nowhere near what you are purchasing (seller needs to remove that image), half the prints don’t line up with the small rod assembly holes, they’re no instructions whatsoever, and you have to provide your own assembly rods, the butt stock is literally 2 different sizes, this seller needs to seriously address the quality of their products and redesign most of them, this isn’t the only item I’ve been severely disappointed with from them, you’re much better off going to an Etsy shop and spending a bit more money, it will be a much better investment.",Negative
To small,Negative
The scent is super strong and very overpowering its the only thing I could smell in the house and everyone in the home complained about how strong it was.,Negative
"I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters ""machine engraved"". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.",Negative
Too small,Negative
This item is very small. Not like picture at all In Size. My 10 year old wouldnt even wear it due to size.,Negative
I would have loved it if my name wasn’t so dark on the rose gold.,Negative
"STOP!!! Ring stone was nothing like the picture.  the design is very chunky and funky.  Does not give refund because they say it is a custom order because you request a size.  Was promised a refund by Amazon, still waiting.",Negative
I was super excited to get a custom shirt.  Super soft!  But didn’t even get through one day of wearing and the material started to peel/fray.  The letters look great.  But I feel maybe I should just frame it and make it a decoration near my workout area instead.,Negative
"I was so disappointed with the washed out color.  I saw the nice green color online and thought I would receive the same. To my dismay, the earring color was a light washed out green.",Negative
Item is smaller than shown in the picture. It broke after a few days of my daughter wearing it. It was a complete waste of money.,Negative
"The shirt and graphic quality are good, but beware that you don’t get to choose the color of the balloon dog. I thought it would be some solid color like all the examples but I ended up with a solid white one that I would never have chosen. I can’t return this so I’m going to try to color the balloon somehow.",Negative
"Very small, and cheap plastic for the price. I didnt see any pictures that represented the correct type of plastic because even hard plastic is better than this gummy thing. Not worth more than like $6 at the most...",Negative
"Nice color, but did not come on a wooden spool as pictured.",Negative
House Stark Symbol was already coming off when it arrived at my house.,Negative
I’m not sure why this is even a thing. It doesn’t break down buildup. It has a color so it’s making you believe it worked or works and it really ain’t doing anything,Negative
I am very disappointed by this product. The letters are not as neat as they pictures show. My daughters name starts with a M and the M has thick mountains which make it look very cheap. I am upset with myself for spending this much money on this.,Negative
"I was denied a return on this bracelet. Reason given…”Resized or altered jewelry cannot be returned.” I assume the symbol I selected to be embossed on underside of bracelet is considered an alteration. However, you have to choose a symbol or word to have embossed before you can place the order. Do not order if you think there is any reason you may want to return it!",Negative
Comfortable and fit great but the letters are falling off after one use.,Negative
I received this as part of a gift box in August.  Loved it so much I ordered just this salt scrub.  It is NOT the same as what I received in the gift box. This salt scrub smells horrible and left my hands feeling sticky.  Not happy…especially for the price I paid.,Negative
Was soooo disappointed! I wanted a lavender eyeshadow to bring out my green eyes- but I have always been allergic to red and blue dye....so it trashed my eyes....I ended up rubbing it all off...also it was very light blue,Negative
Its not even a poster.,Negative
"This is not a tin sign like expected , it's just the meme printed on a piece of medium weight plastic or paper.<br /><br />What do I do with that? love the wording and graphic - just the product was very disappointing",Negative
Krystal fell off I wasn’t very happy with the quality and look cheap,Negative
Much smaller than pictured,Negative
"Can't get either one connected, flashed colors but nothing else is working, very sad I was really looking forward to the working. I did buy them in a pair hoping it would be easy.",Negative
Very difficult to write an envelope - color of paper much too dark,Negative
I felt disappointed! Very poor construction and wood isn’t really a hard wood. More like birdhouse wood. Small sign and the color is way off from the picture.<br />Don’t waste your money!,Negative
"I wanted to use the pictures for the bathroom. The simplicity of the design is nice, but I’m not sure if it fits what I wanted. Either way, I have it but have not been able to use it.",Negative
Did not fit nice<br /> Needs to stretch then I would like it better. Good color.<br /><br />I'm in,Negative
A week late and a dollar short chinnsy for the money,Negative
This bracelet was so delicate and beautiful although not very durable but I wasn’t looking for that. But when I opened the box it was a very small child size. I have small wrists but this literally fit on two fingers. I have it to my 3 year old Granddaughter and it fit her perfectly.,Negative
"took forever to get,but nice.",Negative
The color is much darker than the pic.  It looks black on my nails.,Negative
Waste of money,Negative
"Pretty ring, butI had a bad reaction the whatever metal the ring is made out of- it made my bones hurt! I can't wear it.",Negative
This product is not the quality of a similar product that I have purchased elsewhere in the past.  The glitter is only on one side of the words.  The vinyl is very thin and floppy.  The wooden skewers that are glued to the vinyl of course get cake icing on them making you wonder if it is safe to use again.  This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.,Negative
Left marks on my skin and made me green/brown/red,Negative
Looks cheap doesn’t match our previous stockings is stickers not embroidered,Negative
Juliana,Negative
The cork screw is really big. You can see it coming out of your nostril and it’s not a good look. The design is nice but unfortunately I can’t wear it because of how big the wrap around piece is,Negative
MAKE SURE YOU READ DESCRIPTION. The order DOES NOT match the pictures of the product so don’t base yourself off of that. This product is NOT FRAMED. You literally get PAPER PICTURES. Paid 45$ for PAPER PICTURES. DO NOT ORDER. Not to mention they don’t accept returns because they are “customs” yet you don’t have a choice to choose out of different pictures so I don’t see what’s custom about it. Hilarious. I hope you go out of business since you like to just rip people off. :) PS you should think about putting a realistic picture of the product... oh wait you can’t cause no one in their right mind would buy. Lesson learned,Negative
"Item was very small and very thin. I appreciated the item was wrapped in a simple drawstring bag-which is sufficient for shipping. It is not useful for much more. But, it eliminates one extra plastic bag",Negative
I was sent wrong item.<br />So pissed!!!!,Negative
Very hard to separate the paper to stick the images on the wall,Negative
Probably not worth 1 buck.  WAY over priced!  Totally ridiculous.,Negative
"There's no way to verify the saying is printed on ""original"" paper. The product for framing, is paper thin! The print against the background only distracts the eye from the mesage.  I do not recommend.",Negative
The clasp broke on the very first day of wear not constructed well.,Negative
but not when they are so small they go thru your ear.,Negative
"This is a cheap (and I mean cheap) drug store photo print. There is nothing ""handcrafted"" about it, and by made in the USA they clearly mean went to the closest walmart to get a quit print out done. It's not even on quality paper.<br /><br />Avoid the hassle and purchase a decent product from a decent seller.",Negative
The made is ggood but the big stone in center looks like plastic and is a very big ring as a whole..if you are in USA please be careful to order anything from there bcaz if u wana return any thing you will have to pay shipping lot more than cost of the item and run around of the seller,Negative
Couldn’t wear it.  It hurt and after wearing it for 1/2 hr I had to remove it and noticed a dark pin hole mark being to form.  Haven’t wore it since.,Negative
"First of all there is no silver stamp 925 on any part of it ,and I am allergic to any metal except real silver 925 ,after I try it got rashes on my chest and neck area.I am very disappointed try to return it ,it says this item can not be returned for no reason .",Negative
The ornament was blurry. The lights and writing in the picture are crisp and clear and when i received the ornament it seems blurry and not nearly as clear as the picture. : (,Negative
"It was not what i needed, unbelievable not what you think very poor workmanship . They look like Assembly line made The leather looks like plastic , it arrived on time.<br />Gregory Culbertson 7/19/2019",Negative
It’s a beautiful cut but the stone does not look real,Negative
"I hope the maker of these decals is working on an easier way to adhere them to a wall because I can't imagine they get many repeat customers. The designs are beautiful, but the process might have you second guessing your decision. The process takes days: 1. flatten decal for 24 hours 2. Apply decal to wall and let adhere for 24 hours 3. SLOWLY and CAREFULLY remove backing w/out ruining decal: at least 1 hour. It looks good, but it was rough-going several times. Review update: after all that effort, the decal is bubbling up and not sticking in some spots. I removed a star as a result. Buyer beware.",Negative
Did not fit my Fitbit Charge 3<br />Clasps are the ones for Charge 2 - even though it states Charge 3 on package<br />It’s going back because it doesn’t fit,Negative
This item was plastic  most all motorcycle signs are metal,Negative
Definitely. Not sterling silver.,Negative
"I didn’t realize it’s a hoop that has no clasp. It’s trash, don’t waste your money",Negative
After only one washing the white image is peeling off of the shirt.  Very disappointed.,Negative
It was cute but very small wanted to hang on the wall but to small not worth the money,Negative
Do not buy this product it’s very misleading<br />The description says 12 but you only get 1 cup! This was suppose to be for my birthday dinner as party favors!!! Will not be ordering again and I will be returning this product as well!!!  I only gave one star just submit the comment!,Negative
Can’t breathe with these,Negative
"not durable, overall poor quality.  Over priced for what they are.",Negative
I love the product but I ordered 2 and one had the wrong year penny. When I contacted the seller she said she would make it right and then ghosted me.<br />If I could give no stars I would just for the lack of professionalism & respect.,Negative
These pictures are not 8x10. They are smaller and so they don’t fit in an 8x10 frame properly.,Negative
Pretty disappointed that it didnt come framed..,Negative
"I happen to love this necklace, but it broke really easily. I don’t think it’s worth the money I spent on it and I’m not able to return it because it’s past the 30 days so that is definitely disappointing.",Negative
This was a great idea but very disappointing because it’s SO cheaply made. It’s very soft and flimsy and will not keep its shape. Would have been great if it was better quality. Not worth the money being charged for it.,Negative
"No vino igual, no tiene el número 10, aparece un número seis en letra",Negative
Very poor quality - it fell apart the same day we received it.,Negative
"Way to small. Don’t follow her sizing guidelines, order 3/4” bigger. She is very unreasonable and will not honor returns or resizes even if it’s her fault.  Have to open claim and get refunded by Amazon.",Negative
This is smaller and less thick than something you could print at home. Does not make sense to buy,Negative
"I washed product as directed -twice, with no softener of any kind. Dried it and placed in the clean cage. Within hours parts of it were soaked and the debris such as hay, straw pellets and poop would not entirely sweep up because they were sticking to the wet spots. Within a day I had to change the cage back to the paper bedding I was using because it stunk. The positive points are - it is a very cute print, is well sewn and thick. It was a generous size with some material left over.",Negative
They seemed cheap and much smaller than shown,Negative
"It fell off and was list the first time I wore it. But right up until then I loved it. I just had it on a thin blouse, so nothing was tugging. Must be a tad heavy for the magnet. I had ordered another design, but now I am too afraid to wear it.",Negative
Nothing special. Looks a lot better online than in person.,Negative
I love this powder and was extremely disappointed with this order. The scent is hardly noticeable and I really like patchouli. I will try again one more time😊,Negative
Only includes a single card and envelope in the order. The answered question is incorrect stating that there are 3 cards and envelopes per order.,Negative
Se veía muy hien y bonita pero como a los 20 días se rompio,Negative
Too Small to make a statement and<br />HOLDS NOTHING!!,Negative
This is a nice gift or would’ve been… if the box wasn’t destroyed and if it mentioned how small this pendant would be.. this sucks! I was trying to be romantic but how can I? Now i have to purchase a new one.,Negative
Terrible and very cheap looking,Negative
It's just a cheap print out from someone's printer at home on photo paper! What a rip off!!!,Negative
"I loved the necklace, it is the right length, and beautiful. The reason for the 1 star is I wore the necklace 1 time and that evening while taking the necklace off the lobster claw clasp broke.",Negative
"Received this as a gift and it already had makeup stains! Ewww.  Have had better bags for free with cosmetic purchases. Flimsy, small, and  cheap. Don’t waste the money ☹️",Negative
"I wanted to love these so bad. But I just couldn’t. They seem very cheaply made. Even when you open and close them then way the seller says to, they still bend and contort/disfigure the round shape. And then you can’t get it back to a circle shape again. And the ends of mine came tarnished. Just very unhappy with the product. Will be returning these sadly.",Negative
Flimsy cardstock.,Negative
"Bought two cat dishtowels and loved them.  I should have noticed the dimensions on this one.  It is huge.  Also, the screen printing is in the center section of the towel.  This makes it impossible to hang and see the design.",Negative
If it hadn't been curled (the tips of arms/legs) or bent - the midsections - this was a great piece and saved me the trouble of having to build it.,Negative
Gift for my daughter on wedding day and wording was done wrong  by you. I ordered because of how it read and living now reads Going.,Negative
"Sadly, this did have potential...if what had been sent looked remotely like the photos. Unfortunately, the 3D printing quality on the one I received was disturbingly pitiful. I ended-up getting the same type/look item from a different seller that actually took care and had proper quality control on what they allowed to be shipped to customers. I did attempt to reach out and did not receive a response. It is what it is and this went in the charity donation bin.",Negative
"The design and color of the sticker is great. But when I attempted to detach the sticker from the backing paper, it was the sticker that peeled up from the backing. I was disappointed.",Negative
"I bought this nose ring almost 2 months ago but have only been wearing it for a few weeks. It caused a nasty infection in my nose for a couple weeks even though I cleaned the nose ring with alcohol and used clean hands when putting it in. I noticed this week that it is already tarnished so I will have to replace this nose ring. I am bummed, it was my first experience with a hoop and I loved the look but it's not worth the infection and already having to replace it after only a few weeks of wearing it :(",Negative
It was pretty but did not last long.,Negative
This didn’t give the detox clean I expected. Hair still had build up after multiple soaks.,Negative
Appears cheap. The pendant is essentially a thick piece of plastic with a cheap string for the necklace. Wouldn’t recommend and already tossed it in the trash,Negative
Tag was for female owner<br />The phone number was off by one digit but still wrong,Negative
"It brake when trying to put it on and was tinny, not for an adult nose.",Negative
Very disappointed! Could barely see the lettering.,Negative
Won't purchase this again. Wish I would've noticed that it was cut on top. It was easy to put in though. It surprisingly hasn't came out yet either. Wish it was a snap ball like most cartilage earrings. It didn't scrape up my ear or anything either like some people had an issue with.,Negative
Not worth the money I'm returning,Negative
"Realize if you buy these earrings that they are VERY SMALL!  About as big as the end of a pencil eraser. More for a little girl.  They are pretty, well made, but small.",Negative
Vibrant colors but disap. Once I see them they are very overpriced.,Negative
There is not a single drop of palo santo into this bottle; what ever they put in the bottle smell disgusting. I don’t recommend anybody to buy this.,Negative
"It had a foam guard only on one side of it. It fit a little snug but was perfect, BUT!! It scratched up my grandmas headstone.",Negative
The color was nice but the feel and look felt cheap,Negative
The details are very nice but this is a super soft metal and it bent out of shape just putting it on,Negative
Fell apart when trying to remove it from packaging,Negative
"It seems so very strange to me that the company's that import jewelry havent gotten the word yet that American women's wrists are larger unless you are a small woman. When you place a stretchy bracelet on, it should move comfortably around and up and down the arm. No mark's should be left when trying it on and wearing for 5-7 minutes.",Negative
"I had thought it would be function too, bought these as a joke leading up to an actual gifting of an echo, but they are such poor quality I would be embarrassed to gift them. Returning them and won’t buy online again for a while.",Negative
"I loved the necklace, the way it turned out and the way it looked. I ordered in late February, It came by early March. By mid May the tarnish had completely worn off and my neck had a horrible reaction to it so I can’t really wear it anymore. This was only from moderate wear, taking it off before showers and bed. It’s kind is disappointing as it was my favorite necklace I’ve purchased",Negative
Broke the second time I wore it.,Negative
I ordered 3 names and I only received one?!? Very disappointed!!,Negative
"I’m hoping it holds up. It seems cheaply made for the price. I hope it is natural amethyst but honestly it doesn’t look it. It is large for a woman’s wrist, even on the tightest clasp it is very loose. Packaging was very cheap as you can see. So if you intend it for a gift, plan on buying a separate box to give it in.",Negative
Stone is cloudy and the chain tarnished within the first month,Negative
It is so hard I haven’t been able to use it . I don’t like it. And I’ve used other body butters but I’m just going to make my own.,Negative
Chain broke after wearing it for a week,Negative
Prepped my walls and had a fairly easy time sticking them on.. It looked awesome - then an hour later I come back into the room and see every last one of the stickers peeling off.. I stick them back on - several more times throughout the next hour.. They refuse to stay on : ( I end up pulling them down and asking for a refund.. I don't receive a full refund and am out $10 of the $65 I paid.. Not happy..,Negative
Quality is fine. I was hoping the gradient would be 90° from where it was actually printed. Makes this product unusable for my project. :(,Negative
"$13.45 for a very small triangle, u have to buy or have a collar as nothing is provided to put it on  with? Shop elsewhere",Negative
"So, I really love the styling of this ring.  And I was really excited to wear it, as the majority of the jewelry I wear on the daily is Sterling Silver. Real, 925 stamped, Sterling Silver.  This is not 925 sterling silver and should not be advertised as “sterling silver.”  It should be advertised as just a silver colored metal ring.  As you can see in the photo, the ring tarnished after wearing it one day. And, you can see that I am also wearing a Pandora bracelet, which I rarely take off.  I have never reacted to the Pandora bracelet or any other Sterling Silver jewelry that I wear daily.  The ring is very lightweight, which wasn’t a huge dealbreaker for me.  But false advertisement is a dealbreaker for me.  It’s really too bad, because it is a cute ring.  I’d have purchased more of these as gifts for friends. This was a first and last purchase for me.",Negative
"Great idea, wanted to like it, but it doesn't look as it does in person. The lips and mouth look huge, so it doesn't look right. Almost like something you would wear for Halloween since the lips and smile don't look natural, and are overly huge.",Negative
Both earrings broke after wearing them for 3 days.,Negative
Total gyp. No chain even smaller than shown here .https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795PDTFX/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_ttl_sol_0,Negative
"Love to support small business. I am a sewer and a pattern maker. Although these are beautiful designs, I was disappointed when they arrived. The masks are sewn upside down. This is a common mistake with masks patterns. People don’t know the top from the bottom. The maker needs to switch the pattern around. If you fold the mask in half and touch the ear parts together you can see along the food which part is intended for the nose. The deeper curvature is intended to fit the nose (the biggest part of the face). While the flatter part is for the lips. The maker sewed the nose wire in the side intended for the lips not the nose. They may have designed the floral pattern on the right cheek but the fit is wrong. The correct fit for the sewing pattern they used is intended for the floral pattern to fit on the left cheek. It is unfortunate that the maker does not know how to correctly fit masks to the face. Hopefully the maker reads this and corrects the make of these beautiful masks.",Negative
The writing on it was veryyyyyy small do not recommend,Negative
Loved this but it turned gross and almost rusty within a few months. Made my nose very irritated.,Negative
The toe ring is pretty but didn't last.  Broke in half right away.  Poor quality metal.  Not worth any amount of money to buy.  My granddaughter was very sad and disappointed.,Negative
"The bracelet was not as pictured, the silver beads separators were not on there and it is way to big for my arm.",Negative
I received a hoop that had no connector.  Had to push it as best as possible.  Ordering a real earring.  Needed this so my hole wouldn’t close,Negative
"I bought this because it is really funny and of course to put on my airpods, but after a week it is faded out and looks really bad",Negative
It was cute but dulled down very quick,Negative
"It smelled terrible, g. daughter wouldn't wear it!",Negative
Was hard to peel off and tore.  Couldn't  use it.,Negative
I need to get my money back.,Negative
Nice Image..colors not vibrant...fades quickly in wash.,Negative
"I had ordered these labels and they were printed incorrectly.  When I got them, I wrote to the seller who totally ignored my request for new labels to be printed.  Stay away!!",Negative
"If the actual size is 8x10”, the second picture is a fake. An 8x10” can’t be that size in perspective with the rest of the room like the one in the picture.",Negative
Too skimpy for the price!,Negative
The stone on the ring is definitely not the same as pictured.,Negative
"It was very fine and seemed fragile.  Also, I returned it 2 weeks ago and still haven’t received any refund.",Negative
"I WAS SHOCKED AT THE SIZE OF THESE EARRINGS!  IN THE PICTURE THEY LOOKED LIKE A GOOD SIZE, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THEM, I WAS SHOCKED. TO SAY THEY ARE THE SIZE OF A PEA WOULD CERTAINLY BE A JOKE.  TINY IS THE ONLY WORD TO DESCRIBE THESE EARRINGS.  THE SIZE YOU WOULD PUT ON A CHILD.  OTHERWISE VERY LOVELY.",Negative
"Not worth the price, is just a printed out picture that you could go to Walmart and do.",Negative
"It fell off and was list the first time I wore it. But right up until then I loved it. I just had it on a thin blouse, so nothing was tugging. Must be a tad heavy for the magnet. I had ordered another design, but now I am too afraid to wear it.",Negative
They didn't last one trigger pull  the first 2 broke on only 2 trigger pulls. I will not be testing the rest.,Negative
Necklace was very small and chain was very thin. Can easily break if worn. Was a waste of money and worth $1.,Negative
Was suppose to come with two necklaces. I only got one. Also pretty cheap put together. Broke very easily.,Negative
"I ordered 2 of the bracelets and I'm a bit disappointed to be honest. They are super delicate and very thin chain the ""personalization"" is so light  (I had names put on them) and barely etched in it can only be seen barely in the right light.  I wouldn't recommend these.",Negative
"I thought this would be like a poster or good quality paper Nope. It's literally a print on photo paper. Looks like someone did it off their computer. It's ok looking but definitely not worth the $12 I paid for it. Also, I thought it would cover in a frame but I read the description wrong. Pretty disappointed with this as it's a gift",Negative
"It was printed on felt, but I didn't realize it would be solely two dimensional.  It's not what I was looking for, so it was returned.",Negative
Don’t buy If you are expecting the stickers to look like the advertisement. Apparently if you don’t have the exact wording/ length then it’s going to be completely off centered.. and after being argued with that it was intentional I realized I should have just made my own mediocre stickers for this quality ☹️,Negative
Fran broken and canvas is torn,Negative
The shirt has great quality however the logo print is crooked and the shipping took forever.  I understand there are unforeseen impacts due to the Covid-19 but the label was created and I received a shipment notification over a week before the item was actually shipped out.  The seller did explain they've been behind but I was even more disappointed the logo wasnt put on very well upon receiving it today.  The shirt also looks like it runs small so I would size up if you consider ordering.,Negative
"The decal, despite proper installation, still perled up a section of the graphic. But I had to make it work.<br /><br />And no way this decal should cost thos much. Way, way overpriced.",Negative
"Very small. Mama Bear is barely visible and chain is flimsy. Not sterling!! Plated with what ""they"" call Sterling.",Negative
Was not happy I thought it came in a frame thee way it was shown in a frame. Misleading,Negative
Item is pretty BUT it's made awful..... I literally took it apart to try to make it look better... The back of it is so ugly no other way to describe it..... Just tied in leather knots.....,Negative
There has been an on-going issue with the return of these cuff links. It’s been far more difficult to settle this issue than it should have been. It’s been a month and I’ve spent too much time trying to fix this issue.,Negative
The price was very high for a little dish towel,Negative
"Very small piece ,hardly see the carvings. Not as pictured 😕",Negative
For me it is too difficult for me to put on,Negative
I accept responsibility for not paying enough attention to the description but it seems to be intentionally misleading that it comes with a frame. Both pictures show a frame and it’s not mentioned until the end of the description that it’s “frame ready”.,Negative
"Unlike the earlier reviews, my purchase came in a brown paper bag and not a cute bag that you could use to pack the slippers in when traveling. The shape is much less defined than in the photos, they aren't particularly comfortable (the heel is quite loose), the felt isn't consistent in thickness and the soles are black rather than matched to the slipper color as in the photos. I'm quite disappointed. I expect more for a $100 pair of slippers.",Negative
"This poster is wrong. Some of the runes are correct but it has some wrong ones, some that arent Elder Futhark and some that dont even have the corresponding letter under them. If you use this to teach anyone the runes you're going to spread misinformation so please don't. Zero stars because this was made clearly without a working knowledge of the Elder Futhark.",Negative
"Garbage<br />Not as advertised , not even close<br />With china return address<br />Could not and will not advise buying anything from the provider",Negative
Not happy about this product. Not what was shown in the picture Total misrepresented.,Negative
Received product late. Printed on printer paper and it looks like ink was running out. The package was delivered and paper is so thin there is wrinkles all over it.,Negative
"I bought this for my daughter’s room. I am very disappointed in the quality of the vinyl. It is cheap and thin and the adhesive on the back is almost non-existent. I have done vinyl crafts many times before and know the key is to work slowly. I spent an hour and a half trying to put this on the wall. The transfer paper was very sticky and it stretched and tore the vinyl as I peeled it off a millimeter at a time. Now the letters are distorted, the dragon is torn in multiple places and it’s already falling off the wall. I doubt it will still be there tomorrow morning. Don’t buy this product!",Negative
"I was so excited to get this and now there will be no time to get a replacement. So sad that this wasn’t checked before it was mailed out. Very poor quality control, it’s already way overpriced. I would have been happy nonetheless had there not been an obvious defect!!!",Negative
I should have gotten a set of three necklaces. I only received one.,Negative
As a bodybuilder this is a horrible design when the photos misrepresented itself!,Negative
"The size wasn't  right, I ordered a size 11 but it was a small size, also  the band was thin as paper,  just not happy at what I received.",Negative
I should have read the description better so that’s my fault.<br />However to charge someone this much money for only a poster 8x10 print and no frame that’s ridiculous<br />1 photo paper by itself isn’t that expensive<br />2 ink per paper isn’t that expensive<br />3 you can go to the dollar store and get a frame or order them in bulk especially if your running a business.<br />4 cute picture and is going in my bathroom<br /><br />This would just look so much better if it were painted on a piece of wood and more rustic rather than a glossed photo paper.<br />Now I have to find a frame.<br />It’s just a little much. Now satisfied,Negative
They kill my ears!,Negative
Disaapointed as you have to have the neck of a 3 year old for this choker necklace to git. The pearls (beads) are pretty but the chord is way to small.,Negative
Looked cheap,Negative
The only thing handmade about these is that the 'artist' hung a charm from a hook. I bought these charms and they are mass produced.,Negative
It’s definitely cute but not worth it when it looses a stone after wearing it once for a few hours. Not worth the money,Negative
"The strap itself is very good looking.  I got several of these, the other two had velcro closures and this is a slip-on.  Within about an hour of wearing it on my ankle it was very uncomfortable.  Because there's no velcro to adjust the looseness, it rubbed my ankle a lot.  As someone had said, you won't get any sleep measurements with this cover, so will have to remove it from its pouch (takes 10 minutes to get it in the pouch and about 5 minutes to get it out) each night and put the watch on a wrist band to measure sleep.  It does a great job at measuring steps, but the discomfort on my ankle isn't worth it.  Suggest getting a velcro closure instead.  It is very pretty, though.",Negative
Not the best quality and you can’t return it if you don’t like it.,Negative
"The topper looked great at first, but the plastic is very brittle. While in bubble wrap in a suitcase the plastic split down the middle. We will not be able to use it on our cake this weekend.",Negative
I order the set of six and only got 4,Negative
Very disappointed small and painted very poorly. Hollow on inside. Returning this.,Negative
Size small,Negative
"Giving this a 3 because the fit was great, but as a bracelet I was using while working out, the fishing line used was just too brittle. The line snapped during a burpee and beads went everywhere. I've only had it for a month and a half. Pretty disappointed.",Negative
"the calendar is not accurate. the calendar shows 4/23/21 as a new moon,<br />aesthetically, it is attractive - just not accurate - would like a refund",Negative
"Horrible horrible! Looked beautiful and then about two and a half weeks in it has tarnished so horribly. It looks so bad! Complete waste of money! This was a gift for my 14 year old sister who just lost her dad, I'm so dissapointed",Negative
Pretty product but it came in ripped,Negative
This product is incredibly disappointing... my daughter purchased with her own money and was in tears when they arrived.,Negative
Doesn’t work and stings my nose. I’m hoping the coffee scented one works better.,Negative
Not a fan of the sparkle on these.,Negative
"The earrings are beautiful but, the jade balls fell off of the earrings posts after I wore them for 2 days.",Negative
Very does not total describe these earrings.  Miniscule  hoop earrings bend easily when try to put them in.. do not recommend,Negative
Thought the rocks glasses would be bigger- much smaller than expected.,Negative
I would gave 0 stars.<br />Not worth 14.99. You can’t really read it and it’s all smudgy no matter how much u clean.<br />Bracelet is cheap and looks tacky on you.<br /><br />Would never buy this again.,Negative
Very small. Would’ve been awesome if it was the size of their other coins.,Negative
The quality of the print did not match the image sent. The image was fuzzy and grainy. Similar quality of printing this at home with basic card stock.,Negative
"Cheap, easily bendable, hard to put in and remove. Not worth the price.",Negative
"This thing is a cheap piece of crap, looks NOTHING like the picture, and doesn't even close just flops around. Maybe the sent the wrong item? Willing to give the benefit of the doubt, but very disappointed.",Negative
They are so pretty but poorly wrapped for shipping. I had such high hopes.,Negative
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PAINT PORTION. highly disappointed.  You can see what looks like finger prints and shoe marks.,Negative
"Well after reading everyone's reviews about the size 16"" I decided to go with 18"" . Mine is tiny !!! The picture of the 16"" reviews are large. I am quite disappointed in the sizing . I just redid my daughters room and wanted her name above her bed but this is way too small . :(",Negative
"I am very disappointed in this product. Not only Did it break when I took it out of the box, but the S on the end of Sullivan’s, is jagged. I would really like this product replaced and made correctly.",Negative
Mala calidad!!! Dinero perdido,Negative
"Totally not worth the money. My daughter bought me some really cool carved letter tiles for less money. When I requested a return they denied it as my item was “personalized”. Silly me, I thought they could re-sell the letters. Feel ripped off.",Negative
Just printed paper of flowers waste of money.,Negative
It is not real moldavite,Negative
Once the shirt was washed in cold water and hung dry all the ink and the face on the shirt faded away and some actually completely disappeared. So you can no longer make out if there is a face anymore and you can’t read the name. Complete waste of $29.00.,Negative
Broke trying to get it out of the box.,Negative
fell apart in less than a week,Negative
"The material is cheap. It’s made of cardboard and foam. Not sturdy, it’s not metal nor wood. Extremely expensive for what it is.",Negative
"These are not going to be the high quality you want them to be. They have a cheap look to them. Not sure why I’m surprised. And I never got to wear them as they are packaged so light and small that you almost think they sent you an empty package. Mine got thrown away, thought it was a wrapper.",Negative
Chain very thin and broke easily without much stress. Broke at links too not at clasp so I wasn't able to repair. Had to return.,Negative
"Okay but hard for the beginner.  The video online is subpar because she only shows a limited amount of the steps and personally when I got my kit the outline of it was so light that it was so hard to follow that I ended up putting it away for over a month now, it’s not easy it’s not a beginner course and if you make a mistake and try and pull the felt back out you lose the line that are drawn supposedly into the mat and you don’t know what you’re supposed to do anymore. this was a large amount of money to put away for this kid and I’m just not happy with it.",Negative
These pictures are okay they are small so you will need a mat inside a frame to make them of any size they're good in a small area like a bathroom or an entrance way other than that to use as any kind of Decor they're pretty useless. I thought they would be of a higher quality rather than just a print out on glass paper. I still haven't found a place to hang them yet but I haven't returned them because I do like the pictures themselves. Hope this helps,Negative
"very dissapointed in the size. very small, more like a mini pierogie",Negative
Took over 30 days to recieve....Item is nothing like depicted in the picture. Dont bother ordering. Not happy........1 star because I had to rate to review,Negative
See picture I need not to say more but it turns black,Negative

"Didn't realize I went over 25, so now I have an ornament signed with 1 1/2 names.",Negative
They are a little too narrow and long for my ears so they don’t stay in place very well and pinch my ear lobes.,Negative
This mask was much too large. I am not smaller than average but this mask was WAY larger than average. I could have covered my entire face from hairline over my chin. It seemed to be just one large piece of fabric with no facial contours for a better fit.,Negative
I disliked it because it’s absolute hideous…I didn’t have to buy it to know that!!!,Negative
"The earrings were close but not exactly like pictured. They are a very shinny silver metal base. The picture of Mickey is not sharp/clear with a plastic rounded bubble covering over the picture of Mickey. There is no border around the circle. To me, they were very cheap looking. I was going to return them by the seller required that I pay shipping to return them. I already paid the shipping to get them. Very disappointed, what a waste of money.",Negative
Does not look anything like the shark in the picture. Pretty disappointed with this sticker.,Negative
Smell was gone in less than an hour. Was greatly disappointed!,Negative
"Darker than I expected, the quality was low grade. I wouldn't buy these again.",Negative
What the title says. One is kinda pretty. One is a chunk of brown dirt some hints of purple in it. I’m thinking about returning these. I didn’t expect them to look as good as the photo but come on. Really?<br /><br />It was packaged well & they seem sturdy.,Negative
Seriously? What's it made of? The ashes of Christ?,Negative
Barely any pressure to try and tighten it a little (twisting rather than pinching like the directions stated) and it immediately bent to where it was no longer rounded and it’s not possible to fix it after that. . Hard to see in the picture but there’s an obvious sharp bend once it’s on and I’ve tried everything to round it out.. $10 thrown away unfortunately,Negative
These are basically shrinks dink’s with posts glued to them.,Negative
"Both shelves have terrible groves in them created when the wood was cut or sanded - and with the staining, were very noticeable. Then after measuring (instructions do not have measurements), the shelves do not stay on - they hang and are terribly flimsy. There's nothing to secure them. As I pulled one off, a metal bracket broke. Plus, both pieces are not the same size and since I'm stacking them, it's noticeable.<br /><br />I had to buy brackets to secure to the shelf and wall, and that's the only way I was able to firmly secure this on the wall. That means I only used the wood which is something I could have done from the start.",Negative
Colors were not as bright and colorful as pictured,Negative
"They are very pretty, but they do not clasp shut. I am unable to wear them, as they will not stay in my ears.",Negative
"These are not for deep tangles in the beard. Make sure to detangle your beard with deep moisturizing treatment or conditioner, for a soft smooth feel and ease of combing. The quality is very cheep.",Negative
Disappointed in every respect. Looks cheap. Poor workmanship.,Negative
"The design of this earring is adorable.  However, the description made it seem like it would be comfortable to wear 24/7.  I wore this to bed the first night I had it, and the wider part of the hoop pressed into my piercing. I woke up in pain and bleeding!  Now I know to just get a round hoop that can move freely in all directions.",Negative
not thin wire at all,Negative
This was a rip off u got of sold this for a quarter it's not what was said at all it's just a 8×10 picture not a plaques like was said I wouldn't even know y u would sell this for 13 bucks so sad I'm so upset,Negative
I didn’t realize this was only a picture of the sign and not an actual wooden sign so it feels like a rip off!,Negative
Received three belly rings but none that matched my order of an Opal turtle.,Negative
It did not mask the offensive smell it was bought for - it failed miserably.,Negative
broke after i wore it the second time....would not buy again,Negative
Cute! But broke the very first day.,Negative
I am very unhappy with this product. The earrings were so tiny . Very unsuitable for an adult.,Negative
Nunca recibí  el producto,Negative
This bag is so cheaply made. Plastic with some cheap material. Don't waste your money. It's so small and can't fit anything in it. What a waste of money!!,Negative
The font is so small it cannot be read. it looks as if it's just a bar I'm wearing.  Honestly I don't wear it,Negative
It feels like switch and bait honestly and poor quality of the stones and just looks plain nothing mysthical or life or spiritual. More like throw in the left over crap and put a metal wired on it and sell it at high price.,Negative
"The first tags we ordered were excellent...very high quality and nice job on the initials. When I ordered a set for my wife, she only wanted a single initial since her first and last name start with the same letter. When they arrived, the letter T was barely visible. I complained to the company that the size of the single letter was smaller than my tags with 3 letters. There response was...that's the largest size letter we have available and adding my paraphrasing...sorry you don't like it, but you're stuck with it since we don't accept returns regardless of whether you're satisfied or not. Amazon's A to Z return policy also exempts this product?!?",Negative
just a piece of paper,Negative
Broke trying to get it out of the box.,Negative
It did not last past two months. Burthstone fell out and chain broke.,Negative
The two little strips in the back that hold the top to bottom are very thin and will break soon,Negative
"IT STAINS AND FALLS APART WHEN TRYING TO CLEAN, USED IT ONCE AND HAD TO THROW IT OUT",Negative
It’s just a print out could do off the internet with a printer and some photo paper I should have read the reviews first overpriced for something I could have done myself for $3,Negative
"I originally bought two. One broke because it’s extremely fragile. Order another one & that arrived in pieces. Packaging that it was shipped in was a shipping envelope and the sign was wrapped in one layer of thin bubble wrap. This should have been shipped in a box, given how easily they break.",Negative
Was expecting an actual sign not a piece of paper. Never again,Negative
"While it would seemingly be a nice gift, the misspelling makes it clearly obvious that it is the work of a careless amateur. This is also something you could do yourself with colored paper and a laser printer. It's a nice idea, but it is certainly not worth the money.",Negative
The product looks very good. It's modern and the material looks like a good quality.<br />The problem was that it came bend. That's why my qualification is 1 star.,Negative
Can't get them on.,Negative
"The product is very nice, the print is exactly how it’s pictured. BUT make sure you look at how big it is!!! This is an 8x10 very small!! It’s not a poster size like I thought! I will be sending it back because of the size. You could print this out in photo paper yourself instead of spending $12 on a “poster” that’s printed in photo paper…",Negative
"Very small and tiny, wish I would have investigated this more.",Negative
This is a $25 headband that is supposed to have rhinestones. And there is not one rhinestone on here. It’s merely a piece of fabric with silver on it. If I could give zero stars I would. Of course I’m going to return this because there’s no way $25 is going to fly. I wouldn’t pay five dollars for this.,Negative
Maybe I missed something but the first letter is lowercase :( other than that love how it looks! This product sticks to the wall the way it should!!!,Negative
"These earrings are cute and lightweight, but smaller than depicted. Furthermore, the post was hard to open and it broke off the first time.",Negative
"The poster is advertised in a frame, I just found out that the frame is not included. I paid $22 for a 11x14 sheet of paper. Not worth it at all. There should be better communication that the product is NOT as advertised.",Negative
The edges seem rough and not very well made,Negative
It took so long to come and I couldn't use it but it was too small anyway. Very disappointed I could have got a bigger one for the same price at party city. I know better next time,Negative
The “paint” rubbed off and gave me an infection. Do not buy if you have sensitive skin!!,Negative
"I’ve now purchased this on two separate occasions. Nothing rough or outside of normal wear, but the chain is so delicate. Each time, the chain has broken (not the clasp, the actual chain). The Hamsa charm is so small you’ll be hard pressed to find a replacement chain or swap it out upon receipt. Just be aware.",Negative
Did not meet my needs at all.,Negative
Much smaller than realized for the price!,Negative
I could not wear this. Couldn't get it to stay in comfortably. Be aware this is not a hoop that closes. I needed a replacement since I broke my nose stud and can't get into and piercing place right now. I put this nose ring in my jewelry box and put and earring in my nose instead. would not buy again,Negative
Worst purchase i have EVER made on Amazon...Definitely NOT value for money....total ripoff!!!,Negative
Cheap,Negative
This product is not painted gold. It is unpainted boring wood. If you aren’t crafty or you just don’t want to do the work it takes to paint it…do not order this product.  There’s no way you can gift this to someone at least I wouldn’t. It’s an unfinished craft which is quite disappointing.,Negative
Decal missing part of the A and screw,Negative
I loved the idea of the ring and it fit perfectly just what I wanted however it was way off in color. The gold was too orange looking for my taste.,Negative
 ,Negative
At first I thought these were some decent decals. After 1 truck wash and 2 days of driving they peeled right off.,Negative
I'm very disappointed with the poor quality of this frame. There is glue seeping out of the corners of the frame. The corners are not flush. There are bubbles in the frame which give away that the frame is definitely not solid wood. There is a scratch in the frame.The engraved part is poorly done. The O is not round. There must be ZERO quality control done by this vendor.,Negative
Didn’t work as expected,Negative
Debussy said this not Mozart,Negative
"The printing is not sharp. As you can tell from the pictures, whatever process they use causes some bleeding around the edges of the letters. There are faint purple shadows.",Negative
"It is sooo cute, even the tiny box it came in was cute!!",Negative
Very cheap looking. And necklace is twisted and never lays strait,Negative
The stone on the ring is definitely not the same as pictured.,Negative
Literally rusts after one rainy day. This photo is after being outside for only one month. Such a waste of money.,Negative
I thought I was getting a amethyst bracelet.  This is what I received.,Negative
Too faded.,Negative
Decal was backwards. Can’t use,Negative
This stamp did not do as I expected.  The raised lines on the stamp are not profound enough to leave a good mark.  If I press down to soft I dont get a good stamp and if I press too hard you can read the letters or numbers properly.,Negative
My daughter plays softball and i got these for the coaches and i was extremely disappointed when i received it. I didnt realize i paid what i paid for a print out. I could of made this myself for way less.,Negative
Very cute shoes BUT the color cracked in multiple areas the first week. For over $200.00....I would never buy these again.,Negative
"This name tag is so rigid, it is completely inflexible, making it basically impossible to place on a stethoscope as advertised. By removing an ear bud, I could slide the name tag only through the metal section of my steth - it stops at the tubing and won’t go any further. This is the least effective way to tag a stethoscope - as soon as someone removes an ear bud, it will take &lt;1 second to slide out this name tag. Not worth it.",Negative
"This is poorly constructed and EVERYTHING is made of plastic. One would thing, at least, the engraved beads would be metal. It’s cheaply made and overpriced. Extremely disappointed.",Negative
Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.,Negative
"It’s super cute and dainty, but i had the worst reaction to it. I’ve never had an issue with different metals, but it caused my piercing to bleed and was swollen and painful the week I had it in. I had to cut it out of my nose to get it out. Would definitely not recommend this product.",Negative
Is not a quality product,Negative
The silver had turned black by the time I received it which was several months after ordering. The tarnish will not come off after cleaning.,Negative
Not worth $30 dollars<br />I’m sorry,Negative
Engraving was beautiful. Leather was poor quality. Great for seven year old with not much to put in a wallet.,Negative
i highly doubt there is very much comfrey in this salve.,Negative
very very cheap looking,Negative
Very hard to put on and certainly not worth the price . Wanted to return without allow . Bad customer service,Negative
"Make sure you look at picture! Frame is not included.<br />My mistake for not reading that, but still I'm very disappointed that they display it like that and all you get is a piece of paper that anyone could make on their computer.<br />Do not buy, you can make on your computer!",Negative
"Was expecting a more sophisticated knob, the bronze was most advertised. What I was sent looked much more chintzy. Not worth the cost. Very disappointed.",Negative
Smaller then I thought,Negative
"bad product, bad quality and service, very disappointed. It looks like it was packed wet and unfortunately came horrible and damaged.  we expected something better.  offer a kit hand for $20 can only be a joke..  really???? .  what a joke of a company.  don't buy don't buy don't buy",Negative
"its not really a map, its a photocopy.  you can not use it as a map.  do not waste your money.",Negative
My daughter ordered these and the first pair came broken with the flower detached. Tried a second time and the next pair was the wrong color (but it does say colors may very)but were also broken. For sure a low cost point and we will return for a refund so we are not out anything but would be cautious of purchasing.,Negative
"I do not know what this sleeve was supposed to fit but it didn’t come close to fitting our ninetindo switch.  I was too busy at Christmas to bother with this review or return.... surprised at this and  Disappointed ,!!<br />Doesn’t deserve any star...",Negative
I understand this has custom writing. But sizing was off. So wanted to exchange but it wasn’t allowed. Sucks that a shirt I want to wear on such a special day can’t be the size I want,Negative
"What a disappointment upon wearing the bracelete. I secured it properly, went off to a wounded warrior fundraiser and when went to point it out to a seatmate- it was gone. How very disappointed it would come unclapsed so easily. I am very sad.",Negative
Not as sturdy as thought it would be for the price,Negative
"Scam. Absolute scam. There’s a reason it’s ranked 17,800. Don’t buy. “Hand Made.” Wrapped a wire around a tube, cut a bunch of them off, put them in a box. You’ll look like a 12 year old. Unless you are a 12 year old you need to stop spending your moms money.",Negative
IBought this for my daughter she’s 7 years old and she thought  she would get all those pieces but she didn’t and she’s a huge LPS collector,Negative
The logo is grey not black.. just looks like crap.,Negative

"Not what I expected, poor quality, bad . Too small closure",Negative
"Cute, but faded horribly after only one week of being on the back window of my car. Pigmentation is basically gone.",Negative
"Really, really small.  Buyer beware",Negative
Not worth gifting to ANYONE! You can have stuff like this printed at Walgreens for $1.00,Negative
Very cheaply made and the one sided earring wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t turn around and show the back side.  Offered 20% restocking fee and I would pay shipping to return them.  They are in the trash now,Negative
"Bought this item for my wife's Bday. I love the idea but...<br /> I was very displeased with quality. The frame is a ""laminated"" to make it look like wood frame. Glass hides the ""paper printed picture"" $60 was a little steep for such a small picture size. I would have over looked the size had the quality no looked and felt so cheap.<br />Again great idea but failed on the quality... this husband failed to deliver on this one",Negative
"Of course not real Crystal, expected such for the price",Negative
The chain is very fine/flimsy. It broke the first time it was worn.,Negative
Thought I would ł love it but it isn't on the strongest paper and I think I could make a better design .,Negative
Fits small...,Negative
Image arrived creased. Printing is low resolution and fuzzy. Unsure if this is because source image is a low resolution or printing methods are subpar. I will not be hanging this on my wall.,Negative
"Dissatisfied!!!<br />i liked the concept. took it to my bench jeweler , he found 3 stress cracks in ring. so we scanned it , made a cigar band taper for pinky ring . we made a great mold and repoured it in sold silver , now i have a great ring. i ll put u in contact with my bench jeweler and you won’t regret it",Negative
"Very cheaply done. Not sparkly at all, looks like it was printed off a home computer.",Negative

It’s way too small for your cabin door,Negative
It is very complicated to get in and then reshape,Negative
"I am a big crafter so I’ve done items like this before, very cute, but very hard to put on evenly. Once I got it on, every night it bubbles up! Making me lose my mind. I would not recommend.",Negative
"Material had a soiled spot when received, return was accepted but I am responsible for cost to ship.  Cap size runs small.",Negative
This ring came rusty opon wear it rusted out even more not ever worth the money charged,Negative

My husband, who wears an XL, couldn’t pull it over his chest.  ( I ordered an XXL.).  It’s more like “ladies” sizing or “Junior” sizing.  Very disappointed but it is extremely cute!",Negative
The item I purchased is brown wood  and it said wood this is clearly plastic! Bought as a Christmas gift I am considering returning it. Very disappointed.,Negative
Ring split into two pieces after only a couple of weeks of delivery!,Negative
I was not impressed the print was just a print out and nothing spectacular,Negative

Broke within a day would not recommend,Negative
"No directions for metal only glass, but sold for mailbox",Negative
As far as historical value and conversation piece it’s ok. It should have more movable parts that you can read from a distance. Maybe light up the clock hands. Thanks!,Negative
"These are beautiful earring that we purchased for my 10yo daughter. Unfortunately, after one day of wearing one of the earrings made my daughter’s ears bleed. Upon removal, we noticed one earring changed color, as if tarnishing; the other did not. The other ear was fine, so it doesn’t seem like an allergic reaction, but like a different material was used. Throwing these away.",Negative
Super small!,Negative
El tutú es un blumer que le pegan al rededor el tutú,Negative
Didn’t know “vintage” meant overselling a piece of printed paper that’s not even a correct replica of Poland. I believe the Poland they were portraying on the map is before it was colonized even. Don’t waste your money on this item.,Negative

Not worth the money.,Negative
Looks like it was just thrown together.  Had bubbles all in it.  Looks bad,Negative

"Not worth the price! The five slime containers are OK, but you can get this cheaper. The extra are Halloween leftovers, which included an opened candy! Yikes!",Negative

Followed the directions to a t. Did not wash it after and wore it for a few hours. It was half peeled off by the end of the day on the first wear.,Negative
"Although this is a very simple nose ring it was impossible to fit correctly.

Was smaller the expected. was for a charm bracelet was too tiny,Negative
"Truthfully, it looked great when I first got it. Packaging was cool and everything. But wearing it is annoying. The build quality is sub par. It didn't stay on my wrist properly when I first started wearing it. I constantly had to adjust it and turn it around.  After a week of wearing it, the part of the bracelet that tightens and loosens it doesn't keep the bracelet snug.  It comes undone and I now I have to constantly keep tightening the bracelet because it keeps falling off. The roping pattern that's used isn't working out too well. I wouldn't get this again.",Negative

"Is too SMALL, you can’t put in your nose!",Negative
I ordered the small bottle and fell in love with the product so I ordered the bigger size.

I love the product but will not buy again until they package this properly,Negative
Does not look like the pictured tapestry at all. The colors are not as vibrant and the design is quite different. The seller should post a picture of the actual tapestry that is being sent out rather than one from online.,Negative
The description led me to believe that this was a pack of cards. It is only one card and they charge $3 for shipping. Not worth it.,Negative

Too much money for something that only lasted 3 days. Smell was just average.,Negative
I received bunny soaps only - very misleading post.,Negative

"I had very high hopes that the cost would match the produce, these are very very cheap. Flat metal glued onto wood dipped in green paint with clear coat. The pick makes them look so much more worth it. I do not recommend at all unless maybe for one time use. Very disappointed considering the price. Should only cost 2$ ....",Negative
"I was really looking forward to these earrings. I had been trying to mind something minimalist, so when I saw them I though, PERFECT! When they arrived I realized they only come with one pair not two. (Which was my own fault for not reading more carefully and assuming based on the picture used.)<br />When they arrived I realized they are not nearly as cute as in the picture. The earring back itself is very cheap and it pinches and rolls easily when putting them on, and doesn’t want to come off.<br />The earrings themselves don’t match. One is smooth and shiny like the picture. The other looks like a hammered nail head. It’s even bent.<br />I wouldn’t recommend these earrings.",Negative
This is poorly made and very flimsy.  One I ordered had wood that is inconsistently stained.  I would like to know if it is returnable as it is not gift quality.,Negative
I liked the clock but there was no way to hang it,Negative
"Looked very cheap , decided not to even give it to the mom",Negative
"Difficult to put in the Fitbit and it doesn't register your sleep. I threw it away, not worth the effort of returning",Negative
lost smell in weeks.,Negative
"It was nothing like the picture, it was super small, very thin and it looks like somebody made it from a bottle top. For $40.00+ dollars including shipping I expected more quality, not worth it, I rarely give bad reviews but this was a slap in the face.👎👎👎",Negative
"When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with ""Our Anniversary""  [our names] and  [date]  with  ""25 years  and Counting"".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  ""Magnetic"" pages is just a new name for old school ""press & stick"" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.",Negative
loved these at first but after about a week they began to rust and deteriorate in my ears.,Negative
"This was A fine slime, but it could use some help. It could not come out of the container, but it was not sticky! It also left a strange residue on my hand. So I re-activated it and it still had the same texture! I could have spent my money on something else!",Negative
Shame on me for not paying attention to the size before I bought it. If this poor kid uses this bag for trick or treating we will be done in 10 minutes. VERY SMALL,Negative
"After receiving this item, I found the charms were attached to the necklace and I wanted to put them onto another chain.  Upon getting the return ""approved"" I found that the price to ship them back was nearly the cost of the charms.<br /><br />I would not recommend this company.",Negative
"The product is only the little cloth face mask, not the larger mask shown in each and every photo. Admittedly, I should have figured this out based on the low price, but still, it's misleading at best and deceptive at worst. I do appreciate how easy it was to cancel this order.",Negative
"These are beautiful. The sterling silver that I got is flexible but they hold their shape. Only problem is that my earlobes are thicker than the curve of the earring so I actually reshaped mine with pliers. I adore them to much and I get compliments on them every single day I'm out and about.<br /><br />Edit: Had them for months, first time it's been out of my ear, buying another set!",Negative
Broke the first time I wore it,Negative
Broke on me in 5 days. The loop connecting the lobster clasp is very delicate and breaks with minimal pressure. Not worth 20 bucks at all.<br /><br />Please read my warning do not buy.,Negative
Misleading product title!!!<br />I bought this “sign” as a gift for a friend who’s been the hospital for over a month.!When I received it I was a little disappointed to see that it was actually just a photo and not a sign. I ended up having to purchase a frame to put it in which is fine but not what I intended on.  If they didn’t advertise this a sign I would've read more about it. Since I was looking for an actual sign (typically made of metal or sometimes plastic) I probably would not have bought it,Negative
I really enjoyed the look of the bracelets but was disappointed when the beaded one broke within a week of buying it. :(,Negative
"Appears to be just laser cut sheet metal, rough edges. no finish at all",Negative
This should be described as a paper bookmark because that’s what it really is.,Negative
The earrings fell apart even before I could wear them. Cheaply made. I want a refund!!!,Negative
"Nice bracelet, though a bit smaller than expected.<br /><br />Update: the quality of the thread is very low, just in a week the thread began to stick out from all sides...(",Negative
[[VIDEOID:751d3c64ea3b9aac31aacfada6036f27]] Maybe is my fault of choosing this font. Not too happy of how the ren show almost on top of each other.,Negative
"I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.",Negative
"The quality was very good - thick & the fact that it could be personalize, is a bonus. I ordered 2 for my brother & his wife. Unfortunately, it was very short. It would not even fit my neck and I have an almost thin neck. So, what's the use of a good craftsmanship if you can't wear it? Too bad, I could have bought more as a 🎁 since many were asking me where I got my leather lanyard (from another company).",Negative
very disappointed.  appear cheap.  very lightweight.  I am returning .,Negative
Just a piece of paper.,Negative
The most disappointing purchased I’ve made in my life. These are printed on glittery stock papers not even white like the picture advertised. There’s weird splatter spots on it too. Don’t waste your money. I’m sure printing it yourself would turn out even better.,Negative
It either sticks or it doesn't. I give up.,Negative
"This is not a toy, it cut my son’s finger open.  I bought this for my son’s 2nd birthday to help him learn the letters in his name.  It is nice looking but not a toy to play with.  The letters are not sanded down and they are rough.  The “t” is stuck and not able to be removed.  The sharp edges sliced my son’s finger open within a couple seconds of playing with it.  I do not recommend.",Negative
"This one of the worst things that I have ever order from Amazon, I truly want my money back!!!!",Negative
I received literally a printed paper that I could’ve printed myself. Not worth the money.,Negative
Chain was broken and too dainty to repair. This was bought for a gift and was not noted until after given to recipient.,Negative
The one that I had bought from Walmart had a truer sent to the Tom Ford original.,Negative
I also cannot read the dark areas. It disappoints me.,Negative
Much thinner than expected. Hard to put in and close comfortably. Didn’t wear for longer than a day. May work better for ears than nose. Cheap quality,Negative
"The amulet was way smaller than I expected. I probably should have looked deeper into the product description but I thought for the price, it would have to be a reasonable size....I was wrong and it was puny! I started the return process and was told by the company that it was going to cost about $10 to return and after everything was all boxed up , I was charged $27 to return it! I was disgusted and frankly, rather angry. I’ve never been so disappointed by a product that I bought from amazon...especially something that I purchased as a relic of my personal beliefs. If I could give less than one star, I would.",Negative
Ordered thinking it would be on a spool as pictured.  Item description doesn’t say that the spool isn’t included anywhere until you go to “see more” section of the description.  Disappointing and rather expensive not to receive as pictured.,Negative
The hinge broke one week after they arrived.  😡,Negative
Received and it looks tarnished already 😢,Negative
These are not hand made maybe hand spray painted.,Negative
"I like both of the bracelets I recieved, however one of them broke the 2nd time I wore it.",Negative
"It’s not a poster sign, it’s literally a picture printed of someone’s computer.",Negative
"I doubt it is pure silver, because I got skin allergy.",Negative
"Sadly, I did not like the smell at all. It smells rancid.  Before, buying this one ""Happiness""  I bought the ""High Vibes"" which I liked it a lot.  I won't be buying this kind again. :(",Negative
"This was the biggest rip off I’ve ever received off of amazon! The wreath is actually built on a 6 inch frame. It is smaller then my dinner plate. It came with many rotten, smashed eucalyptus sprigs and miss shaped as well. Very upsetting as I was looking so forward to receiving my wreath. 😡",Negative
"Love the idea. But the lettering doesn’t last. I received my case on Jan 4th. And it looks great. Loved it. Got so many compliments. But as of today, Jan. 15th, my name (Lisa gM) is not legible. Not happy. I use my watch edgy day so I’m not holding my phone often. I’m thinking if the lettering would sit on the inside of the case instead of the outside . It may have lasted a bit longer. I’m searching for another personalized case.",Negative
Purchased this as a gift.. it literally broke within one hour of my daughter wearing it!  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Negative
I love the graphic but it has so many tiny cut outs that it’s hard to put on. The clear film is so stuck on the vinyl that when you try to peel it off the whole decal starts coming off. It was frustrating and I ended up removing it and damaging the vinyl. Wasted my money.,Negative
"The service was fine and I received the ring(s) earlier than the estimated date. However, it wasn't as nice as I thought it would be, so I'm very disappointed in the purchase.",Negative
"The necklace doesn’t much with the color of the bracelet,earrings, rings, it’s fragile once you put the earrings on your ear it broken.",Negative
They looked more red than burgundy and you could see my bridesmaids nose and lips.,Negative
"Its printed from computer on photo paper, no border, cant read anything on map I could have printed myself at home on printer",Negative
"I really wanted to love these.  I've had my vaccines, and thought I might stop double masking and wear my fabric mask with one of these filters instead.  Just one problem--I can't breathe!  For some reason, I get very short of breath wearing the mask with this filter.  Tried it while grocery shopping and I couldn't wait to get out of the store and peel off the mask!  Forget wearing it to work for hours and hours!  Guess I'll keep double masking...",Negative
I must have not read this all the way through but I received a picture. I'm so disappointed because now I have to find a frame to put it in and end up patung way more than what I had planned.,Negative
Not happy. Will not be purchasing again,Negative
Front of shirt is great. The image is nice and has an even print. The personalized name on the back is almost see-through screen print - not evenly painted- and doesn’t match the front. It looks cheaply added. Would not purchase again.,Negative
Just pictures. Thought it was ready to hang up when received. Live and learn🤷🏻‍♀️,Negative
"A bit too small, but still cute!",Negative
This piece of jewelry appears as if you got it out of a gum ball machine for a quarter... Do not waist $30.00 on a piece of aluminum.. Truly huge disappointment!!!,Negative
"Im really upset ive bought more then a few bracelets from this seller this one was given to my partner as a gift, he wore it twice and it snapped and the beads went everywhere!",Negative
"Even if fine with ingredients, I couldn't find convenient way to use it.<br />Thrown it to garbage bin after several applications, it should be something wrong with formulation.",Negative
"Overall, super cute. However, I was only able to wear it for about 2 hours before it came off, and lost it. So just be cautious of how loose it is, cuz it will come off.",Negative
Definitely not worth the money not what I expected. Very small not happy.,Negative
"The picture is nice and was delivered on time. But the quality sucks!!!<br />I paid almost $50 for a laminated piece of thin paper. I mean... at least use thick laminate, nope... that's thin too so it easily rips.<br />The grommets are loose and 2 fell off while unrolling the banner which means hanging it from the holes with string rips the corners.  Now I have to tack it to the wall somewhere and it won't be the Center piece.<br />So... I drove from the post office straight to Costco and printed a banner for half the price and better quality than this.<br />Don't buy it!",Negative
"Cute saying, but the product looks like a picture of a picture. Defyingly not worth the money paid for it<br /> Bought it for a present for someone and it as really tacky looking",Negative
Ripped within 3 seconds of putting it on. Waste of money! They looked cute in the package.,Negative
"Disappointed to find it made of paper, poor leather imitation",Negative
I sent the cup back because I thought it had a split in the wood only to receive a new one with an even bigger gap.,Negative
The case looks ok. The lettering is not the best..it look like a preschooler wrote it. The top part of the case did not fit properly and it broke while<br />I was try to place it on. So do not spend your money.,Negative
The material turned to this ugly copper color. So bummed !,Negative
First time receiving a package that came damaged in mail. Zero stars in my book.,Negative
"Dark, and blurry. 8x10 small for that price. Might as well went to walgreens, printed a picture for 4 bucks.",Negative
It’s important to understand what you get for your money.  A padded cloth pocket.  Massively overpriced.,Negative
Bead broke off the post 3 weeks after received.,Negative
"I was not impressed #1 it doesn't fit the wall #2 it looks like a think piece of wall paper in the middle of the wall. If your wall is the same size as this it will be perfect, I ordered the largest one I did not put it up i am going to use it in a different way. When I get that done I'll upload a picture.",Negative
"Ordered in early August for school, didn't get until mid October.  I thought material would be like rubber, flexible. Instead, it was hard thin plastic that would easily  snap in two.",Negative
Not tiny at all. Definitely 20 gauge but the piercing itself is huge on my nose.,Negative
for myself but they were to small,Negative
"I like supporting small businesses however, I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. These stickers were expensive but quality was poor. I can’t even pull off stickers; when I did paper came with it. I was excited because I was starting exercise program. Now, I have to purchase exercise stickers again.",Negative
For the price .. I thought they’d be bigger and more than one. I could’ve glued a charm on a pin by myself and saved the money.,Negative
"This nose ring SUCKS it bent so easily and wouldn't go back into shape, just not worth the buy.",Negative
It's not worthy to have unframed paintings.,Negative
Not exactly what I was hoping fir,Negative
"Extremely cheaply made.  They are nice size and I would even wear these but only if they cost me $8.00 or less, did not even have backs to hold the hoop hook in ear.  They are so flimsily they do not feel like they will hold up.",Negative
"I first tried Mojo products on a trip to Chicago with my sisters in January 2020. (Before things fell apart with pandemic) With my last batch and I literally told everyone I know it was the best eye cream ever. This new one I bought (off Amazon for ease) is not the same as my old one I just used up. The container is smaller, the formula has a more yellow tint, it is “harder” in the container and does not go on as smooth. So disappointed as I feel like I need to find a different eye cream now. I won’t be buying more from Mojo.",Negative
These come with stoppers for the back but they keep falling out from the front because the front hammered part is so narrow. I won’t wear them out because I know I’d lose them.,Negative
"Not only did this come severely damaged, but of course we didn't notice the cracks until we washed it. Water got trapped between the two layers of plastic, and very quickly molded the glass.<br />My daughter was never able to even use this.<br />Complete waste of money.",Negative
"Looks like it has a frame, but doesn't. Picture was folded.",Negative
"I was very disappointed with this eyeglass chain.  While it was very pretty, the pieces that held the chain to the glasses broke apart. This had minimal use. I have many chains for my glasses, so this was not used exclusively.",Negative
One was tiny and the second one was normal size.,Negative
I dont understand why someone would design and sell maps that has  disputed maps. Looks like a conspiracy. They kept kashmir separate name and not part of India.,Negative
It is metal with silver overlay. Not stamped 925 and it not sterling silver! It’s a gimmick!,Negative
It wasn't what I expected was a little disappointed I thought it would have the part to press on but I guess it was part of the image now I am stuck with something I wouldn't use.,Negative
Very beautiful and it looks high quality but came with the stone broken.,Negative
"Tried to use this product on my *new* dreadlocs and there is so much peppermint in it, my scalp turned bright red and began welping up. I dont have any known allergens and all the ingredient on the list ive used before. There is just entirely too much peppermint and now ive wasted my money.",Negative
tarnished and changed color in a few weeks,Negative
Beautiful but the picture is misleading. This item did not come with frame. For the price I could have bought an old dictionary and printed this myself.,Negative
Just not my style.  Can't really see them once they're on.  Returning for something larger.,Negative
"I didn't like the size of the ring as it is too small. I don't have a big nose and the size I chose should have been correct but when I wear it, It does not close all the way and it pinches my skin. Not very happy with this choice and wish I didn't waste my money on one little flimsy item.",Negative
"Wearrow's photo was convinced me I was purchasing a ring with a large opal (lab). This ring is tiny. The ring is called stackable, but I would appreciate a photo of a model wearing it. Very misleading advertising. I'll post photos from my iPhone.",Negative
These are just a silver wire that is slightly flattened on one end.  Very soft and fragile.  Wife did not care for them at all.  The photos are a bit misleading as I had to look through a magnifying glass to see the ends were flattened.  Disappointing.,Negative

"I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with. Please be careful and be aware of this when ordering your pendant.<br />I would order this again in a heartbeat if the cross coin was a bit larger and much heavier.",Negative
I ordered this item expecting the personalization plus the design showed in the above picture. It didn’t the ID is plain and only includes the personalization I specifically added. Glad it was reasonably priced because it is cheaply made.,Negative
I did not think the product meet my expectations: they do not seem to be authentic pearls.,Negative

"this product looks nothing like its description company very misleading, do not buy this product it is trash",Negative
"What you are not seeing in the picture is there’s a bigger ball on the end that you have to push through your ear that goes through the hoop. Also, the hoops arrived misshappened and seem of low quality. Wouldn’t purchase again",Negative
I am soooooo mad!!! There is no longitude or latitude. I added it to my order and a message but the message is the only thing that got added. Took me a while to find the long-latt of the location we met.,Negative
"didn't receive the item, although it was beautiful, it was over 2 days in late delivery and Amazon gave me the go around, so i cancelled the order.",Negative
"The item is only a piece of paper. It does not come with a picture frame depicted in the pictures, and is no where near worth the money for a piece of paper.",Negative

Felt cheap and broke in 3 weeks.,Negative
"I am quite disappointed with this product.  As soon as I opened the package it was already cracked, as if it were old. When I tried taking a cube out, the package cracked again. The directions instruct to keep in air tight packaging.... that’s pretty much impossible with the package it was sent in. I got very little essential oil /menthol smell. Seems like the product and container are old. I do not recommend.",Negative
Tiny.,Negative
"It fits the light panel spot fine, but it has very poor quality printing for the design. A small scratch will take the printing right off, and the printing is grainy.",Negative
They were way smaller than I was expecting 😅 to me they are more like small children earrings. I guess I didn’t read the size.,Negative
Very cheap looking. I returned.,Negative
I bought this product with no inscription just the blank bar to use layered with other necklaces. Within a week the bar has lost it's &#34;shine&#34; and looks dull next to other silver items. Not satisfied for the price spent.,Negative
"Pictures are incredibly deceptive about size. Absolutely not worth the price. The slime is nothing special, neither is the plushy. Save your money. My daughter learned the hard way. 😒",Negative
"I wish I could say I was happy, but was given the wrong order! The wording that I purchased is NOT that wording that came, which is very disappointing because I didn't have time to wait for a correction, so I just had to return it all together.",Negative

La verdad. No me gustó!,Negative
"I received this product, I was so disappointed in this flimsy product and the top portion would not close, since this was personalized, I knew I could not return the item, so I just threw the Airpod case in the garbage along with my hard earn money.",Negative
The necklace is cute but I don't recommend because it pulls hair terribly. It's the type of chain the wraps up in your hair and janks it out. If there was a different chain this would be 5 stars.,Negative
"very disappointed,dull,different grinding angles on edge,antler doesn't fit<br />the tang,cheap sheath won't snap. it's going back,not worth 1/2 the price.",Negative

Pensé que eran letras grandes,Negative
I bought this for my best friend. This is the photo she sent me. What is wrong with the humming bird.. Is there a worm in the flower? I thought that it would have a greenish antique look. Not at all. She's happy with it.. But I am disappointed that the photo on Amazon is not what it looks like in person. Too bad.,Negative
"I got this as a gift and the return window closed right before I was giving it to the recipient.  The minute he opened it and began putting it on the color in the words started coming off.  We tried to get it all off, but it wouldn't come off.  It looks awful and appears to truly be cheap workmanship.  Would NOT recommend.  I will come back and add a photo in another review or to this one if possible.",Negative
"VERY cute, HOWEVER, and this is just my opinion, I think it's a bit overpriced @$12.00... it's a tiny trincket.. I've placed two of my rings in front of it so you can see in the pics just how small.",Negative

Disappointed😔 the s is so close to the I and couldnt distinguished it. And the first e is so close that it looks so blur.,Negative

This was a MESS!!! It came wrinkled and UGLY. OMGOODNESS. The RED in that flag is ORANGE. I will be too damn embarrassed to take that to my son’s graduation from Boot Camp. They’re going to be wondering what flag that is because it’s ORANGE. Don’t waste your money. See if WAL-GREENS have something like it.,Negative

"There's a similar appearing item on etsy that is much more substantial for only $5 more, a very high quality and structured bag. This bag is a very thin and flimsy very basic canvas tote with a zipper top and the pocket organizer is tiny compared to the bag so its more like another random item tossed in than anything helpful. The embroidery is nice though, unfortunately however that makes it unreturnable.",Negative

I won’t be able to do business with this company and I feel like it would’ve been nice had the order process went more smoother,Negative
So cute but plot this out on the wall before you buy.  My mistake but can't return.  Looks like a post-it note where I wanted it.,Negative

I am not sure if I put them in wrong and closed them wrong when they were in my ears but the little opening always got stuck inside my ear. I was very hopeful but they did not work out for me. I would say that if you have sensitive ears, do not buy these.",Negative

Liked the feel but WAY overpriced for 1 handkerchief.,Negative

This seemed to be low quality especially the chain.,Negative
It's what I thought it worked,Negative
"This item looked like it had already been used and was very junky looking. The gold was missing in several areas and black was showing through. The package, which I did not bother opening, was chewed up and had holes in it. I ordered it for a party and even though it said overnight delivery, it wasn’t shipped until a couple days later. It did not arrive in time so I had to order something else. Sort of glad it happened that way though because the bracelets I ended up using were much nicer than this one.",Negative

Brass eyelet started tearing through on first use. Seams came apart and all the sand came out after a week of light use. Would not recommend.,Negative
These are much smaller than anticipated and extremely light weight.  Way overpriced for the size.,Negative
I like the size but after wearing it for a few weeks it started to hurt my nose. I took it out and the &#34;sterling silver&#34; had turned blue/green. I am going to be buying a different one now.,Negative
"When I received the sign it’s chipped from the sides and the picture is deceiving. The picture shows the piece to have color, but mine came chipped and colorless. It was not painted. When I went to get a refund they are charging me 40 bucks to get it shipped for my refund which was also around 40 bucks.",Negative
"In the title of this item it should include the word “MINI” as we opened the package and it’s not at all what we expected. When it said “plaque” we expected it to be 7 or 8 inches big, not the 3 inches it turned out to be.",Negative
Returning … looked way bigger online .. very small and overpriced… it was a gift but was embarrassed to give it after I seen how small it was,Negative
The chain is not very strong & the camper is not very thick. It’s ok for the price.,Negative
Writing color doesn’t really match the picture.,Negative
"the bradding around the balls is uneven. Also, the slip knot does not hold firmly, and the bracelet falls off.",Negative
Silver heart was tarnished!,Negative
These earrings are extremely heavy.  They are painful to wear.,Negative
"My husband gave this to me in memory of my Mom. It looked & sounded like it was silver in the description & picture, but it’s mostly black & cheap looking. Poor quality. Will return it!",Negative
"Loved this when we got it & even ordered one for a CO friend, but the silver line has quickly faded into a pink shade and the rest brown. It didnt fade until after I got her hers, super disappointed",Negative
The wall hook on the back is severely off center and crooked.  I cannot hang it on the wall at all.  Since it is extremely small I can use it in another way and will keep it for only that reason.,Negative
Doesn't explain it's for the skin under the beard not for conditioning the beard hair.,Negative
"the packing was good. the ring looks good on but from the first time i wore it, it gave me an allergic reaction. and the allergy spread into the next finger. the rash stayed for 3 weeks.",Negative
It's too small to even fit a nose. Good for kids. Not for adults.,Negative
crappy product and not worth the price.,Negative
You can literally print this on your own computer printer and have the same exact results except it would probably not be dented like mine was. Definitely NOT worth $15,Negative
"I followed the directions all the way however the decal isn't sticking at all I had to put tape on the back of it. The unicorn especially was in need of tape to make it stay. I would have returned and still may, but my daughter loves it nonetheless. I wouldn't buy this product ever again especially since I spent the highest amount because I needed for it to be really big over her bed. I am totally dissatisfied with this product. I received a different name decal from another company and it was great no problems at all.",Negative
"This print was received as a wedding gift and while the thought was nice, the quality of the print could be better. The print is really dark and has no contrast and for $30 and personalized, I would expect better quality.<br /><br />Be sure you don't misspell either...one simple transpose of a letter and the company will not work with you. No return calls made, they expect you to purchase a new one and may offer 25% refund if you fight.<br /><br />Another disappointing factor is this print isn't available on their website, on here on Amazon. We aren't going to ask the person who gifted to buy a new one, nor do we feel the need to give them more money.<br /><br />If the print quality was better as well as CS, we would would have.",Negative
"I didn’t like it, it’s difficult to put on",Negative
Arrived early put in my melter no smell was excited for this smell like bathd body but no smell hard for me to shop as i am disabled  disappointed,Negative
"I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.",Negative
"It might just be me, but I really didn’t enjoy this. It feels very cheap and doesn’t do much to help with my picking issues. It doesn’t pick easily at all and the materials are just not really great. I really wanted to like this. It’s a great idea, but the quality could be better.",Negative
Horrible. Cheap looking. Definitely not what is pictured. Don’t waste your money.,Negative
"I’m honestly at lost for words.. it came in the mail yesterday (3/26/22), I washed it ASAP because I was wanting to wear it TODAY (3/27/22).. get it out of the dryer and the words are already coming off??? I just got this shirt not even 24 hours ago… I’m not going through the hassle of arguing over returning the shirt and getting another one made so I’ll just be getting the shirt made somewhere else. So frustrated considering I paid a total of $26.26. AND it arrived late.<br /><br />On the bright side, they put it in a cute watermelon package 😂",Negative
Very attractive but no stretch to it so it is very tight on a man.,Negative
"When it said small, I should have really searched for dimensions. It fits between two fingers on small hands. For $10 I expected something a bit bigger. Can't imagine this not getting lost.",Negative
This doesn’t glow at all.,Negative
"this is just a pattern?? what a rip off. when i bought this a couple of weeks ago, it did not have the big letters, NO MATERIALS INCLUDED...<br /><br />Why would I buy a pdf of something that I don't have???",Negative
"There's a similar appearing item on etsy that is much more substantial for only $5 more, a very high quality and structured bag. This bag is a very thin and flimsy very basic canvas tote with a zipper top and the pocket organizer is tiny compared to the bag so its more like another random item tossed in than anything helpful. The embroidery is nice though, unfortunately however that makes it unreturnable.",Negative
"Soooo...I agree with the last reviewer about the font not being correct and the caduceus overlaps with the writing. Plus, my name is Melissa, not Meligga.",Negative
No lleno mis expectativas,Negative
Do NOT purchase! The map is completely pixely and blurry. YOU CANNOT READ ANY OF THE TEXT ON IT.<br />It’s literally worth less than the box it came in!,Negative
"This is advertised as engraved, but it was printed white, not engraved. Super disappointed and will be returning.",Negative
Unable to gift and I bought 3 different styles. Returned all because they felt cheap even for the price and like they wouldn’t last a week.,Negative
Could have made it myself.  Its just two peices of wood.,Negative
This thing was tipped over and broke immediately. I have other glasses just like it. I've knocked them over and they survived.,Negative
It’s a beautiful earring but very thin. I was able to wear them twice and afterwards it broke at the back. I contacted the seller to reorder or rectify this order without success. Never heard back from them. If they were made a little thicker and stronger they would have been perfect. Again only got to wear them twice. I don’t sleep in my earrings either.,Negative
The last piece fell off the same day. Cheaply put together.,Negative
broken we really needed it as soon as possible.,Negative
"Horrible horrible! Looked beautiful and then about two and a half weeks in it has tarnished so horribly. It looks so bad! Complete waste of money! This was a gift for my 14 year old sister who just lost her dad, I'm so dissapointed",Negative
"This piece of glass looks like a chunk off the bottom of a colored glass bottle.  It doesn’t look like sea glass at all.  It’s clunky and not pretty.  I have to give it one star because I don’t have a choice not to give it any.<br /><br />Also, if you try to return it, they will make you pay postage.  What a waste of money!!!",Negative
Has an odd smell reminiscent of burnt snuff (old fashioned ground powdered tobacco) 🫤,Negative
Very small,Negative
Love the look of this ring. It LOOKS like it has some weight to it. It doesn’t. Very lightweight which is okay. Main problem was the aquamarine stone. Apparently was glued into place and not with anything strong? I guess what would’ve helped is if they had extended the casing up and over the edges of the stone to secure it in place. Was so sad when it fell off a few hours after I started wearing it and o couldn’t find the stone. If I’d found it I would’ve used something to reattach since I love the look of this ring so much. Unfortunately couldn’t  find the stone and can’t afford to blow off $126 so I had to return. 🥲,Negative
[[VIDEOID:d872d30cea1f7524e2fa931828c218d3]] I was totally mislead 😕 The bracelet is not for adults. MAYBE for a newborn at best.,Negative
"I bought my Silver Metal Band in June 30, 2017. I was so excited when I reveived it. I got so much complements on it, it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. After wearing it for just a few months the charm discolored, that was a big disappointment. I changed the band. When I went back to use the Silver Metal Band the latch didn't snap back on. Its no good. I couldn't believe it. I probably use it for about 5 months, once I removed it that was it. I haven't been able to use it :/",Negative
It looks nice but less than a month having it the blue started coming off and sticking to my skin.  I didn’t use it in the shower or with perfumes.  The company gave me my money back but didn’t replace it since they didn’t know why it fell apart.,Negative
Lacks lusture,Negative
This deodorant did nothing to prevent smelling bad. I’ve only had it for a week so I don’t know about the lightening aspect but I put it on morning and night and it does not combat body odor at all!,Negative
Definitely a mistake buying this for this amount. Can print it yourself and it would cost you 2 bucks.,Negative
Print quality is OK at best. It came damaged. Was going to be a gift.,Negative
Only received 30. My order was shorted.  Not worth money I paid.,Negative
Cheaply made … the carbiner broke within a couple of days & the the top of case won’t stay in place. Would not recommend,Negative
"Even in the photo, this has a misspelling. Why would anyone purchase this?",Negative
Cute but turns my finger green.,Negative
The pin had fallen off. One of the prongs had broken.,Negative
Terrible. 7 washes and image has peeled off.,Negative
Too difficult to assemble!  I gave up,Negative
Cute but does not function well as an actual needle minder. The decor on the top is too thick so there is magnet force to have the needle stay<br />Very disappointing,Negative
It is small and cheap. Would not buy it again.,Negative
I am sorry but the scents were way toooo strong for me,Negative
"this necklace always gets tangled the other way around even if I fixed it. I would love to return but there's no return option, my mistake for not checking. I've learned my lesson and now I won't purchase anything from Amazon if I can't return it. I'm not even wearing it anymore. It's not even worth the price!!",Negative
It did not fit my phone even though it was one they said would fit.,Negative
"Idea is right on, but the dice do not land flat in the grass where you can distinctly determine the dice.",Negative
When i saw this it does not tell you that you get get just 1. It is pretty but it looks nicer in the picture. I was really excited to get these and i have it now and very disappointed 😕,Negative
"Really cute, however it had a very odd shape, came with jagged edges, not easy to get in, once in the jagged edges cut the inner skin of my nose very sore.",Negative
"They appeared more attractive time in photo.  The earring part that goes into earlobe looks like something that is rusted and  was in pieces.  The backs were just painted orange.  For what I payed for these earrings, they were not worth it.",Negative
Very cheap looking,Negative
Crap….their return policy sucks! Don’t waste your money!,Negative
"I applied this to a clean, dry, inside wall and it rolled off by the next morning and couldn’t even fix it since it was stuck to itself. It did not adhere appropriately even after applying it directly.",Negative
Too pricey for a plastic unit,Negative
The product doesn't seem to clip onto my duct and wish it was about 4 inches longer to blow from under the seat,Negative
The writing is nice seeing my kids names but I was disappointed that they didn't get the birth stones right,Negative
Said it was a woman’s necklace but the chain was so short.,Negative
It broke the first time I wore it,Negative
"I haven’t had a month and chain is turning! Do not expect chain to be good quality, hoping charm holds up",Negative
This product is literally just oil on your lips. Does not work at alll i applied exactly as mentioned and noo type of progress,Negative
tacky,Negative
It was alright. I kept it. But not as nice looking as I thought,Negative
Very disappointed. There was a blue pen mark on mine that I couldn’t bleach out.,Negative
Made of some type of wood??? Feels cheap.,Negative
This is terrible because the stain comes off when moist. To scared to let my baby use it. Do not buy.  Wiped it gently with a moist cloth after removed from packing.,Negative
Just did not look like items shown. Wife hated it.,Negative
"I need something like this for my masterbath between the mirrors. When i decide on something I will not buy it from this vendor. The vendor's remarks are insulting to ikea (awesome option for so.many.needed.things) and the public in general. The vendor's pricing is insulting for this product. After this,  If i don't decide to buy something from Ikea i will walk ouside and get scrap wood and make this for ... well, nothing. The pricing on this product is just silly.",Negative
Poor smell,Negative
"This is a piece of manufactured junk and not a genuine stone. It literally left a blue imprint on my neck. The cord is better quality than the stone. If you care about the properties of the gemstone, don’t buy this.",Negative
"The printing looks beautiful and the ship speed was great, unfortunately the way they attach the lettering is less than ideal. I washed the boxers once before I wore them for my wife and the letters already started to peel off. I'd keep that in mind if you're planning on something that lasts for a while; these definitely seem like a one-off surprise",Negative
Looked larger in pic,Negative
Look different than description and cheap material,Negative
Bought this for my 16-year-old granddaughter. She has anxiety and thought it would really help her. When she received it she couldn't even put it around her neck. She said it felt all plasticy. She and I was very disappointed after seeing the reviews.,Negative
I lthought I would love everything about this. When it came in it is super small and looks very fragile and cheap. It is not as big as they say. Now I have to find another Christmas ornament in a week to give,Negative
Nose ring look horrible,Negative
"The name is tiny, and not as pictured. Name is also not in all caps. If you order make sure to type all caps in the customization box. Also make the number of spaces you want between letters to make it bigger. Otherwise you’ll get a tiny name in lower case on a huge strap.",Negative
"Cute moon, but flimsy and cheap looking/feeling. Also ****FAKE MOLDAVITE**** this is green glass, it is a scam. This moldavite is NOT REAL and DID NOT come with any certificate of authenticity",Negative
Very disappointing. Poor craftsmanship. Looked nothing like photo— eyes were flat discs instead of spherical. Also none of the eyes were attached to the hat. 2 of the 3 black pupils were not attached either. Hat was smushed because it was sent in a cheap plastic bag inside a plastic mailer. No protective padding.,Negative
Do not buy! Broke in the first 6 hours I had it on!,Negative
"I was going to buy this, but the description of the product is &#34;boy's room decor.&#34; Well, too bad I'm a woman. I guess girls/women aren't allowed to have video game art, still, in this day and age. What's with the gendered advertising? Get with the times.",Negative
"Robe itself is nice. The writing on the back is VERY hard to read. It is NOT as legible as the sellers photos show (I will post my photo soon) I opted for an exact writing and coloring of robe and letters as seller has posted in her images. I had it made as a gift for my sister in law. I contacted the seller about this. I spent close to $45 including shipping (mind you seller and I are in the same state) and seller wrote back she would refund me IF I purchased another robe and she would try and place the writing in a more blank spot, due to the cut of the floral fabric. In less than 24hrs she closed the Amazon case before I was able to situate this issue. It should be stated that writing and floral cut is not guaranteed to be the same. It makes a big difference when the wording is directly through the flowers and in the same color as the flowers...",Negative
Not what I was expecting for $20.00 not worth it I should just return it should be half star,Negative
Missing was leather necklace and drawstring jewelry bag.<br />Pendant is nice but useless without necklace.  Disappointing,Negative
"Ordered in gold. It arrived in gold, but has since rubbed off and turned silver. I do not wear it to shower, sleep, or workout",Negative
I’ve purchased these from other vendors many times before and have never had a hard time with application.... this one though was very very difficult to apply. It was not sticky enough to stay on and I had to apply them one at a time. I just hope it stays on now.,Negative
"Cheap sign. Arrived damaged, not the box .. the actual piece .. they didn't align where the wooden edges meet, no thought or quality put into it. Trying to return and having the hardest time. They know they sent me junk and Amazon hasn't been helpful either. I will NEVER buy third party seller again because of this experience with this seller.",Negative
I reached out when ours arrived crooked.  They had me take a picture and said they were sure they had made it correctly so there could not be anything wrong with it and I should try to fix it myself. So I tried. Unsuccessfully. Reached back out twice. Never heard back. Avoid!,Negative
"Guys, this is not useful. This perpetuates the idea that how you’re feeling about your child’s behavior is more important than how your child is actually feeling or behaving. Also, punishments like timeouts for “bad behavior” are ineffective and alter your child’s attachment security.<br /><br />Speaking from a place of parenting with a degree in psychology with a concentration in behaviorism.",Negative
Turned yellowish and top kept coming off.,Negative
I returned item. Just not what I expected,Negative
Not as easy to put in at keep its shape as the video suggests.,Negative
Won’t purchase from this seller again,Negative
"I was excited to get these for our funny theme guest bathroom and for the price I’m disappointed. It was printed on fujifilm photo paper. Not even a nice matte paper or cardstock. The imagine is just ok.. it almost look like it got distorted from the imagine being blown up too large. It’s not pixelated, just… fuzzy? I don’t know it’s just ok. It’s for a guest half bath for laugh value so I’m keeping it but I won’t order more prints from here.",Negative
"I will say it is a cute idea, but the wood they used was horrible, it was all burnt color and not very attractive, I had to paint it before I use it just to make it more attractive. not what I thought, it could have been painted before it was shipped.  even white would have been fine, but not bare wood.",Negative
This paper posters and they are terrible. WY too expensive for this type of product I would never buy again!,Negative
Very pretty product but the front part with my name fell off the 3rd day of wearing this,Negative
I ordered the pink earrings they are pale pink not the rich pink color in the picture.,Negative
"I have allergies, have real silver",Negative
The picture says it all. There was no place for me to give them directions that I did not want their tool icons or images on my sign. So I took a chance thinking that somebody would have the forethought not to put the tools on a no diving sign. I would return the damn thing but I needed it for insurance purposes. Somebody needs to pull their head out of their bottom and think about their customers needs! Who in the hell would want wrenches and screwdrivers on a simple sign that says no diving shallow.,Negative
"If you are bigger than a size 2 you wont be able to wear these fanny packs around your waist like they're intended for. Horrible product. Wouldnt recommend these to anyone. And not to mention the seller, CampusConnection is giving me a hard time when trying to request a refund. Horrible customer service on their end",Negative
"On the bottom stud you see the prong is not covering a big part of the stone, yes it is also loose.  I can and have been approved for return but I have to pay shipping for a unusable product, not cool.",Negative
Was not worth $25. They look like doughnuts.  I thought it was bling ...,Negative
I asked to exchange this ring. The policy states I could not because it was hand made. I then asked Amazon to contact the Vendor if I could exchange the ring for a larger size because the ring did not fit me. Amazon denied the exchange or return. I then asked if she would consider exchanging the ring and I would buy two other rings. I have no use for the ring because it does not fit. Would the Vendor please contact me to personally talk to me about this problem? I would like to solve this problem. I only want an exchange not a refund.,Negative
way too large decided to return,Negative
Very disappointed 12 dollars for a cheap made dish towel. RIP off!!,Negative
Not what I expected at all and doesn't come framed,Negative

Nothing still in package to small,Negative
"Tooled great, looks great, but unless you have a shock of hair for this, you will have to use a ponytail band of some sort. One comes with it but it quickly stretched out. Made of a sort of Rayon material.",Negative
Thought it was bigger and better quality but its just a print on parchment paper basically,Negative
"Very pretty but it broke after one use, the little metal circle attachment croke off and there is not a way to fix it. I would like a return but can not get a link to send it back as of yet.",Negative
Tried contacting seller for an exchange. Maybe a month after I got the shirt the lower seam came out. No response wait at least 2 weeks for a reaponse n nothing. So just leaving a review for oghers that are about to pay $30 for a short that doeant last a month.,Negative
"Look at the new reviews. Surprised this guy is still doing this. Very small, absolutely not worth $10. You could do the same thing yourself for $2 at Walmart. Very illegal.",Negative
I own a 70 Charger 500 and would be all over this but the print is not correct. The car in print has &#34;R/T&#34; door scoopes. The Charger 500 does not have these.,Negative
Not satisfied at all.,Negative
"Extremely fast shipping. However, the plastic used is very thin and has started to tear.",Negative
Would not buy again.,Negative
One of the names is printed wrong spelling and in my customization I printed it exactly how it was supposed to be spelled on my necklace and they still spelt it wrong. Nephew name is spelt CONNER. Exactly what I wrote in my customization and they put an o instead of the e,Negative

"...or regret spending over $100 on a floating 8 inch wide shelf.  PLEASE READ IF YOUR ARE ORDERING OVER 6 INCHES WIDE!  It is NOT one piece of wood!!!  It is two they have stuck together which couldn't: 1. Look more tacky if it tried 2. Be more impractical as they are not even solidly attached to each other to make one cohesive piece (They have made '8 inch' out of a 6 inch and 2 inch which are somehow not solidly attached but physically come apart).  The stain is orangey and I don't think the wood is reclaimed or industrial in feel, though it is real.  I hate the edge.  I hate it all.  I was denied a refund and have had this sitting on various floors throughout the house for 5 months since I purchased it.  I have lost the mounting hardware...  I am finally going to claim defeat and hang in on a back wall behind the door of my son's room with brackets.  Might change it to 2 stars at that point if I'm lucky.  Buyer beware and buyer be sure!",Negative
I received one bar of soap when the picture depicted 3. It should have been clearer if there is only one bar for the price point. The soap itself looked strange. I've bought handmade soap before and I guess I was expecting something similar. I sent it back because I wouldn't pay $6 for one bar of soap (especially when I was expecting 3).,Negative
I didn’t purchase anything like this,Negative
THIS IS NOT STERLING SILVER!! It’s plastic!! I was extremely disappointed being that I paid $20 for it!,Negative

So I got the cup and it was great at first. It does change color like it says. BUT then I started using it and had to wash the cup. The lettering on the cup lasted through 2 washes and came off. You can still see the outline of the letters on the cup but all the glitter and sparkles are gone. I would not recommend buying this unless you plan on not washing it....which is gross!,Negative
"They don't last. The rubber inside that the post sticks into always streches out and the posts don't stay in. Also, the tips break off.<br /><br />They are my favorite style of faux gages, though. Just wish they were better made.",Negative
This item is literally a cheap plain face plate with decorative tape on it. I’m so annoyed. Natural oils on fingers or hands that turn off and on the light will eventually cause this is discolor and fade. Complete let down,Negative
Looks great at first...took less than a week for charms to tarnish.  Waste of money. Loved it at first just needs to be better quality.,Negative
"I have to say, these cufflinks are large and look great. In fact they are the largest cufflinks i own.  These are attention grabbers.<br /><br />I wore them and got compliments throughout the morning. I went to lunch and felt my French cuffs.  Why? Well the lion head was gone.  It broke in less than one workday.  (Photo shows what's left of cufflink)<br /><br />Very flimsy and cheap.  SAD!",Negative

I ordered 2 of these necklaces. The one I received was very pretty but the chain broke within 3 or 4 days. I ordered another one for my granddaughter the first part of December and as of December 23 I still have not received. The company will replace the broken one but it’s not at my home it’s at my other granddaughters . It’s very pretty but cheaply made. IMO.,Negative
waiting A long time for this and when it came was in bad shape Just looked old and beat up.,Negative
"I purchased these dandelion prints for baby’s playroom. Like most other reviewers, I agree that the right-sided picture (without the stems) appears fuzzy and digitized. The worst part is that both of these arrived with a crease, and since the paper has a sheen to it this is very noticeable in the frame. This seller should really package the item better to prevent creasing from happening. (I would return these prints, however I waited to put the prints in frames because the baby is still a few weeks away, and now the return window has closed.)",Negative

"Please help, big crack thru the “9”, that travels across top of sign.  In back in knot is another crack I fear will connect to top crack and become bigger issue.  Wedding is in 3.5 weeks,  I like the product but cannot give it like this. Please advise...",Negative

The chain broke after one night of wearing it.,Negative
I thought this picture would come in a photo frame. Not just paper frame. It is my fault I didn’t really read the description. If I knew this I wouldn’t of spend 25 dollars on it.  The picture is what I wanted but I think a frame should of been included.,Negative
I am highly disappointed with this product. It is definitely not worth the $20 I paid. It's not even worth $10,Negative

Please know that this is not a three dimensional manatee. The back of it is pen/hollow.  It doesn’t look realistic if you’re a manatee lover like me. Disappointed:(<br /><br />Update on 2/21/23:  The crystal came off now :(,Negative
Terrible! The Recall Newsom sticker is literally TAPED on to a magnet. Magnet is not strong due to tape. Save your money and make your own. You can literally buy magnets that you don't have to apply tape too. There are magnets that allow for items to stick to them without tape. I'm highly disappointed in this.,Negative
"So mail delivery let's not get into but received box in the open position didn't think much of it, but after inspecting it, understand why sent that way, was made bad, unaligned and obviously as seen in first pic was damaged from before it was sent so can't close, had it been able to close I'd be ok with it, paint a little meh, just paid too much for it not to work properly",Negative
"I should have read the comments, this thing doesn't quite look like the picture and is way too chunky to wear. The gems are on long metal posts that stick way out. I got this to match a rose gold necklace I purchased at the same time, but its too chunky and fake looking to wear.",Negative
Metal is very soft and discolored very quickly. Not worth 89 dollars.,Negative
They were both so tarnished they were almost black,Negative
The magnets are very weak,Negative
"I was excited for this new shirt. The day it arrived I washed it on a regular color cycle made sure to set my washer on cold water and the shirt came out like this! After a single wash the ink on the letters is faded now, it has weird stains and it stained other clothes that threw in with the shirt. Just disappointed with the quality.",Negative
"The bag itself seems of decent quality, but the buckles and zippers are tarnished so bad that they look like they have been stored under water.  I had to scrape white calcium like stuff from the metal.  Some cannot be removed.  &#34;Rustic&#34; is NOT the word I would use.",Negative
They need to improve the product so the smell last longer,Negative
The gem was cute but the silver was completely oxidized and I dunno if it's old or new also no where it was marked as a 925 sterling silver.<br />I think I will return it.,Negative
"This product was smaller than expected. Due to the size of the knobs on the letters, it is not suitable for a child aged 1 to 3 years as advertised.",Negative
The necklace is designed poorly so that the gem hangs down 90% of the time you wear it. It does not lay flat on the chest with sparkly stone facing forward.,Negative
Was expecting slightly bigger stones...somewhat dissapointed!,Negative
very cheaply made,Negative
I hate these! Looks like a 1 year old did arts and crafts. The little prince is nothing but paper glued to a clothes hanger!,Negative

"This product is NOT worth what I paid for it.  DO NOT purchase a name board from this company.  The board that the letters fit in is VERY thin and will break VERY easily it's so thin.  The message that I paid extra for on the back of the board is also VERY poor quality.  Some of the letters are very visible and will fade.  I would not have chosen ANY STARS, but I had to choose at least one.  VERY DISSATISFIED!",Negative
The butterfly part is pretty but the sticks to attach it looks like or is a painted pencil. Would not have bought it if  I realized that. With shipping costs does not pay to return it.,Negative
Wanted some wording for a birthday. The letters did not stick to the backdrop and was very fragile. Tore at the slightest tug. When asking about another set or some alternative option…was told it was my fault and nothing could be done. Will take my business elsewhere,Negative
"Stickers and pictures on magnets are blurry and poor quality. As these are meant to be a gag gift, it’s fine enough but would not purchase again or recommend.",Negative
Not shani,Negative
"I ordered 2 of these to decorate a cup for my mother and myself. I followed the directions to the letter, but part of the decal would stick and the other would try to pull off. I went back and repeated the step to help get it to attach to the cup and was finally able to get 1 of them to work. The second one went on but when I went to pick it up, the decal came right off.",Negative
"This bracelet is supposed to be for a 10 year old girl. However, the circumference of it is almost 8 inches, which is way too big for a child. Very disappointed.",Negative
"The sticker while very detailed, has a large area that is not the actual sticker and it is very hard to line up on the window correctly.  It is SUPER sticky and if you don't get it placed correctly there is no way to reposition it without damaging the sticker.",Negative
These “photo prints” came torn and in an envelope that was so dirty and worn. Like it had been sitting on a shelf for years. I really want these and hope the seller made a mistake and will replace them. So sad as I love them.,Negative
To big around.,Negative
"Got the wrong color, but ok so far",Negative
I was disappointed how small it was.,Negative
"I was really looking forward to the purple shown in the advertisement,  but you can see by my picture they are not the same. I do however like what I got and will be keeping it. The thermal changes well.",Negative
"Good for one day,then turns to a ""different"" substance. We are not happy.",Negative
It’s just okay…a little “cheesy” looking in person and certainly not worth $99.,Negative
Horrible. Waste of money<br />I paid extra for the silver color and it's just small and it doesnt look good at all.<br />Disappointed.,Negative
"Lettering falling off, just gave it to wife for mother's day and she's wearing it out. Looks down and letters are peeling off. This is iron on and not printed.",Negative
The ring was too large.  I tried to contact the seller to send it back but received no response after several tries,Negative
"Although the looks of this clock fit our decor theme well, the functionality is lacking in that the hands on this clock are not attached very well at all.  The minute hand fell off almost instantly!  We have jerry-rigged it to keep it going, but are strongly disappointed by it.",Negative
"In the picture it looks like gold (like in the movie Neverending Story). However it's only wood. Then I went to return it, they charged for the UPS shipping which was almost the same price as the product. Definitely wouldn't order from them again.",Negative
"i bought two sburb logo stickers to put on my car and my water bottle and was really excited to get them, but one of the stickers that arrived wasn’t even remotely the right thing. it was an inspirational quote instead. i was very disappointed.",Negative
I bought this originally for my mother after she was diagnosed and the first one broke within a couple weeks. They sent out a replacement easily enough but that one lasted less than a month before it too broke in the same way.,Negative
The setting was beautiful but I prefer the lavender Tanzanite. Sent this back on March 24th and I’m still waiting for my refund.I reached out twice to the seller and have not heard back.,Negative
"Very cute but not worth the money, if you have a printer you can print this out yourself. It did come well packaged and arrived neat and crisp but I was shocked it did not come framed and it was a single sheet of photo paper. Not worth the money when you can print it yourself.",Negative
"Attention seller! Customers should be able to preview what the custom pendant will look like before they purchase. Also, why can't sides 2-4 be written horizontally? Only side one can be? Thats silly",Negative
Was almost 2 weeks later than shipping date. Received refund. When it did show was junk. Would not give as a gift. Would like to return or just throw away or let grandkids have in their toy pile,Negative
"I love this little choker but the second time I wore it, the tie that pulls it apart and tightens it, got stuck and now it won’t budge.",Negative

The print is not very clear,Negative
Looks & feels like tin,Negative
"For $60 I expected a little more durability. The 1 bys that were used were not all predrilled like instructions stated. Also sent with sheet rock screws not wood screws, also had plastic drywall anchors but no mounting screws only Sheetrock screws. Screws only allow for approximately 1/2 inch of screw into all portions of the wood including only 1/2in into the wall being mounted on. Do not recommend. Idea is awesome but not for $60.",Negative
"No directions for metal only glass, but sold for mailbox",Negative
It is pretty and the photos are true to the way that it appears but it is not sturdy at all for it to fall apart from the chord.,Negative
Cheap and very small.  Not worth $10.00 much less what I had to pay for it.. Don’t waste your money on this.,Negative
Definitely wasn't expecting the size 🤏,Negative
A.A.Milne is turning over in his grave.,Negative
"Just received the banner and sign. Both look like something that could be purchased at Walmart for $20 less than I paid. Perhaps my expectations were high, but the pictures have much more of a handmade appearance, while the actual products do not. Pretty disappointed and would not purchase from this seller again.",Negative
"This pin is made from wood, and the paint, especially the black, bleeds into the other colors. There is no sealant or shellac on the pin. This pin chipped within a week of having it. I filled the chip in with red sharpie and it seemed to look somewhat ok, but then it complexity broke off the actual pin and was lost. I wanted to love this and support the artist, but it was so disappointing right from the get go. I wouldn’t even bother purchasing",Negative
The slime was not very good. It ripped apart and was not what I thought it would be.,Negative
Too small. Waste of money. It was cheaply made and so sharp it cut me putting it in.,Negative
These are quite small. Only decorative. Not usual or useful wooden spoons.,Negative
The stones are beautiful and colorful but I was very disappointed in the cheap string. I would not give this as a gift until I replaced the string. It’s lightweight and value for the money is ok,Negative
Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. It broke on Jan 5.,Negative
"so disappointed. For real these aren't even children size, these are BABY SIZE. Not worth it",Negative
Did not smell like cotton candy.,Negative
This thing is cheap! If you do not have a real ear piercing then you are go to go and fake it. But it you have a real piercing this thing is junk. I thre it away 30 seconds after receiving it.,Negative
My daughter loved this necklace when she got it for Christmas.  But within a week the pendant came off the chain and was lost.,Negative
"Seventy eight bucks for 2 tiny, cheap pieces of wood with flimsy twine and eye hooks. Absolutely will not last outdoors, which was for our intended purpose. Very, very disappointed in the quality and durability of these ""signs"".",Negative
Couldn’t tell it was flat in photo. The middle area is bumped up where the seed is. Thought it was oval  and encased.,Negative
VERY DISAPPOINTED. I bought a 1981 ring and the number 9 looks like a 0 (zero) then the year is 1081. This was a special gift and THE YEAR WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT but you ruined it.,Negative
"I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the product. I love the design and the sentiment, but not the material. I gave it as a gift to a good friend and the next day it was all tarnished. The chain looks terrible and like it has been worn for months when in fact it was worn 1 day. It is not worth the money and embarrassing to give as a gift.",Negative
It was so much smaller than I thought it would be. I was very disappointed.,Negative
Not impressed with the quality of material or craftsmanship. Very disappointing as I was hoping to add more. Glad I only bought one.,Negative
Changes colors fast😒,Negative
"This was advertised as a bandana. It's not a bandana. It's a triangular piece of cloth with two strings attached - not a true bandana. Also, I ordered Large, and what I got had tie strings that would hardly fit around the next of a chihuahua, much less a big dog! I would never trust products by this company again",Negative
"Very disappointed with this item, no scent at all!",Negative
Cheap material !,Negative
"These were much bigger than I had thought, and my wife didn't care for them too much because of the size.",Negative
I saved these earrings as a gift and they were not taken out of the box until the end of November. I never expected to see the chips and black marks. One earring is fine the other is not. I am out of my window for exchange but would like to have the opportunity to exchange if possible.,Negative
They substituted a different towel. I'm very disappointed. I don't like this other towel at all. Different picture with different saying.,Negative
"The title said this was a set of two. I wasn’t sure if they meant 1 handle and one for the opposite side lifting handle, or 2 handle protectors, but only one handle protector arrived, so please don’t be mislead and disappointed by the item description like I was.",Negative
"Disappointed that it is only photo prints. Not on canvas, not framed, nothing! I would not have paid that amount for photo prints.",Negative
This bracelet is very small not the size a man would wear. I was disappointed as it was a Christmas gift that I could not return. Be careful and know the size is for a woman!!!!,Negative
"The product smells super strong in the bottle -almost very chemical like. I followed the instructions on the bottle, but there was no smell upon hitting the water and there was so little salt used (and none of it actually the beneficial bath salt) that the bath wasn't as pleasant. I hate to give a small business a bad review, but this formulation needs to be revised.",Negative
"It's literally a printed piece of paper that was laminated. You could 100% make this at home if you have a printer, NOT worth paying what they're charging for it.",Negative
"Like tons of others who did not read the product details carefully enough, I expected this to be metal.  It is printed on photograph paper.  Now I have to frame it.  The thing that bothers me the most about it is that I have doubts that the actual artist was involved in this transaction.  For all I know I just overpaid an art thief.  What a racket!  The octopus model probably wasn’t paid either.  At least it is a wonderful image.",Negative
Was very cheap,Negative
They look amazing but it’s already peeling off of my window. I barely had them on my car for 2 weeks before they started peeling off.,Negative
"smells horrible, threw mine in trash.",Negative
Very small wasn’t what I expected did a girls night painting everyone thought painting was too small should go up a size,Negative
"Cute soap, but didn’t work. It stayed in little clumps and did not wash out easily. It’s my first experience with non-bottle shampoo. And, my last.",Negative
The clasp sucks.<br />It broke even putting it on to see it.<br />Return for sure!!,Negative
The necklace was so small my 7yr old is wearing it. It's too bad I like the necklace too.,Negative
These were the most uncomfortable earrings I have ever bought. Within minutes of putting them on my ears started to itch! They turned red and started flaking the next day. One clasp came undone and I lost it and eventually found it. Don’t buy if you’re allergic to fake jewelry or have sensitive ears.,Negative
"I loved the size of the disk and length of the chain, but very disappointed that the rings holding the disks on have already tarnished after a few short wears. Allergic to silver and can only wear when gold plating is true.",Negative
This item is on glossy paper and the price is to high. I have gotten tin signs for the price I paid for this item .,Negative
Small tear on corner hoping frame will hide it,Negative
"Too expensive for how cheap it looks! I feel like I could have just made this myself, really disappointed with how it turned out.",Negative
Cheaply made!,Negative
This looks like it was printed on a home printer.,Negative
Godd,Negative
"The shirt itself fit poorly, I didn’t even wear it for my bday. I was pretty upset about that.....",Negative
"I am disappointed, once I tried to frame it, I don’t like that the font looks too thin, can be better. I don’t recommend this one.",Negative
"They did say print only, unframed. The weight of the prints was nice, the pictures are as expected. They were not something we could use upon arrival. Framed nicely might be good for you all though.",Negative
"What's good - Really fast delivery - thank you!<br />  - Good quality leather.<br /><br />But inner part of the wallet's skin makes a fold once you are closing it and that fold pushing back the wallet. Basically it will be always open, unless it's in your pocket. Not what I expected, especially for this money. Probably I got unlucky and received unsuccessful model - I do not know. But I am disappointed",Negative
After wearing this bracelet for 3 weeks the beads and string broke.,Negative
"I no longer have this nose ring because on the last occasion I tried to wear it, it finally fell off and got lost.  Not comfortable whatsoever and doesn't stay unless you actually squeeze it tight enough to actually have a pierced nose! Haha!!",Negative
"This is a wildly popular holster. I bought it since it was on sale and I had other products from them. This time, I am disappointed. The product is very bulky making on belt carry feel/look silly. It lacks any refinement on the edges and is just a massive rectangle. The clip juts out so the bottom of the holster is flapping. Being a piece of plastic, it does not feel like it will last. I find myself bumping this holster into things at random, it is so bulky. I would return it but not worth the hassle.",Negative
Just instagram and twitter. thought it would be variety pack,Negative
"Ring fits perfect. You can’t read the name on it tho, so I find that pretty disappointing. I have to feel the ring to know the name is still there. Great delivery time. Just kind of defeats the purpose when I can’t see the name.",Negative
"Had an obvious machine-made scratch on the face.  Very amusing (and accurate) sentiment - and appropriate - and  having smiled and appreciated the sentiment initially -  my wife decided (at 45) that she is now a prude so stated it was ""rude, vulgar and nasty"" therefore,  discarded it! ^^",Negative
These earrings were so pretty online and when I received them they were sooo small that you couldn't really see the stones and are hard to put on because they are so tiny. These earrings would be fine for a small child but not for an adult.  Very disapointed.,Negative
You can’t really see the engraving it’s very light. It looks cheap. I’m pretty disappointed,Negative
The product was fine except to of the stones came off,Negative
"Very cheap stuff, not worth the money",Negative
My 17 yr old loved it bu the chain broke the next day:(,Negative

Misleading picture,Negative
I wear earrings all the time and this is the very first time I've run into this problem - as pretty as these earrings are I cannot get even the tip of the post part of the earring into my earlobe.,Negative
"The metal was not sanded, the edges are rugged and can cut you. Cheap and overpriced.",Negative
It was nice for a week and then it broke.<br /> So I would not recommend this product. It's sad because we really liked it.,Negative
WEAK HIGHLIGHTS,Negative
"Absolutely a joke!!! Ours doesn’t work right, it just pulses but the colors don’t change so unless you happen to be looking straight at it… you won’t notice. WASTE OF MONEY. we wanted it for our 3 year old who has a deployed parent.",Negative
"When I received these glittery seashells, I was disappointed.  To me they look rather plebeian.  Instead of using them, I gave them to an 8-year-old who thought they were beautiful.",Negative
"Too fragile, smaller than expected, and quality is styrofoam....poor.",Negative
This looks like a pic printed at a one hour photo shop. Definitely not worth $11.95+tax.,Negative
Looks NOTHING like what I got in the mail. Looks TERRIBLE.,Negative
did not smell like pine,Negative
"Very frail, broke easily. Should be sold for less.",Negative
I got a size too big oops  that’s my fault lol but it changed colors where I’m nose touches it and it got really bad after a few weeks! I can no longer wear it anymore due to the nasty color it turned definitely not worth it. Wish I could give zero stars!,Negative
I would not have purchased this item had I seen it in a store. Was very disappointed in sizing and clarity. Looked like a magic marker for engraving.,Negative
"The earings are cheap and flimsy. They look nice initially, but you have bend them to put them in your ears and then they lose their shape and do not bend back.",Negative
Craftsmanship is awesome but useless because it’s too small!!,Negative
It was chipped and look to use.,Negative
"Picture makes it look way bigger than it is, on top of that it ripped.",Negative
do not waste your money!!<br />Had to  re-glue all the pieces and she promised to ship me a new order but never did.,Negative
Does not stay in ear. Fell out within one hour,Negative
Wow wow wow wow the picture showed thickness but when I got them they just a piece of string. I was expecting a nice moderate size strings but this is so thin I can put it through a needle. Wow wow wow you got me this time.,Negative
It was regular printer ink on a touch nicer printer paper. Nothing special about it or &#34;poster&#34;-like. I guess I paid for the creative definition.,Negative
Is it supposed to turn black-ish after a few months?  My wife's c,Negative
These fell apart/came unglued with ing two weeks.,Negative
Ordered these for my head table. Would NOT have spent the money on these. Very cheap looking for the price and the shipping cost is ridiculous. I didn’t catch it when I hit submit. But no way would have paid $17 to ship these.,Negative
"They were silver,  not gold. Yes, I did order them correctly. So disappointed - the gold looked pretty in the picture",Negative
Smelled great in the package and came with a few simple wax melts.<br />Does not last long once it is melting and cant really smell it unless you are on top of it.,Negative
"I've ordered this item twice and both timed it broke a day later, the last time I ordered it it came already broken",Negative
a joke not worth it,Negative
"This necklace never star in place,  the heart pendant is always flipping up. Eventually I  stop wearing it.",Negative
Size and shape of ring doesn’t match the pictures given.,Negative
Very bulky ring.  This ring actually bruised my finger.  Returning is a hassle so I just threw it out!,Negative
Not worth the money. I can’t smell a thing. I even tried the free samples they sent. The only reason I purchased this is because it’s the only one made in the US. But steamers from other companies are a lot more powerful with nice aroma.,Negative
I give this a 1 just because only the tshirt came .didnt get the skirt or the teddy bear or nothing of what is in the pic!!! So i hade to stress matching with a skirt.. either then that the tshirt was ok,Negative
"Yes, like murdering babies. Make a Margaret Thatcher tshirt... now there’s an amazing woman.",Negative
"Received the completely wrong item, not even close.",Negative
"Loved it, but it broke after wearing it for one day. Can’t recommend.",Negative
It says 25 handfuls per bag. Doesn't look like 25 handfuls per bag. Bags were really small and not worth the money. We sent them back.,Negative
"Maybe my ears are too small, but I couldn't get them to stay in place even if I made them really tight.  Pretty, though. Wish they had worked",Negative
"""0"" star if available - cheap material and sent 80th instead of 40th and pink instead of black  :(",Negative
I liked at first but is just so cheap-looking next to my more expensive jewelry.  I gave away but kept the “chain” in case I needed it for something else.,Negative
So disappointed in this. I paid for a color on this board and it was damaged. Very shottie work for the price! Won't recommend,Negative
This product is a piece of paper stuck to a piece of cardboard and pin. Very disappointed. Not worth the money.,Negative
The print did not turn out vibrant and beautiful like the picture and the seller says it’s the material. So limited kinda of shirts/material you can use  I did use a hot press as it suggested,Negative
"They have a gritty textured surface making them hard to slide against each other while loading into a magazine.<br /><br />The first round that I attempted to load in my M57 jammed in the chamber and locked up the slide.<br /><br />When I was finally able to rack the slide back, the extractor ripped the entire rim off the rear of the round.<br /><br />I promptly unloaded them all out of my magazine and threw them in the trash.",Negative
Esta bonita pero la cadena se ve muy barata y de mala calidad,Negative
[[VIDEOID:f7096989c3f43b20dd7f873a40c00f8d]] These would be so beautiful if they were not damaged. They are damaged in the same place which makes me think it’s part of the process of making them into earrings. Paying $29 I expected better quality.,Negative
"Do not purchase, you will lose it and be sad. Would like to give no stars. The bar was very short. It did fit okay as far as the thickness of my piercing hole but the bar that bent was very short so it kept falling out of my nose. I lost it within 2 days of owning it. A complete waste of money. I am very disappointed.",Negative
"Not at all what I was expecting—very disappointed—if I didn’t know this was my first name, I wouldn’t recognize it. The first initial doesn’t even look like a “c” & the same tiny size as the rest of the letters—maybe there’s something I’m missing but I’m not impressed  :(",Negative
Horrible quality ! Not worth the money,Negative
"Not the colorful stone that was shown in pic.  Two of the<br />Pics are with full sun and one with LED lights.  When not in either it’s pretty drab.  Also while the wire work is beautiful,  there are many cut points that are sharp and caught<br />On clothing.  The rough stone takes away from the “fire” of it.  Really disappointed as this was for memorial situation.  Returning.",Negative
This item was so small I laughed out loud. Buyer beware!,Negative
I was disappointed in this product.,Negative
It is just a cardboard picture.,Negative
So thin the metal bends,Negative
It’s paper! I’m so disappointed. Not only that it doesn’t fit the water bottle.,Negative
I liked how the decal looked but the process of getting it to transfer to my mailbox was horrible! There needs to be something different come up with. If this is like any of my other negative comments it will not make it for other customers to see.,Negative

Smelt great but only lasted a couple weeks and started turning green and can barely smell it anymore.,Negative
"I was really optimistic about this iPad case. The reviews were good, the price was fair, and I was okay with the delayed shipping from China. It's been a few weeks since I received it in the mail and I haven't even been able to use it. The oil they used for the leather apparently doesn't dry...ever. I'm assuming they just used too much leather oil. I received it in the mail 15 days ago and it's still damp. I put a fan on it for 48 hours...still damp. I set it on a shelf in my garage where it's warm but not hot...still damp. I tried putting the case on my iPad but it leaves a thick film on the screen because the oil is so damp. I didn't leave the case on for more than 60 seconds. The case does look nice. If the case ever dries out, I will add another star to my review.",Negative
no scent,Negative
Pic showed fur on blanket. Mine did not have the fur. They will not return/exchange. Will never order from them again. Very disappointing.,Negative

When I first opened it I loved it ,but it truly is poor quality and would not recommend it all as it is a waste of money and lasts so little.",Negative

"I submitted my prescription measurements hoping to have an equivalent to a medical supply company but when it arrived it looked great! but... too wide and too long to fit and restrict the finger from over extension. I asked the seller if they would resize it as I saw others had the same issue... no response. After another week or so, I tried to contact the seller again but my only option was to return it without correction. I am very disappointed.",Negative
Very bad quality and flimsy. Did not sit straight on my nose at all. Not good value for money. It’s lightweight and to me that was the only good thing about it.,Negative
"The hoop does not close. Therefore, the feather pendant is always falling off or the earring is always completely falling out. There's no way to tighten the loop so that it doesn't fall out or to not loose the pendant.",Negative

The material is good and it looks good but unfortunately it doesn’t turn in ignition with it so I had to take it out. Didn’t serve it’s purpose,Negative

Not an adjustable chain very deceitful<br />Email is not right it does not accept sending message from company,Negative
Delivery took longer than average Amazon shipment!  Once actually got it disappointed in product.  Picture was very deceptive & to us over represented the product actually received.  Upon opening hour hand was not connected properly (flopped around) and both other hands were bent.  Had to reconnect the hour and  get the other hands bent back properly to get it working.  Definitely overpriced @ $32.90! Cannot recommend this item @ this price:(,Negative
The fabric is very thin.  Both of mine are torn and I definitely do not recommend buying.,Negative
"I don't really mind that the tractor itself was so lightweight as I bought it as a gift for the spare tractor key.  I am disappointed that the actual key ring itself is so flimsy.  If you purchase this, just know you don't want to use it for any primary keys, and probably only one spare key.",Negative
Very light weight and uncomfortable,Negative
Gave as gift to members of an organization with the similar logo & got one for myself. Very delicate - both chain & pendent. Priced well. Extremely pleased.<br /><br />Update: I had to return all 4 necklaces as the chains tarnished. Very dissapointing.,Negative
Not like the picture at all,Negative
I loved the scent but the coffee grounds are really messy in the shower.,Negative
read the size and it looks EVEN SMALLER. very dissapointed,Negative
The custom words are just ironed on and the date on the sleeve was not placed correctly. It arrived with the date on the lower sleeve cuff. Overall disappointed in this and would not recommend.,Negative
"It came with half the amount of screws, no pre-drilled holes, no stickers, and the screws aren’t even long enough to put the thing together.<br />Not worth the money paid for a few pieces of wood.<br /><br />Make sure u have your own screws & your own way to out this together successfully.",Negative
Pretty piece. Sadly not all the pieces came (stopper),Negative
These are useless. They aren’t absorbent at all. I literally cannot figure out what to use them for. They are pretty and soft. But won’t wipe your mouth off either.,Negative
"These were my favorite, stylish, fake nose rings that I ordered. They were cute, fairly comfortable, and stayed in place. Unfortunately, while the ring itself held up nicely, the decorative parts fell out within a few months. They need to secure them better before I would consider buying them again.",Negative
"Came in with May 2017 - May 2018<br />It's ordered in August 2017...  only May and June 2017 have expanded pages.  Will not order again!  Due to starting a new job in 2 days, cannot send back - need a calendar of some sort.",Negative
Not even close to what it shows it just a generic computer generated picture,Negative
"They are not as they appear in the picture and you can't return them.  I can't read clearly with them, it's like the lens is off.",Negative
He literally never said that in any of the movies?? This is not a captain jack sparrow quote,Negative
Hoping I get it threw the mail still I really love this,Negative
One wash and the ice blue shirt turned completely white.,Negative
Purchased this for myself. Love to have an aromatic candle burning.<br />It simply does not work with any matches.,Negative
"Returned it immediately, could not have been out of the box more than three minutes. It’s very bright and shiny and resembles a cheap countertop.",Negative
These necklaces were a lifesaver when getting my daughter to go to kindergarten. Unfortunately her chain broke the 2nd week she wore it.,Negative
"Difficult to put in the Fitbit and it doesn't register your sleep. I threw it away, not worth the effort of returning",Negative
It is too small. The colout and design is great but way too small.,Negative
Me and my best friend of 30 years have looked at these forever and I finally bought them as a surprise the first 2 weeks were amazing then BOTH units stopped working all together. I can't believe I am out that much money for nothing.,Negative
The pic with 3 stamps is what I was sent of how the stamp would look. the other 2 are what it looks like. It's blurry. I can't read my name clearly or the I was told I've used the wrong ink. It's water based ink that I use on all my stamps.  I did ask for and received a refund.,Negative
"I had high hopes for this product, I like the look of the design. I really wanted to like it. The problem is it’s made of an extremely lightweight material that causes it to tip over all the time. Taking glasses on and off it knock it off balance, lightly bumping against it causes it to tip. A simple solution would be a weighted base, which it doesn’t have. It is now broken since it tipped and crashed onto floor and broke apart. For the price, I would have been better buying a paper towel holder and sticky tape. Very disappointed, would not recommend buying. Gave it two stars instead one one since we did get a year worth of use out of ( even though it tipped all the time) before the final tipping broke it",Negative
Finding it hard to believe these are silver. Turned dark and hurt my ears,Negative
"I really liked this septum piercing and it looks lovely, but the circumference of the hoop is very small, so it's not very comfortable to wear. Also, you have to bend the hoop itself to ""open"" and ""close"" the jewelry, which makes it basically impossible to return it to the exact same shape and is also uncomfortable if the hoop gets twisted and the slightly open side gets in your nose.",Negative
I'm normally not like this but I almost bought this for myself until it said it was for men. I didn't realize Dungoen Masters couldn't be girls. Lol,Negative
Middle ring fell off after being worn three times.  I really like the look of it on but quality was disappointing,Negative
This is my second shampoo bar from Avitals and it is definitely NOT the same.  This one is super soft and is falling apart in my hands. I am storing it in the same open container with drainage and I do not keep it in the shower. Very disappointed,Negative
I thought this would be 4 pictures with frames because paying $17 seems a bit much for 4 pieces of paper,Negative
"I ordered this for a birthday gift.  I didn't realize until I received it, that is was just a paper print.  The cost for the ""print"" was much more than I think it should be.  Especially since it doesn't include a frame and I have that additional cost.  Don't recommend it.",Negative
Changing review. Already falling apart. Too expensive to be so poorly made. Do not waste your money.,Negative
[[VIDEOID:b79aeefbdc0aee2f4299bf5ee5ac9a77]] I ordered rose gold and got gold. The design is also so much bigger.,Negative
Not very well made. Busted first work out with my 11 month old Lab. I’d have say to spend more $$ get a good one. In order to get a refund they want you mail back with sand pouring out. Absolutely terrible customer service. Keep Looking,Negative
Not as awesome in person as on line,Negative
Started peeling at the bottom and is rolling up very annoying.,Negative
The vinyl is very thick and hard to handle.  The giant letter in the background of the picture  doesn't allow for the actual name to stick properly. Not worth the aggravation or money.,Negative
"I am thankful for my shepherd staffs but was spoiled by the finer craftsmanship of the first one which is six inches longer, much straighter, much thicker, and also quite functional. This latest staff that I received bends easily. The first staff is about perfectly round, straight and strong. It won’t bend. The latest one is thin, flat down the front and flat down the rear though the sides are rounded. It bends easily and I’m afraid it will break. Having received a less than satisfactory reply I must give this particular staff a low rating.",Negative
"Although these earrings looked cute online, they are designed poorly.  Too light weight to hang correctly and not secure.  Within the first 4 hours of wearing them (seriously) I had lost one.  VERY  expensive and disappointing.",Negative
"Pretty, just too heavy for my earlobes! Realized this after the Return time window,",Negative
Not worth the money or time wasted.,Negative
"order was late for mothers day. looked like all of 6 minutes were spent cutting the leather out, no instructions or suggestions on how to fix them to flip flops.",Negative
I purchased this specifically for a nurse who likes avocados. I received just an avocado badge reel. No nurse cap.,Negative
Pretty product but it came in ripped,Negative
"My son wanted this for school for his mask, not even had them a week and both of them broke at the metal clasp! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",Negative
"The stamp isn’t flexible at all, so when you try to use it on a rounded egg, the stamp cannot fully press on it, so half is missing every single time. I have this as a Christmas gift and it’s embarrassing 🙈",Negative
ALL METAL PARTS ARE COMPLETELY RUSTED,Negative
Sizing of the ring was off by a full size and ring began to tarnish within a week.,Negative
Not satisfied,Negative
"These earrings are so small they slipped right through my earring holes. Lost in a day. Cute design, but they need to be a little bit bigger.",Negative
Didn't realize this was plastic,Negative
"Don't waste your money. It's very thin and the edges were sharp, kept scratching and hurting. Not worth it, I would give zero stars if possible",Negative
"I only paid $2.66 for this so I am not too mad, but had I paid regular price I would return it. The pictures are very misleading. You would think it is a 3d ornament, but sadly it is a flat piece of cardboard just like the paper tree air fresheners. It is cutr, but definitely not worth the original price.",Negative
junk. arrived all bentvcoming off the backing ugh ... just junk dont waste your money,Negative
This item was not as big as it appeared and the material is awful! The design is nice but don’t wash it w other items bc it runs.,Negative
The product needs more essential oils that are listed on the packaging. I buy these oils regularly and know how they smell and their benefits. I smell goldenseal but not the frankinsense or myrrh.<br />Add more to the product.,Negative
All this is is a thin piece of paper a page ripped out of a dictionary and then they print it the Eiffel Tower in Paris on the front of it it is so paper thin it is not a by 8x10 the measurements are off completely! Oh my goodness don't waste your money I'm sorry it probably cost the guy $0.50 to make why are you gouging people!,Negative
Cute but I had to break off the ball at the end!!! This thing is so fat I couldn't put it in!!,Negative
"Cheaply made, not correct length, so thin, chain is terrible looking, just horrible all in all.",Negative
 ,Negative
Cute but the chain are weak and it came a little scratched up. Will be replacing the link and filling in the scratches one a later date but other than it will work,Negative
I can print this for 5 cents on my printer - same exact quality.  Returning.  Such a huge disappointment.,Negative
total rip off. A sticker for $7,Negative
The scent is wonderful but the soap doesn't reduce dark spots. I'm very disappointed 😞.,Negative
Easy to wear,Negative

"With just one week till our 50th anniversary the poster arrived in a flimsy package that resulted in it being bent and creating creases and wrinkling of the poster.  No time to reorder, leaving me to either display the messed up poster or leave the space I planned to display it a blank wall.  I have it under our dining room rug, hoping to flatten it our enough to adhere to foam board.  Very sad.<br /><br />The two stars are because it is cute - would have been great.",Negative
The neck line looks awful. It’s all scrunched up.,Negative
Gave to my grandson for his birthday he’s a excellent welder,Negative
This is not framed. It's something you could make and print at Kinkos for under $2. Not at all worth $14.95. And they don't accept returns.,Negative
"Although I like the look of these..The earrings are pressed wood, not solid wood.. one of the earrings broke the first day as how I realized they weren’t solid wood..Sadly I wouldn’t buy these again ..",Negative
Is what I expected but necklace fell apart right away.,Negative
overpriced for an operating time if 4seconds...,Negative

"Item arrived defective. Shipping box wasn’t damaged, but even in a page protector, the sign was marred completely through the front & back. I have zero desire to attempt to return it during this season of chaos, since the nearest UPS store is at least half an hour away. Was hoping to have a meaningful Christmas present for our kids to wake up to…some new encouraging decor.",Negative
Just arrived. I really can’t say if it is real gold or not. But i can’t see anywhere the 14 k mark,Negative
These show the color sparkling in the picture I received clear stones no fire not worth the money,Negative
Came torn!,Negative
It just wasn’t what I expected.,Negative
The width is not 1.81 inches. It's 1.50 inches.,Negative
So cheap. Just not worth the price,Negative
"Made cheap, disappointing, had bought for sister",Negative
This review is for the product not the seller.<br />The colors were not vibrant. A California poppy should be orange. I received brown colored poppies. The seller did refund my money.,Negative
Letters are very rigid as you can see in pictures posted. They look as though they were not done right on the vinyl machine. Not recommended. Looks like a 5 year old scribbled it.,Negative
This “nose ring” looked like a thin piece of cheap wire twisted to look like a nose ring. Could’ve made it myself. Terrible quality.,Negative
Dissatisfied with quality of the opal turned dark brown and I just missed the return cutoff . Now stuck with something I won’t wear !,Negative
I got this to keep in my purse<br /><br />It doesn’t smell anything like my authentic bottle and it’s too light doesn’t even last an hour. I would try another company.,Negative
ordered this ring twice and both times it came looking little like the picture. it was a “washed” version of what appeared in the photograph with none of the crisp detailing i was expecting. unusual  for a Novica product.,Negative
This looks like a pic printed at a one hour photo shop. Definitely not worth $11.95+tax.,Negative
These earrings are no where near worth what I paid from them. It is as if I got them at the dollar stores,Negative
"Thought it was framed. It should note that in the title to make it as clear as possible. I see it is in the description now. It's neat, but I wouldn't pay this much unframed.",Negative
False advertisement! My shirt came without any distressed look! It had no holes! This brand I got 2 T-shirts from and both were false advertisement!! Both shirts I received from this company did not have holes or a distressed look!!,Negative
These are just ok.  They don’t stay in very well and I end up finding them all over house where they have fallen off.,Negative
"It is not pretty as it looks on the picture, and could not place it since it bend and it does not have the same shape anymore",Negative
It's too small to even fit a nose. Good for kids. Not for adults.,Negative
"This poster is cute but does stay up. It’s expensive too plus you have to pay almost 8 dollars for shipping. Your look at spending close to 40$ for something that does not stick. It fell off the wall and got all rolled up during the night and picked up residue and stuff from my carpet and is no good now. I tried opening it carefully and it’s messed up . For the money I spent, it’s not worth it. I wanted to buy another one but it’s too expensive for something that does not stick. I’m very disappointed.",Negative
Did not receive the brand tee that was shown in the picture. It did not fit and was of poor quality.  No refunds with this seller!,Negative
This isn't the correct verse,Negative
It wasn’t what I wanted. It only came in months.,Negative
The flowers were blurry. What a disappointment.,Negative
"Fine and functional.. necklace strand barely goes around my wrist, much less my neck, and to cut it would damage the flimsy loop that connects to the pendant.. returning with regret",Negative
Nice looking knight thsts grest for displaying but showed up extremely dull and the steel is very soft<br />I was expecting a functional product and was extremely disappointed in discovering its more for displays,Negative
The GILDAN HEAVY COTTON shirt looks nothing like the shirt pictured. The GILDAN neckline is not at all scooped as this picture shows. Nor is the sleeve folded up. And the tag in the shirt pictured is not the GILDAN HEAVY COTTON shirt I received. I am very displeased with this purchase.,Negative
"Bought two products like this. This one did not adhere well, while another one that I bought Adhered right away.",Negative
"This bracelet was bought for my junior bridesmaid and I was so excited to give it to her. Unfortunately, it arrived broken and I was very disappointed to see that it was cheaply made.",Negative
It is very complicated to get in and then reshape,Negative
Wish I would've order a bigger sticker so that's my fault but the font was not the font that I had requested.,Negative
Do not buy this. It is a one sided 8 X 10 document that is not worth the price.,Negative
"It might just be me, but I really didn’t enjoy this. It feels very cheap and doesn’t do much to help with my picking issues. It doesn’t pick easily at all and the materials are just not really great. I really wanted to like this. It’s a great idea, but the quality could be better.",Negative
"It was SUPER warped. I couldn’t fix it, even with my tools. It just looked really off. I returned it. The stone was pretty, though.",Negative
I missed my return time frame for this otherwise I would have returned it. This is a 3D printed item which is fine had it been the correct size. Would not recommend if needing to fit a 6” adapter.,Negative
Brass eyelet started tearing through on first use. Seams came apart and all the sand came out after a week of light use. Would not recommend.,Negative
"Very weak matchsticks; breaks upon striking. Tiny bottle (only about 2"" tall);  don't be fooled by size as I was.  Pretty to display is only nice thing about my experience with this product. Wish I had not spent the money on this.",Negative
Poor quality,Negative
"I received this as a gift. I like the content, but it is just printed on photo paper. If I had purchased it myself, I would absolutely return it.",Negative
"This box is deceptively small, less than 6”square. My sister was happy with it but I was disappointed for the cost.",Negative
Color is way off. The letters are peeling off.,Negative
This is an ok ring I mean there was nothing actually wrong with it. It was just wider than I wanted. It’s not really dainty.,Negative
"Very soft, nice material, not very breathable. I bought this for my son and their ridiculous mask policy at school. You can still feel your hot breath all over your face.",Negative
I am on my second ine and it keeps breaking. Its very disappointing.,Negative
"Looked great, but gunked up my nose. I was a little frustrated with that since I was under the impression that this was a quality metal, but you get what you pay for.",Negative
Colors don't match photo displayed.  The colors are brighter and more saturated in the photo...much duller in person.,Negative
one is bright white with marbling the other is gray and no marbling. they do not match at all.,Negative
Too bandy.<br />It bands too much and feels so cheap,Negative
I didn't read the other reviews close enough. This is literally a piece of paper that I could have printed myself.,Negative
"I wanted to get a nose print of my dog before she died, but the ""putty"" that you are supposed to use must have been old. When I followed the directions to soften it up it just became harder and consequently, I was not able to get a decent nose print from my dog. She soon passed afterwards, and I spent money on this--for nothing.",Negative
I bought it for my gate It's got part of a paint chipped off of it on the edges 03 sides,Negative
Took FOREVER to come in and it wasn't big enough for my sons wrist.....,Negative
When I got it I was so excited because it was so nice but shortly after putting it on my keychain I realized the black ink was smudging all over the leather. I would go with another company.,Negative
The necklace is beautiful but broke within the first week of wearing it:(,Negative
Christmas gift for granddaughter was to large for her,Negative
This dress is really cute but I didn’t get it. My order was canceled for no reason and it was too late to order something new. My original review would not post so I’m trying to be nice but I wouldn’t order if I was you,Negative
"Probably should have read the reviews first. I was expecting something metal for it to be ""LPL style.""<br /><br />For the price, plastic makes more sense, but the quality is pretty lame. It's poorly a poor quality 3D print job. It feels incredibly cheap, and the ""resolution"" is pretty terrible. It's covered in coarse lines all over.<br /><br />Just buy your own 3D printer and make your own. Then you'll have a 3D printer!",Negative
The nice part is they sent a replacement so you get two stickers. But within a week they both came off. They don’t fit through square readers. So they both can right off.,Negative
Should have read more closely. I believe this is an 8x10. Totally not worth price.,Negative
Shocked and disappointed it was not assembled!!!  No where did it say this was an art project.  Very disappointed there is not enough nylon wire to put it together myself.  I do not recommend!!,Negative
this was really bad i followed the directions and i could not even get it on my wall. this is a huge waste of money. do not get,Negative
Very cheaply made sticker,Negative
I really didn’t like the smell if these wax melts.  It was a flowery-sucky-sweet smell that was very overpowering.  I have tried a different scent with this same brand and it wasn’t quite as bad.,Negative
I suggest to consumers avoid this purchase.,Negative
My daughter has been wearing it for 15 days but it started tarnishing within days. I know it was $20 but I've bought necklaces for the same price and they look brand new after 3 months of wearing. O wouldn't purchase or give as a gift.,Negative
These earrings would not stay on.  One earring would not even go on at all.  Thought the invisible clasp would be great but it wasn’t functional at all.  Very disappointed.,Negative
"It was cute and looked nice, but the black edges rubbed off onto everything (hands, paper, purse, you name it). You can’t have a keychain that gets everything dirty that it touches. Pretty disappointed in this product.",Negative
Really flimsy. Feel like they will break easily.,Negative
Se rompió el mismo día que lo use,Negative
my piece is already scratched up and I have wore it for three weeks,Negative
"The custom lettering is nice,  however the case is junk.  I have never broken a phone and after having this on for 2 weeks,  my new phone is now broken.",Negative
Please read the description. The picture is deceiving. I failed to read the description. I could use my color printer and get the same results.,Negative
"I was disappointed with this purchase. I thought from the photos that it would look more distressed wood...or even would appear more like a 3-d raised wood frame. It's just a big magnet. Which is still cute, but definitely not worth $20+.",Negative
Very expensive to come with such a cheap chain.  It broke before my daughter in law could even wear it.  The little charm was nice but way too much money for just a small charm.,Negative
I thought the text was going to be black and it’s not also the colors aren’t as vibrant as shown in the picture and it looks dirty/rusted almost,Negative
"I am so sad that this is such a rip off.  You could just get a piece of card stock and open a word document, type these words and press print.  There is nothing special about this print and it's not framed as it's shown in the picture.  I am beyond disappointed with this.  DON'T BUY.",Negative
The golf ball came out in the freezer,Negative
The ornament was squeezed into a box that didn't quite fit.  i am surprised it didn't break.  It is  cheaply made and looks a lot nicer on the website.,Negative
It is not like the advertised picture! It is very flimsy and cheap quality! I asked for a refund and they would not give me a refund. Please do not waste your money. Only go part was quick shipping.,Negative
Very cute but two days in and it broke disappointing,Negative
The writing peeled off the first day!!,Negative

"This nose ring is super cute and easy to put on. However, after less than a month of use, it has tarnished considerately on the inner parts of the loop. It’s not super noticeable, but I know it’s there, and it looks dirty.",Negative
Poor quality,Negative
"[[VIDEOID:9f7a2b0221d04f614099caaa43e60010]] My initials are ERL. I put my initials in the order that was asked when I put in the customization info. I was thinking since the L was in the middle and the first letter of my last name, it would be bigger than the other letters. It wasn't.  Now it looks like my initials are ELR. I'm so irritated. Smh. The badge reel came the same way.",Negative
The darn hot glue fell off on one side! I paid extra to get the hanging hook feature,Negative

Not impressed,Negative
Not worth the value,Negative
These are so much smaller than described. I measured mine and mine aren't even 11 inches long. Paid way too much money for a block of wood and mason jar. I could have done a better job making this myself.,Negative
"I have had these earrings in my wishlist for over a year and finally decided to buy them for myself, so I was beyond disappointed when I received them. I opened them and instantly noticed that they are completely tarnished! I ordered silver on silver, but as you can see from the picture they are not silver! I was also disappointed by the look of them, they are much larger than I was expecting and they look cheaply made. I will be returning for a refund because even if they weren’t tarnished I am not happy with them.",Negative
Poor Quality,Negative
"My wife lived the bracelet and wore it daily. Not even a year into it, it broke. Poor quality for the price. Not good.",Negative
Small af,Negative
"When I first reviewed this ring I gave it 5 stars and said it was exactly what I wanted.  Well I have changed my mind.  When I first recieved this ring it was a beautiful shiny gold. I wore it for an hour then put it back in the box it came in.  A few days later when I go to wear the ring, to my surprise it is now a tarnished almost copper gold.  Very dissapointed.  Bought a similar ring from different seller and same thing happened.  No more gold filled rings for me.",Negative
Not worth the price. Looks very cheap and has dents on the pendant.,Negative
It’s a bad copied print of a print. Don’t waste your money.,Negative
Gave this to my granddaughter for her 16th birthday and the chain broke as she was putting it on. Would not recommend. It was beautifully packaged but what a disappointment.,Negative
It’d be 5 stars if Santa CLAUS wasn’t misspelled. There is no “e” in Claus.,Negative
Stone broke where wire goes thtough it. . It was beautiful. Daughter was disappointed. Don't buy the one with wire going through it.,Negative

No framing. It’s just a print.,Negative
"I had this item in a wish list for ages...was very disappointed that the design I received is very different (seller calls this variation result of hand making something, but as I design person myself who has worked in jewelry some...uh, no). Additionally, the flower design is a pretty thin cut-out just tacked onto the top of a cylinder band which is not the craftsmanship I was hoping for.",Negative
"I was expecting something nice, but they were printed copies.<br />Some effort on my side - I could have printed these myself.",Negative
The necklace is beautiful but the clasp doesn't hold and continues to fall off. So now I have a bunch of beautiful moonstone beads I need to repurpose.,Negative
"Are you serious. How is cutting up a Bible a holy thing to do? Also, I don't even believe that is what's happening here. They are printing out Bible versus, and selling them for WAY too much because any price is too much. They are taking advantage of your religious beliefs. Stop! Full stop! Jesus would not like this.",Negative
Got this for my mom and we both love it! It was so cool to see the light change when the other person was thinking of you. Setup was nothing: you pretty much just plug it in and it works. Awesome! ...for about 4 months. Then they stopped connecting and just stopped working. Now they’re useless. So yeah—super cool while they last. Unfortunately they don’t last very long at all. Just came home one day and it wasn’t working. I expected them to hold up a lot longer than just 4 months!,Negative
The roller ball wouldn’t move and I couldn’t get the product to come out. It had leaked in the package and all over my purse. At least they smell good,Negative
Printed photo with no frame. Should have bought a frame and printed this myself for much cheaper. What a scam.,Negative
the gold decal could not be seen on the blue shirt the decal should have been black or white so that it could be seen,Negative

"I fell in love with this brand years ago and was so excited when I found this on Amazon. I used to buy it from a special botanical shop here in the city. When I saw the price, I was even more excited.<br /><br />My original bottle fell and broke, so I decided to go online to the original website to purchase. I decided to purchase from Amazon as the seller is the actual company and not a reseller.<br /><br />Problem 1: They advertise this is using olive oil from their farm.<br /><br />Problem 2: They don’t use olive oil, as they use Sunflower oil which is a hormone disruptor and much cheaper than olive oil. They lied about being made with olive oil.<br /><br />Problem 3: The scent is nothing like the one I fell in love with years ago. This néw sunflower oil based one has no scent and dies down within in 5 mins.<br /><br />I’m extremely disappointed and was really forward to supporting this business, but they changed the formula to a cheaper and less quantity ingredients",Negative

Shirt was too bog,Negative
Ordered this ring on July 5 and have worn regularly since then.  Today (Aug 31) the middle diamond fell out. No clue where it is. Loved wearing this ring and disappointed that the setting wasn’t sturdier.,Negative

"Awkward chain extension and no way to replace the chain if broken. Otherwise, the bobble is 7-10. Not worth the money, imo",Negative
"I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.",Negative
This thing is so small. Smaller the my finger for $8 what a joke. I’ll never buy anything for this place again.,Negative
"If you look closely, the full moon picture is signed on the moon itself. It looks completely out of place. I initially thought I had been sent return photos that had been written on.<br />Great pics if you don’t mind the signature.",Negative
"This hoop is horrible. Its smaller than what I says it is. Would be good if it was a little bigger. Hugs my nose too much. When trying to adjust it, it feels it may break easy.",Negative

"Its pretty yes, but wayyyy to small. It kept falling out of my nose :(",Negative
I received my canvas a few days ago and I was so excited when I seen it was close to arriving. But when I received the package was way smaller than the picture on Amazon makes it look. So I was disappointed that it was smaller than I expected and it cost me $120 for something that was a print out of a picture. I would’ve been OK with it if I paid $50 for it at max before $120 and how the Display picture makes it seem it’s very disappointing when it’s not anything like that.,Negative
Not as pictured: very jagged edges on the flyer de lie scroll.,Negative
The treble clef is backwards,Negative
"Ordered this based on the picture. Definitely NOT as described. For one, the color pictured (heather grey) is not what I received. It is a very light grey. Also the material is HORRIBLE. I've felt sand paper softer than this shirt. It is not at all flattering either. It's just a big body shirt.<br /><br />I also reached out to the seller to return this item and they never responded.",Negative
These are two pieces of regular paper. I'm pretty sure it's printed on a normal printer. Not worth the money.,Negative
It’s pretty cheap feeling. I wore it for one day. Started to hurt my ear. Took it out and threw it away.,Negative
I absolutely LOVED this nose ring at first. It was thin and snug. Literally everything I’d been looking for. After about two weeks my nose became sore and red. I tried to take a pic of it but you can’t see the bump. It’s right inside my nose piercing. I removed the nose ring and white pus came out. If it was real it wouldn’t have caused a reaction. Hopefully mine was just a cheap fluke and the others wouldn’t be. Very sad because I loved this nose ring,Negative
Didn't see anywhere in the description of the to ring that we would have to do some bend/twisting on it before it can be worn.<br />The one I received could be done with just my fingers I had to use a jewelry tool on it.,Negative
"Poor quality, made of paper not cardboard, very thin",Negative

Poor quality; not as described.,Negative
Smaller than it appears.,Negative
The stone came smaller than my pinky fingernail and the silver wrapped around it to hold in place covers pretty much the entire thing. It is also so pale it looks white. I got an amethyst for my husband from a different seller maybe should have tried them.,Negative
"Just got the bag, and it's beautiful. Seems sturdy, will post updates after my summer travels !<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />The bag was beautiful at first, got many compliments ... but straps always came done. I left my bag in Portugal because I got tired of having to redo the buckles ... waste of money, unfortunately !",Negative
"This watch band is gorgeous, the stones are even more pretty than in the pictures.  But they band does not fit snug no matter how I try to arrange it and suck it down and that causes my watch to not lay flat on my wrist and it thinks I am not wearing it and requires password over and over again.  It's also very difficult to put on.",Negative
I did not like these earrings because they Re way too small.,Negative
Seriously!? I could of just printed this myself at home… waste of money.,Negative
I need to know who is paying 300 dollars for a pencil skirt.... real talk??,Negative
There is nothing inside to hold the air pods you just CRAM YOUR CASE INSIDE THIS ONE i guess. This is a .15 cent item at best. Her name has a capitol L in it not lower case also.,Negative
I returned these earrings as they were very small.  It would have been helpful if the seller had put a coin to the side of the earrings giving some perspective as to the size.  They may work for a small/young child.,Negative
"Color is not a bright green as shown. Its a soft blue color, very disappointed.",Negative
Waste of time,Negative
Did not like these earrings. They hardly looked red at all.<br />Very dull color for sure.<br />Returned them.,Negative

"I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46. I did contact the vendor but got no response after waiting two weeks to write this review.",Neutral
"While cute,this ring is very cheaply made and unfinished. Most of the edges are actually sharp. I used an emery board to 'fix' mine. Not good business. I expected better from my beloved Alaska😥",Neutral
I wanted this necklace for years! I finally bought it for myself.<br /> My biggest complaint is upon arrival it took my at least an hour to unravel the chain. There is no reason I should have to spend the amount of time getting the chain apart from itself.<br />Another huge issue is two weeks later I notice when I went to put the necklace on it seemed to be tarnished a bit on the WW piece. It had been hanging up alone and there is no reason in two weeks it should be 'tarnished' so quickly. It's sterling but I have had pieces that sit for months and months that don't need cleaned. I have fake pieces even that don't change.<br />This wasn't a 10 or 20 dollar piece. If I hadn't waited so very long for this piece and had such high hopes and didn't pay over 30 dollars for it I wouldn't be so harsh on my review. But I was so excited about this for so long to get this for myself for so many reasons and for it not to be better quality upon arrival is very disappointing.,Neutral
"Product is beautiful, and they did an excellent job on the font and color, but I wish it was a little bigger and the date on mine was incorrect. I have enough time to order another, but it’s a bummer that we have to order twice. Hoping for a correct one this time",Neutral
Smaller than I expected. Doesn’t match my other rings that are supposed to be the same size. Was super cute but painful to wear because it was too small.,Neutral
So far my problem is I got married on 9/18/02 but I can only enter in 9 digits in the box so I can only do 9/18/2 which makes no sense.,Neutral
"A bit big, and bulky, but it's okay.",Neutral
Awesome logo. But poor quality shirt.,Neutral
loved the saying and the background... what I had a problem with and why it doesn't have 5 stars is the paper it is on is so fragile and thin that I haven't been able to take it out of the sleeve it was delivered in,Neutral
[[VIDEOID:b42aad7b055dce09dc01974ebfc8040e]] I would’ve given five stars until I received my second batch and they were falling apart and sloppy made. The way they were packaged ruined the rings. The first group I received were absolutely perfect and beautiful. So now I have to switch my stars down to three since the company is not consistent,Neutral
Very small like I wanted. The ends of ring are rough and hurt really bad when it kept getting stuck in the piercing hole. I had to replace it with another ring it. Fighting with it was overwhelming.,Neutral
"I should've read the reviews before, but all this is, is a print out laminated with sticky velcro circles attached.  It is the size of a standard piece of paper.  This is something I could've easily done on my own.",Neutral
It's a gift for my son.  The artwork is very nice.  The mailer was bent on the corner and such a shame. I have weighed it down to try and smooth it out before I Frame it.  Maybe use another type of mailer.,Neutral
"Cute gift, but chain too thin and easily tangled.. much tinier than pictured.",Neutral
Bigger than I thought,Neutral
"Size and feel of ring is too small, cheaply made. Onyx is very small, silver is thin and feels brittle. Feels like the kind of ring you'd get out of a gumball machine. Disappointed",Neutral
"I was SO excited to receive this item. I had been looking for a while for a wood record table, which would also hold albums. I was even more ecstatic because it was handmade in the USA. I prefer to support local small businesses and products made in the USA. I didn't realize when I ordered it, the actual height and size of it would be so small and short. Honestly, I can adapt to the furniture size being small but it is ETREMELY small in height. I can sit in a regular chair, and it hits right about the same height. I did order the 12inch hairpin legs, which was my mistake. I should have gone with longer ones. In hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. However, I expect something to be advertised if both small enough to either fit in a kid's room or an adult's living room. I would have ordered accordingly. I am in search of longer hairpin legs. As it is now, I have to bend over to play an album and practically sit on the floor to search through the albums in the stand. Otherwise, quality of workmanship and woodworking were simple, classic clean lines just as I wanted.",Neutral
"I returned this product. It had two noticeable smears of white paint. I contacted seller and she did refund the money. However, she did say she didn't see anything wrong with the item and it was a old barn look. To me it looks like two clear lines of paint. (See pictures)",Neutral
"Stones fall off when wet or if you nap/sleep with this on. I unfortunately was not the recipient of the care instructions that indicated this.<br /><br />Edit: the seller did work with me and for that, the 3 stars.  I struggle with how long this necklace might last with the constant taking on/off to avoid sweat/water/etc.",Neutral
"Pros : price, function, two-sided, attractive<br /><br /> Cons: cord is short and hard to get over my  head. Wish it was longer, my fault for not reading entire description. Would be nice if the cord came in different lengths.",Neutral
The picture on each balloons came out really nice but I filled them up with the helium tank that you would buy from Walmart and the balloons didn’t float at all. I guess they were made out of a heavy material or there’s a different helium to use? They were still a hit at my daughters 21st but I which they would of floated… I was a little bummed about that. We just put tape on the back and stuck them to the walls. But great picture quality on the balloons.,Neutral
This spray smells divine. The only issues I have is that this dried my hair and scalp out instead of moisturize. I've used on damp hair and dry hair...same results so now I use it with other products combination.,Neutral
"It’s a cute little match holder - but doesn’t strike the matches (strike anywhere matches) very well - I’ve broken multiple in half just trying different angles and applying more pressure to get them to light. Slightly disappointed because it’s a little pricey to be only decorative, the idea is neat though",Neutral
"I bought some of these for my wife. I have been purchasing solid colognes for myself through Duke Cannon and thought these might be the femal equivalent.<br /><br />And they are, but they are very tiny. Yes, you could easily fit it in the tiniest of purses, but you could also lose it in the tiniest of purses.<br /><br />These are just big enough you could get a fingertip in them.<br /><br />The scent is okay. Nothing revolutionary.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it’s a solid ‘meh’.",Neutral
"I thought this bag would be deeper, but it's not bad for storing one type of makeup, like all your brushes or all your lippies. The lettering is well applied; I imagine it will hold up well.",Neutral

I know the picture is 3 but there is only 1 in the order. But it is just as cute as the picture.,Neutral
"It looks good and came very fast. But it's personalized it asks for the name so I put Brian like I needed.  But they didn't add the "" 's "" don't you think you would assume to put that?",Neutral
I was really enjoying my case but literally three days after having it on my phone the lettering began to chip which made me realize It wouldn’t be long before it chipped off entirely. As I’m reading the comments and see that only few people have had this problem I’ll make the assumption that the manufacturers are most likely NOT consistent with their materials. So maybe they temporarily substitute products when they run out of their normal ones 🤷🏽‍♀️Idk,Neutral
Love the earrings.  Just what I was looking for.  Only problem was that there were only 3 earring backs in the package so I cannot wear them right away.,Neutral
Reviews were right...cute but overpriced.,Neutral
Beautiful piece...modern edge,Neutral
It's cute. Could be a little bigger,Neutral
A little large for a nose ring,Neutral
"This is nice, but very small",Neutral
"I got this for my daughter as a special gift with our song lyrics on it And although it was nice to find someone to engrave so nicely and so fast I was really sad that it looked cheap. It doesn’t have a nice 14k look it looks more like 24k or just fake because it was a lot darker and won’t match her other jewelry. It’s a nice keepsake I guess, cuz I know it’s going right in the jewelry box and staying there.",Neutral
"Bought as a white elephant present. Not a very high-quality towel. Almost more like a linen or a cheese cloth, was expecting something more durable for the price. But the recipient enjoyed the message on it so I guess that's what matters.",Neutral
It's ok. Expensive for the quality and size,Neutral
Its small. Should have gotten a larger size. I am not please with the size of it.,Neutral
It’s tiny but super well made,Neutral
Pricey for no jar to come with it,Neutral
"It didn't give it a 5 because I have used it twice. Therefore, I am not sure of how study or will it is made until I have traveled with it. The color is as pictured, it was packaged well. But it doesn't smell like leather, or how 100% leather used to smell.",Neutral
"How do I describe this scent?  Obsession for men by Calvin Klein cologne.  Obsession is described as a woodsy scent, I was hoping for a more masculine earthy scent (lavender can be all grandma-ish at least for me), so maybe what you're looking for exactly, but I was surprised how much it resembled the cologne rather than the earthy scent I was hoping for.",Neutral
"This review is not about the quality of the item. They are beautiful and true to color. This is about value for money. Not worth it. They are very small and not the stationary I was looking for. I wanted a large page not a card. But like I said before, they are beautiful.",Neutral
It’s okay nothing much to rave about,Neutral
"I bought the extra small tag & it is perfectly sized for my 8lb, average, long haired cat. It came beautifully packaged, no damage. They included a ring to attach to collar + 3 small rings/clips to attach tag to ring. Sorry that's so convoluted but idk the right terms for the ""rings"". The 1 star is for the difficulty reading the tag. The font is exactly what I ordered. The print is exactly what I requested. However, maybe because I ordered the shiny silver, I can't read the tag unless the lighting is perfect & I angle the tag just right. It was a miracle I got a pic that at least shows some of the words. Plus, Freya is camera shy... Or just likes to be difficult. I wish the lettering was in black on the shiny silver. That would have helped. We have many feral cats in my small town which are caught, taken to a vet, spayed or neutered, tagged & then released. Freya doesn't need all that hassle so if someone does capture her, I want them to know she's already mine. I requested that the bottom wording say ""Amy's - In/Outdoor. Perfectly done, but, as said above, difficult to read.<br />1 star for easy to read, 4 star for craftsmanship (minus 1 star only because the lack of color for words) & 5 star for lightweight.",Neutral

"[[VIDEOID:dfcc56f0ca10edf48df8cae611f2abc]] The latching mechanism for the two earrings were very problematic with each one having the opposite issue.  One earring was so loose it wouldn’t lock shut and would likely fall out throughout the course of a day.  The other was so tight we couldn’t get it unlatched.  I had to get tools to bend the mechanism open and even after that it was still very tight.  I used a pair of pliers to tighten up the loose one, and it will now latch though still not sure how secure it will be.<br /><br />The earrings are beautiful and look great.  If you can get the latching problems resolved these would be a very good pair of earrings.",Neutral
"The quality is fine, however, I wish I had paid more attention to the fact that the grey color is so light and that so much of the pale wood background shows.",Neutral
"Cute, but size up! I purchased an Adult women's shirt and it was a little snug, but still cute because you like a lady cut to be more form fitting. The kids shirt definitely was small. I would size up, even for kiddos. My little guys shirt fit more like a 7-8. Other people in our group also experienced the same. Shirt quality was okay and bright colors, but the other set we purchased from another vendor was much better!",Neutral

They did say it was a ""flat"" stamp but they also showed a picture of it beautifully stamped on an egg.  I tried everything and no way did I get more than part of the stamp on an egg.  The egg would have to be huge (like an ostrich egg, lol).  The stamp is cute and works well on paper or on an egg carton, so there are uses for it.",Neutral
couldn't use it----the first letter was missing a piece.,Neutral
This is the second time I bought this and the first time I wore it for 2 years and it was awesome! It didn’t tarnish at all. I only replaced it because one of the small balls was loose. The second one I got in September and it’s already tarnished.  I’m pretty bummed out about it. On another note if you’re having issues with smell this cuts that out. Overall I love it but I wish the quality was consistent.,Neutral
"The product itself is awesome. Your directions are just a paper template. I used a laser guide to cut the template out perfect and the tray didnt fit. So then i had to keep cutting millimeter by millimeter with a jigsaw until it fit. I had all foam under my deck and didnt know where the drain hose should go. Tried calling 3 different times for suggestions and no one ever answered. Was working on it right then, needed help then not whenever they wanted to get back to me so i never left a voicemail. Called over a 30 minute period. Took me 4 hours to get it in but it sure does help my back and is a great product, just the directions/support suck.",Neutral
"These are really cute online but in person was disappointing. They looked faded, and not glittery. Ask for glossy print ahead of time. If they do it, it Would look so much better",Neutral
Super cute. Low quality chain that rusts in a week. My daughter wears this daily. She loves it. But even slight sweat or moisture from her hair has the chain rusting. We will keep the charm and replace the chain.,Neutral
"Very beautiful photos, nice quality prints, just a bit challenging to find frames for. I actually had to hand cut along the borders to make them a bit smaller so they could fit in a frame. Didn't like having to do that.",Neutral
The quality of the cup isn't all that great but it will do.,Neutral
"Love the ring, but it's 3 sizes too big and I got the same size I always wear. Great quality but sizing is off",Neutral
The website picture shows the name very clearly.  But in reality that was not the case in my case.  Letters were not very clear.  Although I appreciate the time & effort this took I would not recommend this to others.,Neutral
"Its a beautiful necklace in a beautiful box, but the charm is significantly smaller than I thought it would be. In the product picture it looks bigger than what it actually is.",Neutral
I did not look into dimensions. Was smaller than I had pictured in my head. Yet it is still quaint and accurate to description regarding wood and white font. I'm happy with it,Neutral
"Two things, not as detailed as shown in picture.  Looked like the coin was  worn down considerably.  The other thing is it's slightly beveled like a cone. Other than that it's a good ring.",Neutral
Don't wear with a collar or scarf around your neck. I lost one earring the first time I wore them. Luckily I lost it in my house. Next time I wear them I'll use a rubber back. Very light weight & nice looking.,Neutral
"looks pretty, but way too big for my wrist.",Neutral
Shelf was not very well made. Some of the corners were off by about a half inch. Nails were sticking out in a couple areas that I had to remove. I think if a little more time and attention to detail was made it would be a nice shelf.,Neutral
"They were a little larger than I envisioned. Not the artist's fault, just my ability to judge. The colour is very nice and overall I was pleased until I put them on. They came apart the very first time I wore them. When I went to remove them the glass separated from the back. So they are useless to me.",Neutral
"Product is good quality, but the personalization was incorrect. I paid for two personalization and only one was done - that's $15 down the drain.",Neutral
I bought the ring for my mid finger. It’s adjustable for us with larger fingers. Quite thin and the hammered effect is not as prominent as I would like. I wear it but I’ve bought inexpensive silver that is better quality.,Neutral
Literally just card stock laser printed photos of this art work. They didnt even bother to trim off the white. Really makes me wonder if its the original artist or if someone stole it from another artist. The thank you note for ordering it is on higher quality paper than the actual prints.,Neutral
"A lot smaller than what I expected-but that’s on me for not reading the product details.  They did the job, the idea of them are good, but I took them out of the package and first thing that happened was one of the earring hooks came right off the tassel. Luckily I was able to hook it back in but it happened a couple more times before I even had the chance to wear them. The best part about these earrings is they are very light. Other than that the quality is not there.",Neutral

All around beautiful piece. Functional and aesthetic. The cord on one was damaged. There was a sizable nick on the resin of the other.,Neutral
Cute but very small doesn't fit and I have a small nose,Neutral
"Prettier and more vibrant in person. My complaints are that it didnt come with its own screws or hanging bits and it looks like the fabric (vinyl?) canvas was stapled on the wood a little sloppily. The images could have been scaled down a bit to include all aspects so on the sides you will see a lot of overlap. That may have been the intention but there seems to be unnecessary amount of space on the bottom left. Despite these issues, it really is a nice print overall and a good size.",Neutral
Not truly black. They are a black brown.,Neutral
The magnet is not very strong and falls off the fabric very easily. Graphic is cute though.,Neutral
In person this bracelet is very skinny which I'm not so happy about the one's like these in store or churches were there much thicker which is what I expected.On the other hand the durability is nicely strong and it looks just like picture.,Neutral
It is put together wrong,Neutral
Disappointed.<br /> I could of designed it myself in such a way and have printed it on photo paper at home. When I read “art print” I don’t think photo paper. I’ll keep it as sentimemt but it is not what I wanted.,Neutral

"The sticker looks nice and stays on well, and the design is clever. It is smaller than expected and expensive for what it is though. 9 bucks for 4 stamp sized stickers (especially if you only have 1 airpod case to use it on) is a bit high.<br /><br />I could've probably snipped the design picture and get a custom sticker print for a fraction of the price, but I bought these originals anyways to support the seller.",Neutral
"Smaller than expected. Could not use for intended purposes. Quality was o.k., just too tiny.",Neutral
"I gave it 3 stars because the picture shows it mounted on a wood and the description stated its mounted with screws.  The metal item itself is beautiful but it's not mounted on anything so now I have to send it back or find a piece of wood, cut, stain, finish and mount the item myself. A lot more work than I planned for that's why I orderd it handmade so someone can do that for me. I love the peice but it's not complete.  Had the description stated that and wanted to do additional work then I may have given it a better review.",Neutral

"I got this product to prevent scratches on the switch screen which it did do. Unfortunately for this product, screen protectors are its biggest rival since it can do the exact same thing in preventing screen scratches.

"While it is a pretty ring and I like the idea of recycling, repurposing, etc., I was disappointed in the ring.  The band is narrower and the stone smaller than the photos implied.  Should have cost less than I paid.",Neutral
It looks pretty good after I put it on but was very hard to put on. I bought two other Tweety Deca's and they were about easier to put on.,Neutral

This is a good product but could use more stability to it. With the bottles on it it wants to lean. I'm sure it would be great for plastic bottles but mine are glass.,Neutral
They are super cute but of the 100 pieces (50 in each pack) only 20 of them are airplanes (10 in each pack).,Neutral
"A lot smaller than I thought it would be. Wasn’t hard to apply. No issues with it coming off yet, its been about a month.",Neutral
The ornament is cute but smaller then I expected and it was delivered with a scratch on the back of it.,Neutral
"Cute, and great packaging but a sort of a racket - there is a simple metal ring (~$1), a piece of leather, a screw and an anchor all separate pieces you put together (simply and easily) and drill into wall. The price is a little much compared to what you are getting. Kudos on the good marketing tho!",Neutral
Nice a little flimsy need to be careful putting up,Neutral
There are much better and bigger spa sets that are worth the price listed. This was a smaller than expected set. Nothing extraordinary to result in the price listed. I wouldn’t have even thought this was worth half the price it is selling for. Everything was miniature. Disappointing,Neutral
Thought the workmanship would have been higher quality.,Neutral
"The mandala itself is beautiful, however, the bale of the pendant is small and thin even though it appears larger and thicker on the photos. You will only be able to wear it on a thin chain with a small clasp ring. I had to change the ring to a larger one in order to wear on a weightier chain or cord. I was going to buy a nice bale to put on pendant in place of ring, but the hole is the size of a pencil point. I would have given 5 stars if it had a decent size bale instead of the poorly thought out design.",Neutral
"Product is nice, if you’re looking for something at a nice big size this isn’t it. There aren’t any hooks or really much areas to attach a hook.",Neutral
"Faint aroma, I had to add essential oils.",Neutral
Looks like the picture great quality...not as big as I thought it would be though....,Neutral
"The high notes are ambiguous, lemony citrus with something else I don't particularly like. Underneath is where there is a very light pleasant musk which remained after I tried to wash it off, but it smells more like a feminine musk if I had to choose. I don't think citrus and musk go together very well. Maybe a friend will like it.",Neutral
"It was beautiful, but it’s very fragile and weak!",Neutral
"I liked that these were made in the USA.  If I can find products with that label, I buy them.  But as to the design and fit of the mask, I have to say that the one that I bought from Rite Aid made in the place that makes everything actually fits better.  So I was a bit disappointed.",Neutral
"Sticker looks great but didnt transfer the numbers, i tried multiple times with no luck.",Neutral
Great bag. Fast delivery. Embroidery looks great. The ribbon color does not match the embroidery at all.,Neutral
"pretty and well made, but not as red as i thought it would be",Neutral
"I like this picture online. When I got it, I felt there were not enough butterflies or they were not as big as it seem in the picture. It's a big white board with a few butterflies flying across it.  Butterflies don't look as good as well.",Neutral
I neglected to read that it is a photo copy.  The affirmation is excellent.,Neutral
"I know they listed the dimensions, but it was smaller than expected and just doesn't look right.",Neutral
These are really cute but the posts are too thick and were hard to put in and hurt my ears when I tried them on. I compared to the posts of other earrings and they are probably triple the thickness of my other earrings. It’s too bad because otherwise they are very cute.,Neutral
"I had bought my husband one for his birthday and it was larger than most and very beautiful.  We both love it, so I wanted one for my bureau.  It came one day sooner than I expected, which was wonderful. But I was very disappointed upon opening it, as it was not as big as the first one. Nor was the quality as good. I would have gladly paid the extra $5 for the larger size.",Neutral
"I like the quality of the hoop, but the edges are a little sharp so it hurt to push through. Even though I twisted it the right way to insert so it didn't lose its round shape... It still lost its round shape. It's like an oval in my nose so if it twists around it looks weird. I'm going to keep it and wear it, but I wish I got a 6mm so it fit more snugly against my nose. I measured my old 18g ring that stuck out a little and it was more like 8mm, so I got the 7mm thinking it would fit snugly and I didn't wanna risk a 6 in case it was too tight. I also wish I got a 22g instead of a 20g because this seems a little thicker than I expected! But now I know. Hope this helps!",Neutral
Pretty but small.,Neutral
TOO SMALL...WASN'T EXPECTING SUCH A HORRIBLY SMALL SIZE,Neutral
The colors are not the same. Pretty necklace. Probably paid too much.,Neutral
"I love the idea, but the lettering is hard to read.  The best description I can give you is the the letters are kind of smeared.",Neutral
It turn black in a month,Neutral
"$20 for this?!  So cute, but the price is high even for Amazon's DIY competitors.  Plus, the certificate is... underdeveloped.  Otherwise, it's a lovely idea.",Neutral
"Hot straight from the source, not the Amazon page, and it does in fact come as advertised, however the black stuff rubs off with wear, and the chain blackens kinda quickly. All that said, it is still a nice necklace I wear daily, and I surprisingly get complements on it and a lot of people want to know what it is. Either way, I wear it for me and it serves its purpose.",Neutral
"It seems to be a nice product, it is a disappointment that it is not a page from the dictory that gives the definitions of ""home""",Neutral
"Well, they fit, but not really well (I wear a 6 - USA). The plush looks inexpensive, and the soles are incredibly hard. The heat-able insoles work alright, but I wanted to wear them while sitting on top of my bed, and have warm, snuggly feet. But the soles are just so freakin' hard! I hadn't intended to wear them outside at all, but it appears that the manufacturer had other ideas.",Neutral
"They are a hot mask. And I was under the impression that they would stand away from my face. They do not. In winter they would be fine, but sweat inducing on a warm day<br />They do fit well",Neutral
"PROs:<br />- Nice grain to the wood<br />- Good as a decorative piece<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Spoon portion doesn't hold much volume for serving purposes<br /><br />Overall, it's a beautiful spoon that is limited in practical use.",Neutral
"I really like the style and weight of these earrings, the only issue I had with them was they are bigger than I expected so the bottom of the x ends up hanging over my ear lobe. I was hoping for them to end at the bottom of it. This was the only issue I had with them. They are pretty and dainty as advertized.",Neutral
It’s a good product for its price. The custom part is smaller then I thought and the custom writing is hard to read but it still looks nice,Neutral
Italy was broken<br />Parts of Russia border was not trimmed correctly and couldn’t connect with other piece.<br />Blue part came broken too,Neutral
"I have been giving each of my sons a new, unique and relevant Christmas ornament for over 25 years. While this serves the purpose, at $15+ each it is waaaaaaaay overpriced. It is machine cut out of a soft wood with some spray paint splashed on. The ribbon is a piece of beige yarn. Sadly disappointed.",Neutral
"I bought it for my sister-in-law for Christmas, I really like the design of it. She liked it too! But the chain looks cheap for what I paid for it. Hopefully it's not a cheap chain and it doesn't break!",Neutral
"Pretty,  will give as gift",Neutral
"I was excited to receive these glasses. They are somewhat cute, but in my humble opinion, the online pictures are far lovelier than the actual product. The colors are much brighter online than in person. I will keep them, but I can't say that I would recommend them to anyone else.",Neutral
"I would not give this as a gift, it's not made very durable or good quality. I think it's plastic.",Neutral
It was smaller than said dimensions,Neutral
The holder broke immediately and cant be trust to hold.the customize writing came out nicely.and the see trough case is ok,Neutral
Product arrived bent. Was way more of an oval then a hoop. Looks funky on because she was not correct,Neutral
My daughter loved them. She wore them all the time but they broke & cannot close. Gotta order another pair.,Neutral
"I love this pin, but one of the posts snapped off the first day I wore it.",Neutral
Much smaller than expected. Posts are soft. Post wrinkled acordian-style on 1st wear.,Neutral
"Love the quote, but I didn't see that it was just an 8×10 picture.  My mistake there.",Neutral
The only complaint I have about this product is that it is VERY hard to latch. The chain loops are very small which makes it difficult to hook,Neutral
"My son requested I buy this for him, and he really likes it, except for the $100 charm. He's bummed it's not the $10 bill, since that's the bill Hamilton appears on. It is also very delicate, so be aware of that.",Neutral
I expected a little more quality,Neutral
Ear rings are nice but mainly aqua and pink.,Neutral
"While the print on the shirts is perfect, the shirts themselves are very thin and not likely to last more than a few washes. We had to order from a different company.",Neutral
Tiny imprint but adorable piece all together for a baby.,Neutral
Color of “birth stone” is too pale and it is not easy to adjust bracelet size for my 5 year old granddaughter.,Neutral
Unable to wear due to the product running 2-3 sizes smaller than expected.  Quality construction and material though.,Neutral
"It was ok, not what I expected. Alittle cheap looking, but you get what you pay for.",Neutral
Nice just bigger than expected,Neutral
Small,Neutral
"This is a great banner. I couldn't get this anywhere else. The only problem I have with this is the low quality picture they used and enlarged it. You can see the pixels on the edges of the picture and it is fuzzy. The lettering seems fine, but looks like a word creation with a copy and paste picture from the internet without AI adjustment to enlarge it or a high quality picture to prevent picture degradation when over-sized. Appreciate the fast shipping though. Thank you.",Neutral
"Overall I was contempt with the product, however there were some aspects of it that was a little off. Some of the pictures were very out of place and random that I did not think followed the theme the product was trying to portray.",Neutral
These are nice earrings but they are quite small.  I was not prepared for the size--maybe I did not read well.,Neutral
"The hook needs a stopper to keep it from coming off, especially in these times when we're having to take on and off face masks.  Otherwise, the stone is very pretty and matched my mother's necklace and bracelet.",Neutral
"These earrings are very pretty on, very light weight and I lived them for the 15 minutes I had them. I put them on when I got them, sat down and watched tv for a couple of hours, and when I got up, one had worked it’s way off and was lost. And that’s with me just sitting! I would reorder, because I loved the earrings, but decided not to because off it fell out of my ear when I was just sitting, I’m convinced the same thing would keep happening. It’s unfortunate they don’t stay in place because they look great on.",Neutral
"Too rustic for my taste. Pretty but it was rough,  nails were showing and I had to sand it down to prevent splinters. I still kept them because the design is very pretty.",Neutral
Small. Like really small.,Neutral
"I was under the impression I was receiving a set of rings, had I known I was only receiving one I wouldn’t have purchased",Neutral
"I really really wanted to like this item. It was packaged well, but it is so flimsy that even with great packaging it came broken in three places. I was refunded my money, I was just very dissapointed because I wanted something a little sturdier",Neutral
"I'm sure many people will enjoy it. For my purposes, there's wasted space and the organization should be changed: Any necessary 'meal prep' and 'notes,' shown on the front side, should be permanently placed with your recipes for future reference instead of repetitively on the then current week's menu list. The backside blocks for grocery lists would be better associated if formatted like the front side menus in full horizontal boxes just like on the front side; and, divided in three columns - breakfast, lunch & dinner. I will use these as it's nice seeing graphics instead of the usual, formal Arial (etc) font.",Neutral
"These rings are tiny, like made for a child's hand definitely not adult size. Ridiculous for the price, hand crafted means imperfections...I returned mine and at least they gave me no problems with that except I had to pay the return postage.",Neutral
Just a little too wide,Neutral
Very thin,Neutral
Of course gold is bendable which I'm thankful for. But my toes can't handle it. One it's a little too tight even after bending. But I think getting used to a toe ring in winter is not the smartest idea. Will wait until flip flop weather to try again.,Neutral
Its basically a cheap plastic with a string. Got it for my daughter. It served the purpose and thats about it.,Neutral
In the photo it appears to be framed or in a black matte and it isn't at all.,Neutral
They are double the size I expected.  I have not worn them because of this,Neutral
It’s pretty and I love the way the text looks. The wood is also a really pretty color and grain. I did notice some issues on the edges. Some nicks and wood that needs to be sanded down. I was also a little bummed that it didn’t come with the hardware to hang it up. But I know we can fix those things ourselves here. Little disappointed but pretty overall.,Neutral
It was alright for a girls room nothing special,Neutral
Me pareció demasiado delgado el material,Neutral
"This is a great ring, but it was too little so make sure that you go size up from your size because it seems to me it runs small in size",Neutral
"I bought this as a baby present for one of my best friend's new baby. I live in Ca. she lives in Texas.  My Friend assures me that she loves it. But I was disappointed when she sent me a picture.  The quilt she received doesn't have as many daisies as the sample shown on the site's picture. Note: I paid extra for the daisies to be added. So, I guess I would recommend the Quilt (?) but Don't pay extra for the daisies.",Neutral
"i love the earrings, however they make my ears break out and hurt.  cheap metal is what i believe is the culprit - which ive been allergic to my whole life, but i figured take a chance.  they are super cute though i just wish they didn't make my ears get infected or hurt after wearing.",Neutral
The disks don't hang across where you can see all 3 they lay on top of each other. If I had known this I wouldn't have purchased.,Neutral
"Beautiful bracelet! Engraving, size and color were perfect, BUT it turned my infants wrist green pretty quickly. We put it up as a keepsake, but I wish she could wear it!",Neutral
"The color of these is great.  They are cute and a good size, but they seem a little thin to me.  They come across as a little flimsy because the metal that makes up the back and what goes into your ear bends and flexes pretty easily.  The decorative part does not, though.  I will definitely wear them.  The style is simple so they can be worn for many occasions, but I do wonder how long the gold will last or if they will tarnish soon.",Neutral
If I bought again I would get it in tan which suits its casual style more than the red.,Neutral
The website picture shows the name very clearly.  But in reality that was not the case in my case.  Letters were not very clear.  Although I appreciate the time & effort this took I would not recommend this to others.,Neutral
Nice design but very small.,Neutral
Pretty fake looking. But okay for gag,Neutral
Much smaller than I anticipated but well made,Neutral
These are super cute. I got for my top piercings I found the. Super hard to put in because of the little flat part that hooks into other end to keep in place. Once I finally got one in. Owwwww I was unable to clasp it shut. Maybe someone else will have better luck. I haven’t tried it in my non cartilage piercing yet.,Neutral
I would have preferred that the word “loyalty” is spelled correctly. My dog didn’t notice but I did.,Neutral
"It’s okay. The size is good, and so is the engraving. Easy to bend. Came tarnished, would have expected to be polished. Payed jeweler to polish it. I guess that the difference between something average and great.... small detail.",Neutral
Beautiful decals and easy to apply. Only reason I gave this less stars is due to the seller. I’ve ordered several and have had shipping problems each time. And the shipping on this item is kinda high since it says fast shipping. They ship the decal only after you email them,Neutral
"I loved it when I put  it on,I wore it for a few days and it broke.",Neutral
costly needs grapevine wreath or something else for the price. nice size,Neutral
Would have liked a bit more aroma of gardinia.,Neutral
"For one thing, I never make comments… but the earrings are not what they appear to be in the images posted. The earrings are plastic. Some of the images make the earrings appear as metal shaped into earrings; while others reflect the plastic nature and etching. These are not metal or hypoallergenic based earrings. Only the part through the ear is hypoallergenic. I am not happy with the product. I’m disappointed in the deceiving pictures. Very disappointed. Please note that it’s etched plastic of the image and doesn’t even face the right way when out in.",Neutral
"may i just say, I am &#34;very disappointed&#34; with this print.  The color of the print i received is not accurate to what is represented on amazon...the colors of the print on amazon are more vivid, more rich; as for what i received, i could have easily bought a greeting card, and mounted it myself.  Never-the-less, i stuck it in a frame, put it on the wall, and there it will remain.",Neutral
"The picture is great, I love it. However, it was folded twice to ship, so you can see the two lines going down the picture. It also got a bit crushed on its way here, so there are also wrinkles. Not really complaining since the picture is great, just a little disappointed.",Neutral
I wanted this engraved for my daughter for Christmas but I couldn’t get a hold of the jeweler that sold these,Neutral
"When you look at the pictures, I thought they were matted, not cardboard paper. I didn't realize I would have to turn around and go buy frames to put them on the nursery wall, which was another expense.",Neutral
"While the smell is fantastic and exactly how real patchouli is supposed to be, it doesn't last at all.  Please make it longer-lasting!",Neutral
I think it’s over priced.,Neutral
"The front part where the watch is , is super cute.  The back part where it connects is super bulky and just isn’t what I expected.  I wish it would maybe snap together and be less bulky on my wrist.",Neutral
"I could not wear the product. And when I did try to wear it, I could not breathe. The product is shown to be large. However, when you receive the actual product, it's small.",Neutral
"Scratches easily, really bendable, which is good for many different sizes of wrists, but the problem is it's hard to bend back to the same shape",Neutral
sad that it broke so easily,Neutral
Size and # for carets,Neutral
"This suncatcher is well made, but the packaging smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I will not buy again from this seller because of the odor. It is really cute though!",Neutral
They are very yellow gold and will start to fade in color quickly. But they’re super cheap so what do you expect.,Neutral
"I recieved this necklace shortly after ordering it and instantly loved it. It's super cute and the engraving that I paid extra for if perfect. The only disappointment is that after a only just a few wears, it seems like the silver is already tarnishing and I will need to figure out a way to clean it to renew it to its original condition.",Neutral
"This necklace would be beautiful if the charm wasn't removable! It's attached to the chain with a clasp that is usually used to fasten necklaces behind your neck. That part is usually hidden and not meant to be seen. But this necklace draws your attention right to it because it's right at the focal point - the charm! I'm going to have to open up one of the gold links to take that clasp part off, and then close the link back up around the chain so that it will look better. I think the clasp being right at the charm cheapens the look of the whole necklace. If it wasn't attached like that, it would be perfect, because the pearl with the shell on it is really cute!",Neutral
Is what it says.,Neutral
"Has a nice fragrance, just doesn’t last very long.",Neutral
"Very very cute idea but you can tell everything is cheaply made, chain is really bumpy and feels like it would break any second, gemstones feel like plastic, but it’s a nice thought.",Neutral
While the decal is just what I ordered the layout is strangely spaced. Don't love it.,Neutral
"Yo pedí tamaño 18"" pensando que sería del tamaño del ancho de la cuna y no fue así.<br />El alto de las letras es 4"".<br /><br />Para no botarlo lo usamos para colocarlo en la puerta y se ve bien.<br />Recomiendo comprar arriba de 54"" si buscan colocarlo como letrero en la pared.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought & for the price its thin 😕,Neutral
Too small.  Size is not accurate at all,Neutral
"I bought this like three years ago, to do a at home foot soaks for my now fiancé (who needs relief for her foot time to time). It gets the job done completely, because I was looking for a copper (non-plastic) foot basin. Without thinking I forgot I wanted to add epsom salt, and sometimes essential oils to the water. Since it may make the copper corrode faster, we place a plastic bag over it when we want to use epsom salt or essential oils in the water.",Neutral
"The stones are good size but if you have big wrists, it’ll be a bit tight. Take a some time to get use to the pressure on my wrist.",Neutral
"Super cute! Material states sterling silver but it feels cheap, thin, VERY bendy! Not the most comfortable, little scratchy like a bubble gum machine ring. Guess we will see how it holds up!",Neutral
I was surprised at how small they were for size  medium to fit a 20 inch pot..very small !  But the cobalt blue is very attractive .,Neutral
just before I get to use it the atomizer breaks in my hand. so I grab and old bottle with the atomizer and thats what Im use it now. I works good on the hair.,Neutral
It's cute but a little too clunky for me.  I have small fingers so it didn't look right.  Since I have my kids names on it and the price was reasonable I'm keeping and will wear it,Neutral
 ,Neutral
It’s okay.. kind of to big for the nose. Tried bending it a little to make it tighter and it deformed it.,Neutral
The blanket was a good size and very soft. But the lettering looked really cheap. Looks like the letters were just glued on. Hard to wash.,Neutral
"So very tiny! There aren’t a lot of items to honor a fur Mom on Mother’s Day, so for that I’ve rated 3, plus shipping pretty quick, but this item is TINY!! Not worth the price, I would not order again.",Neutral
I thought the print would be on thicker nicer paper. It seems pretty flimsy to me. The color of the ink was fine and I'm sure it will look great in a frame. I just thought the quality of paper would have been a lot better for the price of $11.95.<br />I probably won’t buy from this company again. I feel like I could have printed this myself. Too expensive for the price. It should be $4.99 not $11.95,Neutral
Muy sencillo,Neutral
"Wish it weren’t super light, almost tin. Shows fingerprints",Neutral
"I love the actual image / artwork, but it’s highly overpriced for what you receive. The frame is NOT included, in fact it doesn’t come in ANY sort of frame/display, just an Office Depot sheet protector. (The weathered wood-like frame shown, I purchased on Amazon separately for about $14)...<br /> It’s Cute, but I could’ve achieved the same thing with an old dictionary and a $3 stamp from any craft store.",Neutral
It's tiny. It was a gift.,Neutral
"Though this is a very cute and festive ornament, it is extremely expensive for what you get .. a paper cutout.  I should have read the description closer, I just didn’t realize that it is less stout than cardboard paper.  Shipping was another almost $6 so for $18 I got a paper cutout.  Not sure its worth my time to return this, but I certainly would not buy it again at this price.  Short of using it as part of the wrapping for a gift, I would be embarrassed to actually gift this to someone.  I would not buy again at this price...",Neutral
"Such a good sign for a One year old photoshoot. It was in perfect condition when it came in. Package was outstanding and very well packaged to assure of no damage - If yours ever come in damaged most likely it was the Delivery Driver being careless. The only downfall is that it will not stand on its own, most likely because the sign is not bulky / thick which gives it an elegant look but wont allow it to stand on its own. I believe product is overpriced but I could not find any other One sign that looked elegant so it was worth it. Sign is very pretty.",Neutral
Butterfly is still very pretty but does not appear as in ad. Right side is very small/bent wing.,Neutral
"This is a cute clock and very well made.  I was disappointed, however, that the clock color in the picture is not the color I received.  I wanted this lovely dark gold with what looks like an orange tail, but my clock is very light yellow with an almost light green tail.  The clock hands are much larger and block the cat's eyes.",Neutral
"Nice design, but very difficult to actually produce a cookie from dough because the intricate design picks up the dough and won't let go.",Neutral
"They are no so magnetic. I mean, it is difficult to put in the metallics doors, they go down.",Neutral
They are cute but waaay bigger than I thought they would be,Neutral
I bought to put smell in my car. Put in a bag with the little pillow things. All I got was an oily mess. No….,Neutral
this pic was soooo small.  I knew the measurements but just expected more for the price.  I could have printed something like that on my own for free,Neutral
"the Garnets were not as red as I would like but very pretty. the earrings in total were more appropriate for a younger, smaller woman. I like them bigger, longer more present. May give them to my granddaughter.",Neutral
The wood is thinner and lighter than expected. Also the base and letters have an awful smell which makes me concerned about any chemicals that might have been used. Little ones do tend to put toys in their mouth. The added engraving on the back is very nice.,Neutral
"Solo le doy 3 estrellas porque vino doblado, tratamos de arreglarlo pero fue imposible. Aparte de eso el letreto es súper cute",Neutral
The items were great- the cross and 2 bars with it.  My son loved his name and birthdate on it.  The chain was cheep and tarnished within the first week of him wearing it.,Neutral
Just smaller than expected.,Neutral
"Lack of detail identifying the 911 Carerra culture to include 1984-1989 models.<br /><br />+ = quick shipping  __  = lack of genre for 911 Carerra, - ""gold faux parchment"", illustrations cheesy.",Neutral

"Really cute, but waaayyyy too expensive!!!",Neutral
Love the prints but I only received 5 instead of 6 prints.,Neutral
way smaller than I expected.,Neutral
This is a cute piece but not for $30 it is chunks of hopefully crystals melted into plastic. The picture looks like something you could wear with a nice upscale outfit but once you get it you realize this is more of a plastic beach or fun day out necklace that you wear because if it gets broke or lost it is no big deal. I like it but like I said over priced to be a big piece of plastic around your neck.,Neutral
It’s was smaller than I expected,Neutral
Not as pretty as picture and larger than I expected. They reshipped a better pair but still a disappointment. Wish it looked as nice as the ones in pic. Gave 1st pair away.  There is no true purple turquoise sp I'm not sure what stones Re.,Neutral
"It's basically a JPEG picture printed from a computer printer. The quality of the paper is good and colors are vibrant, just expected more I guess. It looks cute in a frame. My daughter likes it.",Neutral
"Pros: Packaging, size, longevity of scent<br />Cons: Texture is dry and powdery compared to other wax melts I have used. Scent is not natural at all. Smell reminds me of an old lady’s perfume.<br /><br />I was pleased with the quality and delivery of the product and would try other scents from this company. Just stay away from this one. It doesn’t smell like oranges or cloves...",Neutral
Nice print,Neutral
"The phone/iPod case are both nice but I lost the top less than a week after receiving it, as it comes off easily.  Product was not received on the promised date didn’t come until a week later.  If you need it for a gift order at least 3 weeks in advance.",Neutral
This is a nice silicone mold . The only con for me was the depth were not the same on both cactus. They do not come out the same thickness when you make earrings.. Overall I liked it tho..ive made many sets so far.,Neutral
Product was perfect.  Did not fit and requested exchange.  Company never responded.,Neutral
"This is a beautiful needleminder. But, it barely holds the needle. The needle does, however,  hold wonderfully to the backside of the minder. Not sure if the problem is that the magnets are backwards, or if the minder itself is too thick for the magnet to reach through, but it does render this minder less useful than many of my others.",Neutral
The color is beautiful but I was totally disappointed that only after one day one of my nails already chipped and I even put on a base and top coat.  This nail polish is too pricey to chip only after one day ugh!,Neutral
Great looking chain broke after second time I wore it.,Neutral
The collar is pretty and looks cute on my dog. I am concerned how long it will hold up. The fabric doesn’t seem as good as others I’ve had.,Neutral
Funny but cheaply made.,Neutral
I liked being able to personalize. The wood was thinner than I thought it would be. The item came in a good box for presenting.,Neutral
A beautiful piece for your stove top! But BEWARE! The potential for fire is great!  Someone accidentally turned the stovetop on by bumping into it.  It took several hours of us trying to figure out where the smell was coming from until we found it.  A tragedy averted!!,Neutral
"Cute but costly for less quality. Got Brass. For a gift.....,,",Neutral
Cheap for the price,Neutral
A paper sticker. Doesn’t fit bottles that aren't perfectly cylindrical without wrinkling. Served its purpose.,Neutral
I bought this for a particular dress that was baggy in the back. It doesn’t stay clipped. May be just the dress material.,Neutral
This was too big for the arm it was purchased for,Neutral
I was expecting a larger bracelet,Neutral
I was really excited about these earrings. Size was great. The color was much darker and not as shiny. It was more chalky then as shown in the picture. Wouldn’t purchase again.,Neutral
"Its amusing, but low quality. very sticky so mouse does not slide well. but its amusing so I will be keeping it. just not ordering anything else from the company.",Neutral
Overpriced,Neutral
"I want to give this 5 stars! Still waiting for a reply. I've tried through Amazon a few times to contact the seller. The item is exactly what we wanted. Even had a friend order 3 after mine!!! I just need a size smaller, the stones stay unger my finger and won't stay right side up. I don't want a refund, just to exchange. Gorgeous product, just waiting on help.",Neutral
"To start off the print quality is very poor. I understand it on canvas but the picture quality is just bad. It's like look at a 1980 tv on a tube television. The delivery time was also excessive in my option, especially since they charge for shipping. When i finally received my package it was damaged upon opening the box... was very mad. The out side of package had no damage so this means it was put into the box with the damage preexisting. In any case i contacted the seller and they replaced it quickly but the second print was even poorer quality.. i guess the saying goes you get what you pay for. in this case garbage.",Neutral
It was a lot smaller than I expected.,Neutral
"Look as shown. Didn’t hold nearly as well as other brands I have used, though.",Neutral
Beautiful stone. Size was much smaller than expected.,Neutral
Thought it was a wood plaque but it is just a piece of paper.,Neutral
They are very cute but the post are very small lost the one earring with an hour of wearing them,Neutral
"Material was too thick, it was hard to bred.",Neutral
Loved the glass but inscription was not attractive. I thought it would’ve be nicely scripted but blocky and not attractive. Giving 3 stars due to this.,Neutral
The stones are quite small there is no shine to them. I don’t agree this ring is worth the price I paid for it. It is a lovely design though. I like that you can adjust the size as sometimes in hot weather fingers tend to swell so its quite comfortable especially to stack.,Neutral
The extra ring fit properly but the ordered ring is not a 7. This ring is too big.,Neutral
Super cute. I bought one for each dog. My teacup got the smallest size and it's the perfect size for her.  My only complaint is that the engraving is super light on both of them and is kinda hard to read. Even on the larger one I purchased.  Good value for the money though.,Neutral
This is nice and works well.,Neutral
I love the hand sanitizer holder! It is so cute.  But it is pictured as coming with the chsp stick holder too and that I  didn't get.,Neutral
Cute but really small,Neutral
Got this for a birthday present and she loves it. It was a little on the cheap side material wise. Also one of the names wasn't lined up very well.,Neutral
I was expecting this to be stretched canvas on wood that I could hang. Also couldn't. Color this in at all with sharpies. It was packaged nice but that's about it.,Neutral
faded fast,Neutral
Beautiful. But it is so thin and light weight. Feels like it would easily break if worn.,Neutral
"The image is gorgeous. It was packaged safely and not damaged. However, this is NOT a push pin map as advertised. It is on photo paper. If I pushed pins into it, I would actually be pushing them into my wall. I had to purchase a $70 poster frame that I plan to use without the plastic front so there’s some kind of backing to push the pins into. I could not find cork board as large as my map since i ordered a larger size. The listing says there will be stickers included if it was not mounted, I received no stickers. It also took almost 6 weeks to receive. I’m kind of bummed bc it ended up costing me more than double what I was expecting bc of the cost of frames this size.",Neutral
I was looking for the blue tigers eye but this is so dark it’s almost black and I don’t see the blue at all,Neutral
I've ordered this one before and it had an amazing smell but this batch had no smell.,Neutral
"Very small compared to the picture.  Looks like a miniature version of them.  Still exactly as pictured, just skrunken.  Don't feel like they are worth the price.",Neutral
"We had no issues with sticking to the cabin door.<br />The only problem I had is that the “J” in my name does not look like a J. It looks like an i that is too long or a J that is missing the hook. I contacted the company and was told that it is the style of font used. Other than that, they are super fun and cute for cruising.<br />Made finding our room easy to find! Lol",Neutral
I thought it was tin. I guess I should've read closer,Neutral
"Actually very pretty, but I can't use it....way too small.",Neutral
"These are really cute but can't wear them for long before my ears reacted (about 18 hrs). I'm not very sensitive to metals so it's unusual for me to have a problem. If you are sensitive, you might not like these.",Neutral
Lettering wasn't clear,Neutral
"They are cute. However, you can tell right away that they are homemade. The ""Bride"" part is just a sticker. Definitely not a flip flop to wear for a long period.",Neutral
"The bag itself is really nice, however the color &#34;gold&#34; is vey much yellow. There is nothing gold about it. So as nice of a bag as it is, my now has a cheer bag with a rival school's colors.",Neutral
"Aren’t as shiny as picture, and much smaller in person",Neutral
"Print not centered on text, so looked a tad off in the frame, wasn't terrible though. The ad picture online is not off-centered. so my copy just wasn't as good.",Neutral
Works well,Neutral
"I made the mistake of not reading the full description and assumed this came with the matted frame.  It's cute, but def. not worth the price for just the stenciled paper.",Neutral
I bought this for a particular dress that was baggy in the back. It doesn’t stay clipped. May be just the dress material.,Neutral
"This is a favorite John Muir quote (""He said the sun shines...""). However, Right/Left & Top/Bottom margins are WAY off, which I just discovered in attempting to place the five 11 x14 prints I ordered to place in 5-pack of 12 x 16 frames I ordered, which came with 2 sizes of mats to accommodate either 8 x 10"" OR or 11 x 14"" print. Now must go to frame shop and have mats cut down, or buy new custom cut mats. About the paper, I thought it would be parchment, but it's a photo of parchment on thin glossy paper. Could flow with paper quality, but it's just the fact that Lone Star Art Store in Texas didn't take the time to center type before printing, which is baffling and disappointing. I would have bought simple 11 x 14"" frames without mats if I had known beforehand that margins would be so uneven. It's a smart and innovative business idea though, printing famous quotes and selling them. Took photo, but can't get it to upload...",Neutral
It is a decent product.  It doesn't really work well for me.  The place where I put my hand is too thick.  I can't get a good grip.<br />I guess I could do a little whittling around that area to thin it out so my grip it tight.,Neutral
"very upset. not what I expected, and I thought I would be a regular customer",Neutral
"I thought this necklace was very pretty but for the price I was expecting a higher quality chain.<br />The connections at the clasp and the stones are cute, and the stones were pretty.  If it had been cheaper OR a bit higher quality for the listed price I would for sure call it a keeper.",Neutral
Kinda cheesy for the price,Neutral
High price for what I received but then I remember I wanted the message to display. Disappointed but ok because of message.,Neutral
Honestly just wasn’t impressed with the quality.,Neutral
"I made the mistake of getting just my son's 4 letter name engraved, which proved to be too small for the length of the plate. It's also kind of dark and hard to read. Otherwise so far so good, durable, hasn't broken or anything, isn't flimsy.",Neutral
I ordered this a while ago and it came in exactly how I wasn’t expecting one of the clasps broke off the chain and still haven’t had the time to go fix it,Neutral
"The frame is low quality and smaller than expected but the butterfly’s are nice.  This really is a $12 item, not worth the $40 that I paid, oh well, live a learn.",Neutral
I like this but thought I would get information about the names of the knots!!,Neutral
Just a little too wide,Neutral
All was good till I noticed from the package the sticker part on the “s” was messed up ... still looks good decent material just wish the “s” wasnt jacked lol,Neutral
"These are cute, and we were surprised that we received all 6 of the prints, but the print is cheap and you can see the printer lines all throughout the images. Not a big deal if you are far away, but would have been upset if I paid more.",Neutral
Very cute tag. Only 3 stars. Just too heavy for my little poodle,Neutral
I expected the pearls to be a little larger.,Neutral
Had it for 4 months. Accidentally hit my hand and it broke. Not to happy about that,Neutral
Small yet beautiful. It rusts in the rain.,Neutral
La cortina es muy corta me ubiese  gustado la presentación de títeres de pie,Neutral
got 2 for my girls who are in gymnatics as a suprise. both came on time and looked fine my 9 yr old only got to use hers once and on her way to gymnasytics the bottom of her s was leaking. not sure if it was just a default but she was really upset. git should have made it more than one day. everything in her bag was soaked. i would love a replacment bc she really loved it.,Neutral
Very pretty but the pendant was attached to a cheap fixture that was supposed to hang on a cord. The fixture should have been closed. It kept falling off the cord and eventually the fixture ripped right off the pendant.,Neutral
"So…..this product comes with absolutely no directions!  I wasn’t sure whether this was a leave in conditioner or a rinse out.  I ended up trying both ways and it ends up better on my very fine, thin, frizzy and wavy hair as a light rinse out.  I try to do right as I’m finishing, and then just one light rinse out with a squeeze dry.  I let my hair air dry with this in and it rolls into soft waves with a lot less frizz than normal.  I was not a big fan of the scent - it was too medicinal for me.<br /><br />I probably will not order again.",Neutral
"Cute design, but I’m doubting the inks are premium as they look more subdued (less pigmented) and a bit pixelated in real life, at least the ones I received. Plus, several of my stickers on one sheet look like black ink from another print job smeared on them... very unpolished looking. See uploaded image for detail. Item also arrived later than expected and when I’d sent an inquiry to the seller, I never did receive a response. So customer service appears to be lacking as well.",Neutral
the reflective eyes don't shine well enough,Neutral
Dislike,Neutral
Pretty item; however very lightweight and  not very sturdy; metal bends very easy,Neutral
Very small and dainty,Neutral
"I initially used this product for knee pain... It was great the first time I ordered it. It was smooth and it just rolled on my knees without any problems. The second time I purchased it, it was pretty grainy and kind of dried up... it was a little disappointing to say the least.",Neutral
"It is a pretty piece of jewelry and beautifully made, but unfortunately too large for my wrist so I gave it away.",Neutral
"The bracelet is nice , but I’m not feeling the necklace because it has no energy and feels like it has a coating on it, which is weird..<br /><br />The bracelet is lightweight and feels comfortable on your wrist.<br /><br />I was mainly interested in the bracelet, I will probably end up giving the necklace to someone else.<br /><br />I don’t usually wear gemstones unless I feel good energy from them. With this I felt nothing..<br /><br />It comes in a pull out style gift box , and would make a great gift for someone who needs protection from negative energy..",Neutral
Very pretty and love the gems but leaf work very fragile.,Neutral
I’m happy with the embroidery but I was hoping for a bag that had some padding at least but it’s just an expensive tot bag. That’s just my opinion.,Neutral
"While being well made, as soon as I started walking with them on they started falling off. Repeatedly. after the 6th time I gave up and took them back inside. Highly disappointed.",Neutral
Picture was pretty along with tassel and anchor charm. I was disappointed that the lighthouse name or information on it was not included on the reverse side. No identifying info whatsoever anywhere.,Neutral
"I love the picture, i was thinking it would be on a canvas type of paper or something more than a glossy printer paper copy 8.5x11. It’s overpriced for what it is. I do love the message and the photo, but $13 is steep for something like this. Its just something I could've made and printed for significantly less. If it came with a frame of sorts that would've felt more realistic for pricing. Yes I knew it didn't come framed, I just saw the high reviews and grabbed it. Wish it was larger and on a more professional printed paper than the Fuji film photo paper.<br />However it does earn a few stars for the photo itself and the artwork. It is something I stumbled over and it was good timing. Ill have it framed and hung. I just wish it wasnt as expensive as it is.",Neutral
"Really like the look of this bracelet, but the tension holder, or whatever you call it, doesn’t stay for long. When it loosens the beads swing down, putting the tensioner on top of my wrist. I guess it would be better if the bracket tensioner was heavier, or there was an ornate clasp of some kind.",Neutral
It was entirely too small,Neutral
Mold smell in cord. Sorry I ordered through Amazon. Never an issue before when I ordered direct from Jill. Always well made quality.,Neutral
"This is a nice necklace, but it's heavy. I've worn it a few times but due to it's size and weight I usually opt for other jewerly. It's a beautiful piece though.",Neutral
The flowers are very pretty but they do not stick to the wall.  I need to find some adhesive to pit them back up,Neutral
"They're nice enough, but nothing to rave about.",Neutral
Me encantaron pero se cayeron ambas caras de la estampita en la pulsera. :(,Neutral
Much smaller than expected but cute,Neutral
If I had time to shop I could have found something better quality for the same price or less. I purchased this for my wedding and it was ok. The material felt cheap and the packaging was not pretty. I wouldn’t give this as a gift again. It’s more of a prop item for decoration maybe.,Neutral
"Loved it, cleared the entire house of chest congestion.",Neutral
I didn’t read and ASSUMED these were framed. Ugh.,Neutral
The smell does not last. Very disappointed in this purchase.,Neutral
These worked to soak up grease but I think a regular towel would work just as fine.  Nothing special about this product,Neutral
"Disappointed that it is not an actual dictionary page, why would someone want a regular photograph?? It's supposed to be unique...but it's not. It is a clear picture and the quality is good for a photo but I could've done this myself instead of paying $12. Not what I was looking for, but it's my own fault for not reading the reviews and misunderstanding what it actually was. I would have never bought it for a gift bc there isn't anything special about it.",Neutral
It looked like it was made w love but it chipped pretty easily and quickly after wearing it in the shower for about a week. That made it unwearable because it bothered my skin. Def made w love. Kinda light in weight. The rope that it hangs from seems resiliant.,Neutral
"The pendant itself was beautiful, but the chain looks very cheap. After buying a new chain, my mother loves it and it looks really pretty!",Neutral
"I like the idea of the ring. The stone sticks really far out off your hand so be careful with hitting it on everything throughout the day. Mine was just poorly made, although I'm sure that isnt the case with them all I can see them being very popular. It would be cool to be able to choose your stones because I wouldn't mind mine and my husbands stone instead of my birthstone and a cz. Maybe secure the pins that hold the ring on better. Mine could have just fallen out but I didnt wear it after I noticed that within the first hour of having it. Great ring though.",Neutral
Smaller than expected,Neutral
It was too small and thin couldn’t fit my nose. But they gave me a easy return,Neutral
"While this is crafted well, , for the price I expected way more opal to shine through.  It looks like a quartz necklace more then anything which makes me sad. To me not worth the price paid",Neutral
"The photos are beautiful of course, but they're not Satanic.",Neutral
I expected the gnomes to be centered so that I could trifold the hand towel (which is typical). Instead the gnome picture is on the bottom right so there’s no way to hang and display it without the rough edge of the towel being visible. It’s not a classy hemmed edge either.,Neutral
Was a little disappointed that there was not more detail on the jar. This item is really overpriced,Neutral
They did not stay in place as in the photo. The heavier front has a tendency to skip to the bottom.,Neutral
"I was expecting more for the money I spent. I only use it to hold my mailbox key, but it's very thin leather and the rivet and key ring are very cheap. Doesn't feel solid at all. For this price I think I overpaid",Neutral
"The product itself was satisfactory. It's a little soft but it may be the fact that it's organic (which is not a huge deal). I just felt a little duped by the picture. With shipping I paid over $8 for a single tube of chapstick - I really thought I was getting more than one. I can't rationalize the price tbh. So while the chapstick itself was ok, I can't see myself buying this again.",Neutral
It was just smaller than I anticipated.,Neutral
"I like this pendant for stacking. It is very nicely designed, and crafted. Reasonably priced. But the chain was inferior. Strong, but easily tangled, so it had to be replaced.One thing though calling this piece large is totally misleading. Compared to what?",Neutral
Ordering options wasn't clear and I didn't receive the version pictured or I thought I paid for. It's nice but a bit misleading.,Neutral
"Quality of photo is just as advertised. Colors are bright and font is clear. Item came faster than expected. However, it’s on normal card stock and for the price I expected something of higher quality and sturdier.",Neutral
"applying this was a nightmare. Wouldn't buy again, but it looks cute.",Neutral
Beautiful leather journal. Looks very close to the picture. I only rated 3 stars because i believe the leather could have been more sewed tightly to the paper in the journal.,Neutral
I got a 2 xl and it is tight. I usually have room to spare in 2x seeing I ware an xtra lg normally,Neutral
It’s okay but not exactly what I expected,Neutral
They're on a glossy photo paper which makes them look much less vintage.,Neutral
Love the earrings except when I went to put them on one of the posts broke off the chain. Very bummed.,Neutral
ok,Neutral
"The ring is beautiful and well crafted but I have the earrings and matching pendant and bought the ring to complete the set, but it doesn't quite match. The ring is a darker green enamel and there's a teal blue enamel circle in the middle instead of a stone like the other pieces. I still wear it since it's not noticable in unless you look at the set side by side, but I'm very picky so it bothers me a little.",Neutral
The last one came in a box!,Neutral
Bought this for my brother and he likes it however it didn't arrive on as promised,Neutral
Love that it's hand made.  Charm came off had to be put back on,Neutral
"I was really hopeful that this decal would be great because of the good reviews. I have purchased a few other decals from others and they were all great so again I thought I would have no problem whatsoever. Wrong. Even after following the instructions to a T, it still seems to be bubbly which doesn't look good at all on both the big letter as well as the family name. I am highly disappointed.",Neutral
"Th design of this paper is beautiful, however it looks and feels like it was printed on copy paper.  Each piece could wrap a small gift.  I thought it was a bit pricey and I was disappointed in the weight of the paper.",Neutral
"For $12, I was expecting a better quality. It's smaller than it looks in the picture and very tin material. I know it's a tea towel, but it's still really thin and small. My kiddos got dirt on it and it did not wash out at all. I was disappointed.",Neutral
"It’s cute, but for just a card it took a bit (on prime) to get here. But after it made it on time, was worth it as the birthday kid is a swiftie…",Neutral
Beware that these are extremely tiny. I ended up giving them away to a 13-year-old girl because they were just too small.,Neutral
"I love wearing my gold filled necklaces. I have others from Amazon, different brand,  that do not fade to dark, this one sadly is darkening. However, if you’re wearing it on its own, probably better, I ordered it representing each one of my 5 kids, so there are five letters and it holds up great! Sits perfect and comfortably on my neck and does layer with other pieces.",Neutral
"I'm going to have to spend some time detoxifying this, totally covered in dryer sheet smell.",Neutral
"Very pretty earring, but very difficult to get in and out. It's comfortable to sleep in, but I get in a sauna daily and the heat makes it too hot, so I have to remove daily.  It's very hard to bend and line up so it looks closed.  If you can just leave it in it is pretty, but not practical for changing often.",Neutral
Turns skin green.,Neutral
To thick to use as a drinking straw and cold on my sensitive teeth,Neutral
"Loved this product, but couldn't use it because it was meant for the outside of the door. The glass on my door has ridges on it and I would not be able to apply it properly. But all in all it was made well and is a great design. Wish they would make one for the inside of a glass door viewing it from the outside.",Neutral
"Great quality but....there are certain formations of days you cannot make! The specific number of days we needed wasn’t a possible combination due to lack of correct numbers on the blocks. So we had to add a day. If you can live with that, then yes, they’re very nice.",Neutral
"It is a beautiful bracelet, but after a couple weeks it turned my wrist green.",Neutral
The bracelet is beautiful and presentation is as well. The only reason I didn’t give five stars is due to the misleading advertisement. The picture in the ad as well as the picture that tries to get you to combine with another item for a special deal shows a group of three bracelets so I was expecting three and was surprised to get only one. I mentioned this to the seller who said she would change the verbiage to clarify but I don’t see that change. Just know you are only getting ONE bracelet and if you’re good with that I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with the quality.,Neutral
The packaging is very flimsy.  The metal sign is sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard and that’s it.  Small bends in the metal makes it look warped.  They really should rethink how they mail out the product esp for the price paid.  Looks beautiful but how it arrived is disappointing.,Neutral
I thought this was a sign - my error,Neutral
"Nice necklace, solid and sturdy. Comes with the light to make it glow.",Neutral
Not impressed with the imprint,Neutral
"Beautiful ring, but it is huge. Got it for my 19 year old daughter.  Just looks to big on her finger.",Neutral
"I purchased these to wear one in a cartilage ear piercing. They were never comfortable. I believe it’s because of the way the hoop ends fit together. Regardless, they just did not work for me.",Neutral
That the size is different and different fonts. I did not ask for it like that !,Neutral
I liked it at first but the more I look at it the ring looks like it was made from a badly worn coin if it were made from a newer coin maybe  relief not up to par for the price.,Neutral
"TLDR: $5 for 1 sheet of 36 stickers<br /><br />3 stars because they'll arrived ahead of the estimated timeframe and are a good quality, look like the advertised photos.<br /><br />But HONESTLY, I feel SO DUMB for spending $5 on a SINGLE sheet of 36 (not ""approx. 54"" like it states) stickers from a seller with zero reviews and without having read the description better. I saw ""approx. 54 stickers"" and was like ""oh that will be perfect.",Neutral
fits the remote great but would be better if it was wider to fit the remote with the cover on it.,Neutral
"I love the bracelet, but like others have stated, it doesn't stay hooked, so it keeps falling off.  I wore it twice, and it's lost.  Glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it.",Neutral
Will not let me enter my initials on select page.,Neutral
The bracelet is very tight and feels like it may break if stretched over my wrist.,Neutral
"So sweet and dainty.  I loved that the length was adjustable but it was difficult to hook together into one very small hole.  But, my biggest complaint is that after wearing it for a couple weeks or so the sterling in the front faded/discolored and would not clean up with sterling cleaner.  It is almost like the sterling wore off and left cheap steal.  Disappointed and time had lapsed so that I was not able to return it.",Neutral
okay,Neutral
"Great packaging, great ingredients but just did not work for me. Worse it is making my natural, undyed, untouched, dark ashy brown eyebrows turn blonder and red. I only try one new thing for my face or body at a time, and this was the first thing I have tried for my eyebrows. I don’t  use eyebrow makeup or gel or anything, so this was the only thing that could be changing my eyebrow color. It may just be me, but I wanted to put it out there in case anyone else had similar issues.",Neutral
It is pretty on my wrist new look with watch but I am getting itchy whenever I put on my wrist. It is because of the edge of the knot the was heated and pressed flat.,Neutral
"Was ok, stick to Duke Cannons THICK viscosity bodywash with scents of tobacco, cedarwood and leather. That will last longer ,you get more for the price and the scent is MAGNIFICENT and LONG LASTING.",Neutral
I have mixed feelings about these earrings. I liked them till I wore them. Not my style but they are pretty in their own way. Seeing it in person though it just looks like colorful warts on my ears with the texture. To say the least I’m giving them to my cousin now. Pretty purple but not my style.,Neutral
"From the pictures I was expecting these to look more like a polished disc. They look more like the post of an earring that you can DIY and attach something to the front of. I still wear them occasionally, comfortable and good small size.",Neutral
This bracelet is vety petite and the customized name printed is not defined. It is too fine and barely readable.,Neutral
"I was so excited when I ordered my noodle board. The seller was responsive and designed my board with a rooster design.  When the board arrived I found that the workmanship was less than good. The handles are loose and cannot be tightened. They are loose enough that I am afraid to use them to pick the board up. It is also obvious that the seller put the handles on incorrectly and replaced them, leaving holes that he fixed with putty. That would be okay if it wasn’t so obvious. The attached pictures show the repaired holes and how they look on the board. There are also holes on the back of the board that were made when the seller put the handles in the wrong spot. They were left unfilled and it looks unfinished and cheap. The board itself is made with three pieces of wood that do not lay flat making It difficult to put anything on it. I contacted the seller to see if there this could be remedied but I got no response. I recommend you use another vendor if you want a noodle board. The quality and service are lacking here.",Neutral
Cute saying - but the towel was low quality,Neutral
"The ring itself is well made, but keep in mind the stone will not look the same as the photo. With that said, I was still a little disappointed with the way the stone looked vs. how it is represented. I knew I wouldn't get what was shown in the photo, but the opal is more of an opaque/milky white and you really have to work with it in light to see the slight iridescent qualities and even then, it doesn't shine, or look beautiful. There is some smokey grey mixed in, too, which I don't love. It my choice to take a chance on this without seeing it in person, so I'll keep it, but I don't think I'll take a chance on opals without seeing the exact piece I will be getting. I think the seller/maker meant well, but some stones are just going to look better than others. Maybe i'll try something other than opal from this seller, because I do think other stones are more forgiving in their differences.",Neutral
Had it for 4 months. Accidentally hit my hand and it broke. Not to happy about that,Neutral
"As it’s super cute, it’s disappointing due to the fact that it’s made out of paper. Very flimsy and floppy. Very creative and I love it but I really thought this was made out of particle board. That way I could’ve kept it for a keep sake.",Neutral
I thought it was going to be a little more to it,Neutral
I love it! However you better have alot of patient's peeling it off and sticking it to your wall.,Neutral
"I turned off after 4 hrs and 15 of using, not because the wax was gone...had to give my head some fresh air. The scent REALLY takes getting use to. I only used 1 cube. I would NOT buy this scent again, not that it is bad, just not what I was thinking in the description of aromas, which I liked...but can't smell anything close. Not bad, takes some getting use to, but next time I will pass on this one.<br /><br />UPDATE:  i could NOT get use to the scent..it made my head feel very stuffy, so I am returning it. Will NOT buy this scent again.",Neutral
Very sparkly but extremely little . Should be advertised as children's earrings,Neutral
Very Cute,Neutral
I was expecting a different font. The ordering process did not provide enough information on its appearance but the unit keeps liquids cold or hot and does not leak easily. It is a quality unit.,Neutral
It was ok.,Neutral
"This is a good beer mug, my boyfriend loves it. The only thing is I thought the decal was engraved on and not essentially a sticker.",Neutral
"I loved the earrings...just one disappointment.  The earrings did not come with backings, and I was eager to wear them.  Unfortunately, I lost an earring the very first time I wore them.  Word of caution to buyers...put backings on first!",Neutral
I thought it would be more like a banner but it was basically a poster.,Neutral
"It's a nice poster but the bottom is cut off from the image shown,the dimensions are correct,but image is not.My frame is 24x36.<br />I know the poster size is 24x32.",Neutral
"I bought the amethyst purple ones to go with a deep purple bridesmaid dress specifically because the description said the color was very dense, but these are a very pale purple. I'll keep them because they are cute, but the color is way lighter than what is pictured.",Neutral
"It is ok, but it is so thin.",Neutral
"Print is nice, but the trim could have been better. If I dont look at the stamp each time its used to press on the enjoy by line, it doesn't print correctly.",Neutral
"It came in box filled with packing peanuts so right out of the gate it was a mess just trying to get it out of box. The smell of clear coat was really strong as the box was opened. The organizer was actually wrapped inside of a 13 gal white trash bag. So I was afraid of what what I was going to find once I got it free of the peanuts, trash bag and box.  But I was pleasantly surprised. Everything looked good. As it is definitely a handmade product I tried not nit pic little things. But when you pay $150 for something that is supposed to hold paper plates and plastic silverware I figured I could be a little picky. The burlap ribbon was glued on a tad bit crooked. I can’t pull it off and realign it.  I wish the compartments were larger. I host up to 45 people on average for cookouts and get togethers and it simply isn’t big enough to hold the tray style Styrofoam plates. But it is big enough for the regular paper plates. But not big enough to hold bowls. Now, in all fairness the dimensions were provided by the seller, so that is my fault for not paying attention. But the compartments for the forks, spoons, knives were absolutely perfect! Heads up, I left the organizer Out in the garage for 3 days and you could still smell the clear coat. So if you’re  needing this for an event make sure you buy ahead ahead of time so it has time to cure. It’s sturdy and very well put together. I feel this organizer will last a lifetime. The handles on the sides made it easy to move it around. And they felt very securely attached. I will give this product 5 stars if they fix the packing issue and clear coat smell.",Neutral
They were ok. Nothing special.,Neutral
The band height is very thin-not what I expected. Should have read the description more carefully!,Neutral
KIND OF HARD TO BREATH IN FIT IS GOOD,Neutral
Really cute but way over priced for what it is.,Neutral
Color is amazing only downside is that it is not a gel polish it's a regular nail polish and takes hours to fully dry and even then it's already peeled back amd doesmt look all that great,Neutral
"Be careful when ordering....size is true but more important, fresh off the home printer. Not worth the price.",Neutral
"I was disappointed. This is basically a one by five piece of wood.  Some sanding but not much. The top was perfectly flat but the bottom is bowed so it doesn’t sit firmly on my counter. It rocks. In addition there is a knot on the bottom that protrudes, making stability even worse.. It could’ve been sanded flat but it wasn’t. The paint is rustic. The stenciling on it is even more rustic. No matte sealer was applied.",Neutral
"I can’t fully review this item, I purchased the incorrect size. The 15.7 inch chain is so small for like a child’s neck. It fit very tight, if I turned my head it might pop off. I would have liked the width to be larger as well. I tried to return and get the larger size but the shipping fee to return will cost more than what I paid for the necklace. It would be nice for them to have a sizing chart so ppl don’t have to guess. The free gift and note is a nice touch which is why I gave it 3 stars.",Neutral
Can hardly see the dandelion seed.,Neutral
Wasn’t worth the money in my opinion. Smaller than what I had thought. Buy your own bow.,Neutral
"Really small.  More for child size.  I lost one immediately as it is so small, its hard to keep on.",Neutral
It was to large for his wallet,Neutral
Some of the other reviews had said the birthstone falls off and I should’ve listened. The key was nice but I had to mess with it to try and get the stones to stay on the key ring. I tightened them but I’m still thinking they might fall off over time.,Neutral
Gift for granddaughter.  Just received her driving license.  Just as it looks liked it but don’t know how durable it will be,Neutral
They only send 1 key chain EVEN though it is for a COuples 2nd Anniversary....what are they supposed to do take turns...NOW i am forced to purchase a 2nd one ......I have bought many a Anniversary gifts in the past I haVE ALWAYS RECIEVED 2 ITEMS SO THAT EACH PERSON hUSBAND AND wiFE CAN HAVE A ITEM CELEBRATING THEIR ANNIVERSARY<br />tHE KEY CHAIN IS NICE AND SMALL.....HOWEVER for 20 bucks there should have been 2 in the package,Neutral
Stinky but useful and comfortable. Okay after a few washes.,Neutral
"These were OK, probably not worth the price. But they are pretty",Neutral
I dont think it makes a good  facial cream,Neutral
"The neck is really large, but it was pretty.",Neutral
It's a thinner metal than I expected. But pretty.,Neutral
"It will look good on our daughters wall, I’m not 100% happy with the way the “I” is but it will work. It has VERY ROUGH edges and was hard to paint because of the numerous flaws. We used it, I was able to fix it but I wouldn’t order from here again.",Neutral
You can only use it one day,Neutral
They're fine. But they're so small that you need to bend them to get them into your ears and it's almost impossible to bend them back once in.,Neutral
I love the design. But I dislike how See-through the shirt is.,Neutral
"A lot smaller than pictured.  Blue color is not vibrant, it looks gray and flat",Neutral
"Really very cute, but very tiny letters. For the price they should be much larger.",Neutral
"Pro: Scent is not overpowering and lasts pretty long, but has a VERY fruity smell.<br />Con: Not a Masculine scent and definitely not gunpowder scented.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very feminine floral scent, this is your melt. I'll keep looking for a masculine scent.",Neutral
"I love it. The problem I have is that the decal was sticky after it was placed on the water bottle, and there was no way to get the stickiness. It was made with iridescent paper, but you really can't see it, since things keep adhering to the decal, when it comes in contact with clothes or anything fuzzy.",Neutral
I like the pose and the quote but I don’t think the quality of the print is as good as I was expecting. I was hoping the quality would have been as good as the Lauren Bacall print. Lauren’s picture looks like I took it with my camera. Humprey’s is not as clear,Neutral
Very nice.....until I tried ordering another piece....it took weeks to arrive!,Neutral
"Ok, so staring at this decal on my wall makes me feel like my efforts were not in vain, because it’s a lovely decal.<br />What’s not so lovely is the nerve wrecking time I had getting this thing up! First of all the piece is huge and comes tightly rolled up. It’s not multiple sheets that you layer until you get the finished product, so application is quite tedious.<br />I started from the top and worked my way down.<br />I initially struggled with air bubbles and what seemed to be a lack of bonding to my walk, but once I got to the leaves it began to stick and the bubbles weren’t as bad. But, I faced another problem- tearing. It tore in several areas as the decal refused to leave the backing in some areas and then while I was working the left, the white leaf was almost invisible on the backing and tore a bit because I failed to see it. Luckily the tears are hardly noticeable unless you really scrutinize the thing.<br />Would definitely recommend using a tool to apply this decal to make it easier to remove air bubbles as you go.<br /><br />I’m only giving this 3 stars because it was a pain to put up, and I felt like I struggled more than I should have had to. Otherwise, it’s a beautiful addition to the room and I do get compliments from everyone that sees it.",Neutral
"This item is pretty. The concept is practical. However, in practice it doesn't really curl or bind fully. A bit stubborn to bend. But, it does hold the hair. So, if that is your goal it works well.",Neutral
Crystals are much smaller than expected.  Can hardly tell what color bc of the small size.,Neutral
"It was a huge bar, and there was ground up pistachios in the soap, sort of exfoliating. But there was ZERO pistachio scent, which is the actual reason I ordered it. Works great in the kitchen because it doesn't fit down the drain when we drop it.",Neutral
Cute but cheaply made,Neutral
"The pictures were a bit misleading, it is very small. Even with the short name I thought it would be longer, I also clicked the rainbow option so very upset with the colors, I thought even placing a blue color would make more sense then red and Orange cause they look the same color. Very upset and I don’t think it’s worth the price..",Neutral
My daughter loved it and put it on immediately. Unfortunately the Cham came off and she lost it about an hour after she put it on.,Neutral
These weren’t the size I was hoping for entirely too small beautiful nonetheless,Neutral
"It's a very heartwarming gift but it can barely handcuff a rat, let alone your partner.",Neutral
"Love the stones, but can't wear because the metal makes my ears hurt.",Neutral
They are adorable but I have fat ear lobes and the clear back isn’t long enough to reach the back of the ear,Neutral
I love the bottles. Some of the stars are coming off! But other than that cute,Neutral
"It was a nice crystal,but polished too much.It would have been better in its natural form.",Neutral
Very thin and flimsy,Neutral
It's true you get what you pay for. As far as the design/artistic I give it a five star. Unfortunately the material is flimsy and I don't think the artwork will survive a year of daily weather abuse. It's such a shame.,Neutral
The round bottoms part of the earring is pretty but the super cheap upper part ruins it and makes them seem low quality.,Neutral
Exactly what I excepted!,Neutral
Got this last minute and it did the job. It was a bit bulky and hot but loved it.,Neutral
Very pretty but the chainbroke,Neutral
A lot smaller then expected but that’s my fault for not reading the size measurements all the way,Neutral
As a mail carrier I recommend a box that locks! Theft is awful with boxes like there. Not throwing shame at this beautiful box or the manufacturer at all.,Neutral
I purchased two set of these beautiful coasters and have two left that aren’t broken. They are too thin and break easily. When I say easily - if the coasted sticks to the bottom of your glass and falls to the floor it breaks. They also warp if you have a sweaty beverage.<br />I sent the seller an email asking if they make a thicker version and told them the problem I was having. They never responded to my email<br />Or request. Love the way they look and was so disappointed when I found another one broken.,Neutral
"It is great, but a little heavy.",Neutral
"Very well built, and tape goes on off very easily.  The biggest problem I had was the tape wanted to fall off when I leaned over. I ended up using the clip part for another attached. Not reccomended for a tape measure.",Neutral
"I love the art on this card, why I purchased these - my lab is a huge part of our lives. I am disappointed in the quality. Looks like they were printed on a ink jet home printer, meaning the colors are flat and muted and the black has a green tint. Paper stock is ok.  Would not purchase again",Neutral
"I love this bookmark so much but unfortunately mine broke as soon as I opened it. One of the lega fell right off, sad because the idea gives me so much joy.",Neutral
Beautiful product just highly disappointed that it WAS NOT actually engraved instead it was just a sticker placed for the effect. Note for the business owner engraved means that its actually carved into the glass.,Neutral
"Writing is so small and almost smudged, can only see if I take a far away picture then zoom in . Other then that I like the size of the ring it’s self",Neutral
"It’s very cute and it’s made well,  but it’s annoying that it is printed off center.",Neutral
"I bought these to frame, i bought 4X6's and 5X7s.... except when I got them and tried to frame them, they were all about a CM bigger than 4X6 or 5X7 which was annoying because I have to get scissors and carefully try to trim off some excess on all four sides before I could put them into a frame, which took a long time since I bought 8 of them. Other than that, they look great.",Neutral
"These wooden animals are very small.  I thought they would be a little bigger.  The turtle was nice, but the dog's tail was broken.  The bull does not stand right.",Neutral
"I just received the tallow balm.  It shipped quickly and the price is awesome!  Upon opening the package i found the bubble wrap sleeve it was in saturated with the product as well as the outside of the jar - so apparently it leaked out the one day it was in transit.  Having used several tallow balm products from other companies, i immediately find this one to be much greasier than i prefer.  Sadly, i will be returning the product.",Neutral
"Please understand this is a photograph of artwork.  It is not an actual piece of art.  The colors are not bright, rather dull actually.  But, if you know what you are buying it shouldn’t be a surprise.",Neutral
"Enjoy the prints, however none of the specimens you have illustrated are dragonflies. Each image is that of a damselfly. Close, but no cigar.",Neutral
Just thought it would be more than poster paper. Like cardboard or plastic. A little more substantial. I guess I didn't read the fine print. Still getting hung up in a sewing room.,Neutral
Kinda small but nice,Neutral
They clearly didn't read the detailed instructions. But also  it's 50/50 my fault for not proofing. But other than them not following the noted detail I got to leave  the hat turned out well an seems to be great quality I will re order but this time I'm triple checking it,Neutral
"These are super cute but very hard to get in and out of my ears... To the point it hurts! Not sure if it's the matte finish on them, but I only wear niobium and don't seem to have that problem with any other earrings.<br />They are so painful to take in/out of my ears I doubt I'll wear them often. This is rather disappointing as I purchased the one in black, which is a staple to my wardrobe. ☹️",Neutral
The glass is heavy and awkward to hold.,Neutral
Was a nice piece of jewelry. Only issue is the birthstone was bigger then I thought. Still wearing it today.,Neutral
"I spray my house with pine scent during Christmas time. This was a great price compared to other products, but the scent is very mild. If you want a “light” scent, then this product is for you.",Neutral
A bit crooked on paper.,Neutral
Smaller than I thought it would be,Neutral
"Bought for my daughters sweet sixteen and the links of the chain came apart right out of the box. We were able to fix it and she wears it daily now, but a few moments of disappointment and “mom fail” at the beginning.",Neutral
Mine arrived damaged with creases.,Neutral
This smelled like hotel soap.  It did have a strong scent throw... if only I had found it pleasant.  It smelled not if sage nor lemongrass.  I threw them out.,Neutral
"I've had mine for over a year now, and it stains all of my notebooks with a oily sheen. I'd say the first four pages are useless. I'd love to know how to clean this off so it stops ruining my notebooks. If it wasn't for that I'd give it 5 stars.",Neutral
These are ok,Neutral
The wash is good but it irritates me,Neutral
Love the way this looks but the image quickly started peeling off.  Very disappointed.,Neutral
it is beautiful looking but there is a small opening no matter how much i try to close it. it irritated my piercing hole because it wouldn’t close all the way,Neutral
Face carving isn’t very clear. The chain is a choker which arrived tangled.. Wish I waited and bought a better cheaper one I found a couple days later.,Neutral
Too expensive for the quality and to hard to return.,Neutral
"Didn’t come with instructions, but the seller responded promptly when I asked him.<br />It was difficult to apply (straight and without air bubbles). The squares are individual pieces, it’s not all one sheet, and five of them didn’t transfer to the table when I first applied it, even using a straight edge (wallpaper) tool.",Neutral
The pictures themselves were pretty but the color was very dull as if someone printed those from a in-home printer cheap printer,Neutral
End product looks nice,Neutral
Challenging to breathe after wearing for over an hour.,Neutral
[[VIDEOID:f5d4d178d7c5473eb8728d1e941a9b8e]] Disappointed,Neutral
"This is very well made, but for my car the square shape did not work. There was to much leather in the way, so the key did not fit in the car. I bought a new one from them that is round and it is great. Both are super well made.",Neutral
"Looked bigger in picture, I brought for daughter, she is tall, These are VERY TINY. They are pretty color, but hard to see in ear.",Neutral
It's very pretty but has the flowers off set the largest flower is not in the center and that makes it offset. I know handmade has flaws and it is pretty.It was secured well on arrival but there is a crack where the small flower meets the band,Neutral
Very pretty ring. I wish I had gotten something different. I just think it looks cheap. But it's pretty.<br />Thank you,Neutral
Smaller than expected otherwise cute.,Neutral
Its still a cute hat but fasley advertized it as having a red ribbon to tie on. Instead it has a elastric string that loops under the chin. It looks uncomfortable to my baby and he keeps pulling it off. The ribbon would have been better. Ill have to attach a ribbon myself.,Neutral
In person this bracelet is very skinny which I'm not so happy about the one's like these in store or churches were there much thicker which is what I expected.On the other hand the durability is nicely strong and it looks just like picture.,Neutral
Love that it's hand made.  Charm came off had to be put back on,Neutral
"I loved the nose ring! I did end up ordering one that was to small, but got a response right away to replace it. But I’ve now had the new one for just a week and on the top that rest on my nose has turned blacked and now is turning my nose black.",Neutral
"It was so cute, but had an odd smell and was pretty dark.",Neutral
"I, too, fell victim to it just being a piece of cardstock.",Neutral
Not very durable. Not water resistant.,Neutral
"I loved these earrings. I miss them. Although being light and easy to wear is a great thing, it's also what made them fall out easily without me realizing it.",Neutral
"Kind of cheesy, you could print this yourself and frame it for way cheaper but the idea is cute.",Neutral
The scent is good if you’re standing right in front of it.,Neutral
The stones are very nice but both bracelets broke within 3 days of receiving,Neutral
Loved the glass but inscription was not attractive. I thought it would’ve be nicely scripted but blocky and not attractive. Giving 3 stars due to this.,Neutral
"It is cute, but I was thinking it’d be like a canvas, it’s basically printed on paper.",Neutral
Great way to track your water but only one sheet of stickers,Neutral
It was lighter weight than it looked in the photo. But a cute pendant.,Neutral
Nothing at all wrong with the shirt or it’s quality or how fast it was delivered but this item is not eligible for return and I decided to go with a different shirt for st Pat’s Day and more I can’t return.,Neutral
Smelled great but dissolved really fast and the scent went away pretty quickly.,Neutral
It is clunky.,Neutral
"Very pretty, wonderful quality.",Neutral
Nice little piece but I would rather it be sterling silver .,Neutral
I like the earrings but in the photo there alot larger and in reality there very small wish they was bigger,Neutral
"I bought these because I had lots of information to include on my dog's ID as she has three regular addresses she stays at. The three phone numbers are too small (in my opinion) to be easily read by a stranger who is trying to get your dog back to you. I am older, but would need a magnifying glass to read it.",Neutral
BeeYouTeaFull!,Neutral
"Great for about the first 1-2 weeks. Keep it in my pillowcase. For the price, it loses its scent quickly. Scent is mildy relaxing.",Neutral
Garfielda face is too big. I cant wear them.,Neutral
These earrings are really pretty but were much smaller than I thought they would be.  Also after wearing for just a couple days the metal started tarnishing and turning dark.  I'm a little disappointed because I wanted them to wear for everyday because they are so cute and casual.,Neutral
Difficult to put up,Neutral
Difficult to apply,Neutral
"It smells great, just didn't like swiping it under my underarms with my hand.  Then I had to wash my hands to put on makeup or clothes.  That just grossed me out.  It works ok.",Neutral
"Very cute, but if you have a small wrist it will not get tight enough and will be flopping around.",Neutral
"I like the look, but I cleaned the window and installed as directed and there is still a section of the sticker that wouldn't stick.",Neutral
Beautiful glass! My wife loves! Only issue is the bottom isnt 100% flat so it wobbles.,Neutral
"Disappointed that the seller would sell a PHOTO (fujifilm) of this cat picture for about $13.00 when I could have saved the picture myself and printed it for about $5.00<br /><br />Needless to say, it was my fault for not realizing the dimensions of the photo but had I known, I would have never purchased this.",Neutral
"Smells like the kind of oils you can buy at a head shop... an occasional whiff of it is pleasant, but largely it smells cheap and cloying.",Neutral
"It's ok, but was much tinier than I expected. I'm not a tiny woman but not huge either, and this was tight; hard to get ON my nose. Finally did, but wasnt comfortable at all. Never wore it.",Neutral
"When I found this as a tribute to my brother who passed recently, I thought it would be perfect for our truck. However I am disappointed with not only how long it took to arrive but the quality. My husband had to take some of the letters and wings off in pieces and stick them on the window because it did not peel off all at once. I have a feeling this will not hold up very long and I will be searching for something to replace it.",Neutral
"Supper cute, but too small and hard to get matches out.",Neutral
Not quite the same color as the pic,Neutral
"While I can appreciate that is is handmade it just doesn’t feel very quality to me.  It’s pretty stiff and doesn’t feel nice to to the touch.  If you need a simple, small, crossbody then you may like that.  I’m just not a fan.",Neutral
"Ordering was great, delivery was also great, what I was not happy with is that the chain the necklace came with was very sensitive and broke less than a week after I gave it as a gift..  not very happy!!!",Neutral
Cute design but not sure if it's for me... was also too small for my Littman Classic stethoscope. I was afraid it would damage the tubing.,Neutral
"THE BRACELET IS TO SMALL, NEEDS TO BE LARGER. OTHER THAN THAT OK.",Neutral
Well they put the wrong border on the lid and the metal the pan it made out of is very much on the thin side. But it's pretty,Neutral
"First off, this is not the correct order of the moon phases, but that is on me because I didn’t pay attention to that in the photos. I was just looking at the design. This item was packaged so nicely but unfortunately the item itself was cheaply put together. As seen in the photos, it is hot glued on the back. Also in the photos I show how the plastic is very bendy and not as hard as I thought it would be.",Neutral
It’s cute. The stone is big but  the name tag is barely readable.,Neutral
"I love the necklace, so very pretty, but the clasp is terrible. A small ring needs to be added to the chain as to make it easier to clasp. The only downside, cause it's a beautiful piece.",Neutral
My fault for not paying attention to fact frame not included.  Paper sign only is not worth the money.,Neutral
"These are really cute. But... some of them didn't stick real well to the party favor plastic bags. None came totally off, just peeled up some.",Neutral
Not what I was expecting. Very beautiful but kinda flimsy. Don't think it was worth the amount I paid but I do like it.,Neutral
Slip knot will not last,Neutral
Great,Neutral
"Construction is good, however my birds have stopped coming to the new feeder.  Feed trough is narrow and the<br />panels do not feed much seed.  After about 3 weeks I am replacing it with my old feeder.",Neutral
this is a photograph of a map.  Unfortunately it is not clear and so you can't read the details.  Was hoping for something to be able to study.,Neutral
"I like the wooden name a lot. But, it had flaws. First, i had to sand the edges of the name because the edges weren’t smooth & pieces of wood were sticking out. (like wood tearout)<br />Second, I paid extra for it to be painted white. It was painted nicely besides the back of the dot that goes on the “i”. It was dirty & not painted. I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good. Just disappointing when you pay that much money & the product has these issues with it that i had to take the time to fix / edit to make it right.",Neutral
The necklace is cute except for the birthstone. It is why too big for a cheap stone and looks awful.,Neutral
"Cheaply made, doesn’t open - your wrist must fit in the fully extended position to wear",Neutral
"I want to say first, I liked the bracelet, I love the company and the other items I ordered were necklaces which are over the top and will be perfect gifts.",Neutral
"I just received this and one the letters is not filled in with black. It’s engraved of course, but not as quality as I expected..will serve its purposed to identify my stethoscope, but I wouldn’t order again.",Neutral
This was a personalized metal sign and it arrived with one corner bent,Neutral
Looks cute. but very cheap material . Plan on getting a new chain.,Neutral
The bracelet is beautiful and presentation is as well. The only reason I didn’t give five stars is due to the misleading advertisement. The picture in the ad as well as the picture that tries to get you to combine with another item for a special deal shows a group of three bracelets so I was expecting three and was surprised to get only one. I mentioned this to the seller who said she would change the verbiage to clarify but I don’t see that change. Just know you are only getting ONE bracelet and if you’re good with that I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with the quality.,Neutral
The ring is beautiful and it’s also very comfortable but the reason why I gave it a 3 stars is because the ring is so smooth and shiny that you can see the scratches easily. On the 3 rd day I wore it I could already see small scratches on the top and I don’t remember how it got scratched.,Neutral
"I  purchased these birthstone aquamarine earrings for one granddaughter but unfortunately they were not available in peridot, so chose a similar style pair also made  by Jewelry by Dawn of peridot for the other granddaughter. When they arrived, each was in a separate little baggie however, both were stuffed into a tiny white box.  I felt it was tacky plus had to go out and purchase another tiny white box to put the other granddaughter's earrings in. I just felt it was poor service by the seller. Not the end of the world, but the girls get their presents at the same time and 10yr. old girls sure notice  when their presents are differing. I knew I could get ""away with different styles"" because they have different birthstones. I probably would never have thought about it if there were no tiny white box at all.",Neutral
"Not mounted, not framed, just a piece of paper.  Cute phrase, not impressed with the product.",Neutral
"Nice design, but paint quality is a bit underwhelming.  Also took a 5 days to make (ironic given the name).  Missing pieces (I dots).",Neutral
"So I bought 3 of these for my mom and 2 for me since they didn't look like plants that should stand alone. These plants are a bit weird. I guess I didn't understand what an ""air plant"" really was. I think a picture should be shown of the plant, with no roots, that come separate from the gold plant holder (that really looks like a napkin holder). You literally just push the plant into the holder. It looks cute right now, but the instructions on the card also say I have to feed the plant once a month with ""our Tilandsia food"" -- uh really? Then it's gunna die because I'm not buying some food to add to the water I have to spritz on the plant... Kinda funny the price went up a dollar since I bought the last 5 from the ""prior batch"".. definitely not worth the price, but I will mist my 2 plants 3-4 times per week and see how long they both last.",Neutral
This would have been cooler if it was on a page with the word lion<br />It’s just a random page. I thought it would be different.,Neutral
"The inside part of leather is rough,<br />The picture looks better then real product, the metal part made very cheep<br />Sorry that could not return it as supposed to give someone for a gift and had no time to get anything else",Neutral
Very pretty. Delicate. Difficult to put on. Have to bend them enough to get them on,Neutral
Really cute picture looks just like a postcard cut out though,Neutral
We ordered this sign fir my son who is a 3rd but they don’t give you options to place Roman numerals in the order. We ended up with his 3rd being 3 straight lines. We had to cut wood to add a top and bottom giving him Roman numeral 3.,Neutral
THey look nice enough - but not exactly as I expected.  They are more like a pillow CASE than a decorative sham.............,Neutral
"The resolution of the picture is not that great, however, the matting is very nice. I am sure my daughter will enjoy it!",Neutral
Back to big,Neutral
it is cute but the size of it is smaller than a dime,Neutral
This was so little and can be printed at home,Neutral
Smells good but scent disappeas after just a few hours,Neutral
"The bar is a bit wider than a quarter and not very long, a good thickness. I definitely recommend it! Not for continuous wearing, it'll turn your wrist green. It scratches easily and needs to painted in a clear coat it it fades after a week or so. Didn't get it wet, it just got worn out fast.",Neutral
"These are okay, but they are not as pictured. Please see my attached pictures. The earrings I received do not have the spiral shape and are not as substantial as as pictured in the ad. As a result they just look kind of limp. They just aren't as attractive as the pictures in the ad. They do appear to be silver.  They are a nice shiny silver color. They are lightweight, but very delicate so I would be very careful with these so they do not break.",Neutral
"These are wonderfully well made.<br />However, 3 of the 12 arrived broken.<br />This breakage did not happen during shipping; they were exceptionally well packed.<br />They were broken before shipping.<br />I would like to know how to request replacement of the broken pieces.",Neutral
its a nice sticker but the it doesn't stick to glass without you peeling it back a little and pushing it on by hand its a very good sticker tho nice color choices great quality,Neutral
"Small, simple easy to find on the collar.",Neutral
Would have been a great gift but it came with no name engraved on it. Was a gift so we just kept it,Neutral
"It looks great, but the sizing needs to be more obvious. $15 for A5 poster is insane",Neutral
This mask is so cute with the red ladybugs.  The reason for not giving  5 stars is because one side is more loose on my ears than the other.,Neutral
"I was so excited about this decal for my son’s room. I have purchased and applied at least a dozen different wall decals to my children’s rooms over the years with no issues, but this decal application was unbelievably difficult. The decals simply wouldn’t stick firmly to the wall, even after dozens of passes with credit cards and hands. So when we began to pull off the front layer, it was basically a nightmare with the decals detaching from the wall which resulted in stretching and ripping. With the help of two family members, we were able to painstakingly hold and maneuver and pat each decal into place, and while the far off results look good, if you get near the decals you can see many, many tiny rips and folds and wrinkles.",Neutral
"The weight and thinness were just what I was looking for, but Because these don't have a clasp and are very soft gold, they warp extremely easily. I bent them the diagonal way you're supposed to, to insert, and one of them still ended up slight warped so that about half the time, it doesn't lay parallel to the other nose ring and I have to twist it a little to get it to lay down right. Also, because they don't close completely, and because the ends aren't rounded, if the open end gets positioned inside the piercing itself, and you blow your nose, it really hurts. All in all, I wouldn't buy it again, but it doesn't bother me enough to return/get a refund. It's just annoying how few other closure options there are in this thinness/gauge. I would probably chose one with a rounded end next time around.",Neutral
I gave it to my boyfriend for a gift. Now we have recovered 5 beads… and can’t find the 15 beads….( I might have been able to get string and redo it)… but there is nothing I can do.,Neutral
eh...like the glass...perfect size.  The labeling started to fade and come off not long after I started using it.  Don't run it thru your dishwasher...hand wash it.,Neutral
"The print is only 11x14, not 21x14. Disappointed in the smaller size, but won't bother to return it.",Neutral
"Beautiful quality work, exactly the aesthetic I was looking for. However, the straps are not very comfortable without a layer or two of fabric underneath. Straps are also smaller than expected. However, they're still beautifully crafted and perfect for any costume's final touch.",Neutral
It was really cute! But smaller than I thought it was going to be but still really cute.,Neutral
A bit uncomfortable/ruff feel on eye brow. Wish it was softer on skin,Neutral
It was good until the clasp broke. Also engraving was sketchy,Neutral
"The quality of the bracelet is very good, but, it would have been perfect if the script was larger! The font is too small, so that was disappointing... I had seen another reviewer say the same thing, but, I would have thought that the problem would have been addressed.......",Neutral
Very strong!,Neutral
"These garden stakes are very well made.  Study and tough.  I bought 5 different ones and they are beautiful.  Two years later, a couple had the paint wear off and are rusty. They still look decent.  I would have bought a ton more if the finish been a better.",Neutral
"These are nice enough brings. They're smaller, thinner, and lighter than what I expected though.",Neutral
Pretty small,Neutral
Looks great and would be easy to put together if the screw holes actually lined up with the ones on the legs. I only have a screwdrivers and it was quite difficult. I couldn't even use two of the screws since they did not line up correctly. But it looks great and seems stable so I am overall pretty happy,Neutral
I am disappointed it doesn't have a hole or metal loop/clip on the back so I can hang it. There's nothing. It's also thinner than I thought it would be. The price is too high just to add paint. I think painting it should come with the purchase at a lower price at least.,Neutral
"A pretty ear cuff, however, it was to small to fit across the middle ear lobe as shown in the photo. I can only wear it on the upper lobe where the center design cannot be seen. Disappointed.",Neutral
"I just applied it to the wall. Not that hard to apply at all and it is easy to fix. Well packaged and the sample star was good to see if it would stick to the wall or not.<br />Looks a little busier than what I thought, but still looking good!<br />The only issue is that I ordered blue color to match with my wall&Tardis, but it looks like I got black color. Was unable to know until I peel off the paper. So kinda disappointing.",Neutral
"Cute bracelet, looks good but broke after 2 weeks of having.",Neutral
Very cute print and I love it for that but you need to iron it to keep it in place.,Neutral
"Nice fabric...cute...no depth, too shallow for thick long hair....",Neutral
"Being a first time cane user, I didn’t realize it until I used it for a while, but the area of my hand that rests(sometimes heavily)on the cane is textured carved wood (the mane of a horse)that rubs and irritates my palm!  It is beautiful, but utility took a back seat to beauty!",Neutral

Product is great... but came three days later than expected.,Neutral
"These earrings are so cute, BUT they hurt my ears :(<br />The back is plastic and for whatever reason is not as comfortable as a metal backing. I find myself not choosing these to wear often bc of this.",Neutral
I ordered these for our cruise on the Mardi Gras. It would not stick to the doors it worked on the cabin walls but not the doors. Not sure if the newer ships doors are different than the older ships. I did not pack tape so could not use as a room finder. They looked nice though. Just not very strong with its magnetic power.,Neutral
This picture it self is not worth the money I could have had this printed myself for cheaper. When I put it in this frame it all came together .,Neutral
One of them earrings were broken off in the bag and I had to glue it back on. The backs to the earrings are so loose they fell right off that I had to us the rubber piece that came with it.,Neutral
I wish it was shiny gold and the ring was gold it would look my better,Neutral
The panel requires purchase of coloring pens to finish it off as pictured. The muslin it is printed in is a bit thin also.,Neutral
Its really cute! But the number was gone by scratching after few weeks.,Neutral
Not at all the same wood stain color as product photo but still neat. Wish it stood out more.,Neutral
My mom just received this in the mail... She loved it until she tried to but it on... Knots all in the chain... So she took off the vertical bar and birthstone and placed it on another chain she had...,Neutral
The clip is a little difficult to snap to your jacket or scrub top. The badge real is also a little hard to get your tags on due to the type of clip it is but I do love the style and my name being on it.,Neutral
Shirt quality is soft but it runs big and if you want to exchange it you have to pay for shipping.,Neutral

"going to keep this puppy with the 20% restocking fee and return shipping not paid.  that's 50% of the cost.  whoooooooops.  may be a quality item, but does it matter?",Neutral
Cute keychain but just about the size of a quarter. Metal is very thin and would bend easily if shoved in a pocket. I kept because it is cute and it sits protected in my purse and not a pocket.,Neutral
"Neat , creative idea but just waaaay to expensive for a piece of thick sheet of paper. Could have also included some clips or a board to get the sheet on for the guests. Great idea but overpriced .",Neutral
I like this simple ring that I can use with other stackable bands. I was very disappointed that the lettering was very difficult the see. It was not  a deep black but light grey/brown color.,Neutral
It’s just like in the picture but the metal part holding the stone cuts my skin. It’s not folded correctly and it bothers,Neutral
Makes a great gift,Neutral
The chain broke in the first month,Neutral
Probably my fault for not reading the description. This or I’m at is a piece of wood printed with the horse on it. Not a 3 demential glass ornament. I’m guessing it probably said it somewhere but I didn’t see that.,Neutral
On one ring should sell 2-4 in a unit.,Neutral
"Order details: Ordered on 2/6 and arrived on 2/17<br />Size: Extra small<br />Color: Shiny steel<br /><br />Small but fits all necessary information, I was able to fit 4 lines in the back with two phone numbers, vaccinated, and microchipped. Knocking off stars because the shiny steel makes it difficult to read so I recommend getting the industrial steel.",Neutral
"This item took a very long time to arrive after ordering.  When I finally received the necklace, my daughter loved it.  However, the name snapped off from the chain after about a month.  Very disappointing.",Neutral
Smaller then thought and missing COA,Neutral
Arrived sooner than expected but also larger than expected.,Neutral
Cute,Neutral
The necklace is pretty but if you wear it all day it will change colors on you.,Neutral
Pretty but very small - better for a young girl,Neutral
"Item is nice. But, overpriced.<br />Some of the stickers were pealing along their edges.<br />Definitely better than other boxes at this price.<br />Looks fantastic on the wall.<br />But, in hand....<br />While the weight is impressive, the smooth & slightly slick feel, is not.",Neutral

Halloween ready!,Neutral
"I love the look and feel but while the stated length is 15 inches, what I received is only about 13.5 inches unless you add the length of the hanging loop.<br />Looks like I'll have to 'go back to the well' anyway as I now realize that even if it had been the full 15 inches it would have been a little too short for reaching across my oven door.",Neutral
"They look great. Bought as gift for the kids bathroom. However, only 3 of 4 prints were delivered.",Neutral
Love this headband but it took FOREVER to receive.,Neutral
This folder was for my granddaughter for school. I loved the folder it was beautiful but the top of it was wrinkled. Very disappointed.,Neutral
"The bad news....the print was delayed twice, but UPS came through on the second date (busy shipping time of the year, I get it).  The paper print had two minor creases, not severe, but not noticeable (I hope).  Paper prints may not be an option going forward.  Return is not an option either, don't wish to go through it again.  Maybe a canvas print to replace it later, but too anxious to get it on the wall of the river home.<br /><br />The good news....print quality is very nice. Nice enough to be framed without glass (just like canvas).  Framing material (cedar), D-rings and push pins are ready in the woodworking shop.  This may have been Carel Fabritius' last painting.  In 2003 it was cleaned, and tiny indentations were found in the surface with no cracks (possibly created before the paint even dried) maybe caused by the Delft Thunderclap.  A gunpowder factory exploded and destroyed a good portion of the city.  Killing about hundred people, Fabritius being one of them.<br /><br />Always admired this painting.  The bird looks as if it could fly right off the surface.  Evidently these birds were 'trainable'; hence, the gold chain securing it to the perch.  I guess it was 'The Pet Goldfinch'.  I have read the original is worth about $300 million.<br /><br />Very pleased to have it in my collection.<br /><br />Post Review:<br />Turned out just stunning!  Can't even see minor indentations and didn't even have to add glass front.",Neutral
Looks great! But part of the lettering is coming  after the first wash.,Neutral
It's ok,Neutral
"Looks good but I thought it came with a frame. My fault I didn't read close enough, but without a frame it was way too expensive.",Neutral
"I wanted this as an author to sign.. room to sign is very small, but nice picture.",Neutral
The paper is flimsy and they look like they were Xeroxed on a cheap copier.,Neutral
"Basically decent product for price. Very plain looking and unable to generally determine which side is front or back.  Photo looks better than actual item. Paper insert very generic and also cannot determine front from back until you write on it.<br /><br />Should offer initialing.<br /><br />Again, not a bad product for the money, but just very plain and generic. Will see how leather wears.",Neutral
Some of the letters were not clear. But the piece is still pretty.,Neutral
It's a very pretty necklace. But the stone is so small and the chain it's on fits more like a choker than a necklace. Kind of disappointed in the amount we paid for something that looks more like an accessory for a child,Neutral
These were just too tiny for me to be able to put them in my ear.  I kept the 12mm size & even that was a challenge to secure the earring in my piercing.,Neutral
It is very small for the price,Neutral
"This is not for a man, I gave it to my wife & she loved it!",Neutral
"[[VIDEOID:e3f606745d4a8961c875b0b580b0c83]] Wished the gem was bigger and the rose color was more pronounced,  but it’s nice.",Neutral
"It is pretty and delicate, seems like good quality, but is tiny. Entire length is just over 6 1/4”. never saw a bracelet that could come in an earring size box. Thought it was something else I had ordered till I opened. If you are expecting any kind of dangle from this dangle bracelet you better be extremely petite or under 10 years old. Bought as a gift for an adult and there is no way it is going to fit so has to go back....",Neutral
The overall quality of workmanship is rather poor but the price is moderate so I guess it's not a terrible value.,Neutral
Cute. It did look shinier than expected. It was a cute purchase and for the price a great gift.,Neutral
"Would’ve been nice if I had the correct side , ordered the left got the right and had to put it in backwards . Other then that it’s fine .",Neutral
It's cute and serves its purpose but the text is unevenly bolded. I like that I can make it tighter or looser as needed,Neutral
"These leather barrettes are thick and not cheaply made, but the holes are too far apart.  They slip and release my hair.  I have thick hair, but even my thick hair is not enough to fill the space between the holes so that it is held securely in place.",Neutral
Broke within 2 months,Neutral
"For the price, this should come with the pens to use.",Neutral
"Purchased as a gift and it came early, beautiful bracelet but as soon as I went to unclasp it, it broke. Mine may have just been a faulty one. It’s truly a beautiful gift that I would have loved to give.",Neutral

I thought the burlap would have been tighter.,Neutral
"I loved the way the earrings looked, but the posts really hurt my earlobe; therefore I will not be able to keep them on very long.",Neutral
"I actually took this to get blown up into a poster and then framed it to give as a gift, then it seemed appropriate. Love what it says but the 8x10 original size didn’t make the impact I’d hoped. She loved it btw.",Neutral
"Purchased as a gift. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that the color awful.  I expected a brown leather wallet, but what I received is gray.  I don't like the gray at all.  I bought it for my boyfriend because the wallet I purchased for him last year that was said to be genuine leather was not.  That so called leather pealed off and it's just pure ugly.  I don't think he likes the color either. He still hasn't switched over and I know he hates the wallet from last year.",Neutral
I like it bt material harder than I thought,Neutral
Wire around heart is not secure constantly kept getting caught up on clothes and became mangled looking eventually had to cut it off,Neutral
Purchased (2) because I wanted to give one to my Mama... sadly returned both. The charm is too small so you can’t really tell what it is until you’re close enough to focus in. I wouldn’t have minded the size if the design was made simply and identifiable.,Neutral
It’s just a fancy piece of plastic,Neutral
"This product is an excellent idea, and handy, convenient and seems pretty well made. BUT-- it's a bit big, as it allows towels to hang down just a bit too low off your stove handle.  The crocheted, button part needs to be about an inch or so shorter, and the ring smaller, for a tighter fit for the towel. Like I said, great idea, as plastic clips others sell snap and break. But this needs to be smaller. Overall decent product! 😊",Neutral
"UPDATE:  I didnt know you were supposed to peel off the backing with the grid lines! I was doing it wrong !It should come with instructions for people who have no clue. Once you peel away the grid lines the name stands alone. It looks great now. However, it took way too long to arrive and it was a birthday gift. I ordered this on July 22nd and received it August 20th. I did not understand why there are visible grid lines on the finished product. They should explain that you peel off the backing with the gridlines. I like this product now that I did it properly.",Neutral
I really loved the anklet when I first got it.  Its beautifully made and very sturdy.  However 2 days after I put it on. I went swimming in a chlorinated pool and it faded a lot!  I am so disappointed.  In some lights it looks brown now and I specifically wanted black to match the majority of my outfits,Neutral
Love this headband but it took FOREVER to receive.,Neutral
"I dont give the 5 start review because it is very bulky, its supposed to be a journal that can be bent and stuck on your pockets any time eerywhere, but it is very tough and cant be easily bent",Neutral
"The picture of the chair has colors through out the weave,however, the chairs I received are flat brown. I was so excited about starting my own doll house with your woven chairs. The chairs are well woven and shaped nicely.",Neutral
"These are small, which I knew before buying, but the paint on them is pretty sloppy. Rustic would be a nice word to use. I would not recommend this product.",Neutral
Pretty but doesn’t stay tight on the wrist,Neutral
It was okay would of been nice if each piece was sealed,Neutral
So tiny can barely read name,Neutral
The necklace is beautiful and lightweight. It is just short of 2” at about 1 3/4” but still an acceptable size.<br />The only issue I had with the purchase that was a gift for me is the necklace itself is different than what is shown in the photo and other reviewers photos.<br />The photos show a black rope like cord with a metal ring. The actual cord that came with the pendant is a very thin and cheap fake leather material with an adjustable slide knot.  So now I have to go out and purchase a real black rope cord like shown as this is what I wanted and expected.  Removing 2 stars for the bait and switch.,Neutral
I expected the pearls to be a little larger.,Neutral
Really like the style and design but the design doesn’t fit together correctly.,Neutral
"Not comfortable around wrist. Incredibly stiff. Otherwise, nicely made.",Neutral
Not worth what I paid. Could have done it myself and printed it for a whole lot less. I thought it would be hand painted - or at least come with the frame,Neutral
"Although pretty, more for a child than an adult. They are very small. I had to send them back. They completely got lost on my ears. I guess they would be good for a second hole but they did not look flattering on me.",Neutral
"It just feels real cheap not very practical but I am going to give it a chance just don’t feel it’s worth the price and don’t feel like it will hold to the wind , rain and elements but I will sincerely give an update after this summer juts don’t feel it will last that long<br />Sorry that’s I’m opinion",Neutral
"I liked the quality, but the laces were way too short to go all the way up like they should have. I had to buy some used lace to use.",Neutral
A bit on the cheap and flimsy side.,Neutral
"It smells lovely, softens my hair nice and no build up. Only used it once so far but I liked it",Neutral
It's definitely handmade and cleans super well anf doesn't feel sticky or soapy residue . It smells nice but not very much. The perfume does last for a while and it's not an overwhelming scent which I like.,Neutral
Not strong,Neutral
"I love these corbels, but the weight of the quartz counter made them sag a tad, so we had to use shims to make the counter level. They still look and work, but they aren't perfectly square, and have a space that needs to be filled where the shim is. We made sure to get 9&#34; corbels with a 12&#34; overhang counter, so it should be able to hold without bowing. Also, it didn't come with black headed bolts to match, so that was kind of a bummer.",Neutral
A little disappointed at the size,Neutral
Beautiful earrings and I got lots of compliments but after a month in a half they just started falling apart.,Neutral
A lot smaller than I thought,Neutral
"It’s a cute keychain but made of cheap thin silver metal that will be scratched up very quickly. I was definitely disappointed. It’s cute to look at, just wish it was a better quality silver disk. It feels cheap instead of the quality it could be with how cute the idea is.",Neutral
"I had assumed this sign included a frame.  It seemed like it had one in the image.  It did not.  At any rate, I did return it.",Neutral
Like the design of these small earrings but I wished they will be more substantial. It’s a thin gold wire with a half moon shape.,Neutral
"I liked it very much when I took it out of the pretty packaging.  It's very light weight and attractive.  But the hold isn't very tight.  Perhaps my nostril area (?) is very thin, but unless I'm sitting in a chair reading a book it will fall off.",Neutral
"Super duper cute, but unfortunately it is a very fragile.. mine broke after hardly a few weeks.",Neutral
NIce but arrived all wadded up,Neutral
Picture shows the tie attached to collar. I like how the bow tie attaches to my dogs existing collar. Size is good and seems to be made of quality fabric. It's a bit pricy for just a box tie.,Neutral
Very nice scent but only lasted about 10 seconds.,Neutral
The product is cute and durable but the fish shaped one is not balanced. it leans on one side and looks bigger and unproportional.,Neutral
Bought this for my friend's 40th birthday.,Neutral
"The case itself is fairly good. It protects the phone well enough. However, the engraving itself has already come off. That’s is disappointing.",Neutral
Good quality but lots of threads which make me fear injury to my little hedgehog. I was it once a week and the threads just keep on coming.,Neutral
Shirt wayyyyyyyyy to big!,Neutral
A little small and chain isn't ideal but over all cute necklace,Neutral
The size is so tiny and I now have to buy spacers from someone bc they can't be seen next to each other worn as a name or initials u can't see them bunched together !!!!!,Neutral
"""The Vegvisir symbol is very old and sacred. Viking and Norse sailors used this symbol as it was believed to show the way back home and protect them from storms. This is why it is also said to be a viking compass.""-from the product description. Yeah thats actually complete crap. The real Vikings never used it, they wouldnt have even known what it was. Heres the truth: The symbol known as “vegvísir” is an celandic folk feature borrowed from continental occult magic “Solomon's testament”. It is about 160 years old and its use is limited to the 2nd half of 19th century in an Icelandic city of Akureyri.Apr 5, 2019. That being said, I do like and enjoy Vegvisir, but I also understand that its a modern ""viking"" thing and not true Viking history or culture.",Neutral
Thought it was an actual paper but it’s just a photo of the actual paper so it looks pretty cheap and ghetto but once it’s framed it’s dope!,Neutral
"I purchased this bracelet and was so excited!  Quick Shipping, Beautiful Bracelet but the quality was not the best.  It seemed as though links that attach the chain and plaque are not closed all the way and it snags on things. I reached out and they immediately sent me a new one.  I took it upon myself to tighten the new ones so they won't snag but it tore after about 3 weeks. I am really bumped.",Neutral
"They are comfortable to wear, but not made very well.  The prong settings aren’t even and snag on things and have sharp point.",Neutral
"Loved it, but broke after a few weeks.",Neutral
"Craftsmanship is excellent but I'm very disappointed in the stone I received. It's not nearly as nice as the one in the picture. Would not give as gift but will wear myself. A little pricey for what I actually got. If the stone was nicer, I would be happy with the price.",Neutral
Nothing like picture. The shirt is like green and super tight. It also took forever to arrive,Neutral
"this looked like a type of jewelry that I purchase in my town However visually Pleasing in the photo but quality is less than expected.  In particular, the stones.  they had little sense of depth and seemed like paper topped with a little glass bubble.  Also the metal was not as heavy as I had expected.  I returned the necklace with no problem.",Neutral
"The ones that arrived, while very pretty, are not the ones ordered.",Neutral
They are beautiful but the metal was super cheap and flimsy,Neutral
"Very pretty, but didn't stay on my cup very well.",Neutral
Kind off small but will do the job.,Neutral
The container was cracked when it arrived.,Neutral
The print is already flaking off and the tower and background are not clearly defined like they are both dark the phase is the only thing you can clearly make out honestly,Neutral
Smells weird not sweet,Neutral
Pages are tiny and there's not much room to write anything much. About as useful as a post it note.,Neutral
"Easy to lose, doesn’t clasp closed",Neutral
"Got this for my husband, he's yet to use it because the size of the pot and not being able to find a good plant to grow in it. It is cute and good quality just small.",Neutral
Did not do what was said,Neutral
My necklace is very nice -was received a s a gift.  the photo shows an almost translucent dark green stone.  My stone is almost sea foam green and creamy- no reflected light at all.  The silver work is nice and the necklace is long enough for me but as already mentioned the clasp link is small.  I know natural stones can vary in color mine is so very different than shown or any malachite I've seen. Would send it back if it hadn't been a gift,Neutral
The item was smaller than I expected.,Neutral
Poor finish quality but was something you could clean up/fix easy enough.,Neutral
Muy linda sin embargo con menos de 3 usos se ha ido deteriorando. No es de muy buena calidad.,Neutral
But not on my finger.,Neutral
I don’t want to discourage future shoppers but the pic on Amazon and what you get is very different. The glitter option is pretty messy there’s lines further out from the graphic of a fine glitter it’s not as you would expect. You can read the saying but I that’s it. The name on the back of mine is so small also not like the image. I’m pretty bummed it isn’t what was shown especially waiting the full ship time plus some.,Neutral
Product arrived bent. Was way more of an oval then a hoop. Looks funky on because she was not correct,Neutral
"Very pretty and dainty necklace, however, the clasp is a little too long.",Neutral
Let me start by saying this sign is on card stock but I don’t mind that at all because I don’t want anything that weighs too much hanging around my sons neck. The size is great. Reason I’m giving three stars is because of the marker work and the handwriting. I thought this would have been printed out and would be neat. Someone clearly took a sharpie and was messy with the writing. I don’t want to spend more money from a higher quality shop since my son most likely won’t wear this down the aisle anyway. But if you want something Of higher quality; spend the extra money,Neutral
"While I did wear this almost everyday, and I'm a pretty active guy, the clasp is not durable enough to withstand any sort of abuse.",Neutral
The Bracelet is to small for a adult is more like for younger kids. Still looks elegant!!,Neutral
"Unfortunately, picture made me feel this was larger than it was. It was very cute just way to small for the spot I had picked for it. Maybe something else in the picture to help you judge the size. Had to return but I will keep my eye out for something larger.",Neutral
But too small,Neutral
Looks great but broke before too long.,Neutral
It's cute but for the price I paid I'm a little worried it won't last very long. It's suppose to have a distressed look but it's very &#34;distressed&#34; is this suppose to happen??,Neutral
Cute & quality is good but this nose ring is too big.,Neutral

"I had to do a lot of bending and squeezing just to get it on my nose, which is okay, except it was all mis-shaped by the time I got it on, and really small. I'm not sure if the sizing is for the gauge size or the size of the ring itself, but it was alright. I'd recommend it if it was half the price.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought but still very subtly lovely !,Neutral
"I’m very pleased with the speed of ordering & size of the ring. But, the ring I received had to be returned. I ordered the dark stain and it wore off in 2 days and stained my finger. Also, the cut end was sharp. I don’t believe it was finished properly. I have other coin rings that are crafted much better.",Neutral
I love the ring it’s so pretty just what I wanted,Neutral
"I was hoping for more of the butterscotch scent and the smell of butterbeer like we had in Universal Studios. This doesn’t smell bad, but It’s not what I was hoping for. It kind of smells like butterscotch with a hint of beer. They sent a sample of buttered popcorn along with my order and it definitely smelled like the description. Their wax melts are highly scented.",Neutral
Thought picture was a lot bigger<br />But my kid still likes the photo,Neutral
Pretty small,Neutral
Alright,Neutral

"I bought this as a gift for my sister and the letter &#34;D&#34; that I requested was not as pretty as expected.  I guess it is just the font, but the &#34;B&#34; in the picture is pretty and I guess I thought the &#34;D&#34; would be pretty as well.  Probably no fault of the designer, I just didn't like the particular letter. Otherwise, it was as expected.",Neutral
I love this idea! I bought a single bag and tested it to see if it truly is biodegradable and disappears with moisture like a previous comment said.... some of the materials did bit some did not. I am disappointed that I spent this much on something I don't think I will get to use now.,Neutral
"My son LOVES this toy, but after ONE day of very gentle use (hugging, not throwing or tearing) the side seam popped and he pulled out its stuffing.

The materials are nice and soft and it is overall perfect, but I was very disappointed in the seam.",Neutral
"They worked great for the wine bottles! However, I ordered two & I only got one. So some of my bottles just aren't going to have a label on them.",Neutral

"The price of these bracelets are great. They do not last a long time as the string gets worn out fast and snap easily. Mine lasted about 2 weeks before breaking and the other one broke 2 days after that. They are cute, abd the magnetic heart didnt connect properly unless you adjust it to create the heart. It's cute for a short time.",Neutral
a couple of the prints were super poor quality :(,Neutral
It is nice but I didn’t know it was just a piece of paper. Kinda pricey for that. Put it in a frame and it’s cute.,Neutral
"The leather is good quality and the color was true to the pic. I wish the stamp with my company name was a little darker though, you can barely read it. I was also hoping my name would be on both top and bottom, but at this price I'm pretty happy with the purchase. These tags take my crocheted items to the next level of professionalism. Everyone says the items look like they were bought at a high end store.",Neutral
Way bigger than advertised. I can’t really wear It because it’s so big. It is really pretty though.,Neutral

"I like the wooden name a lot. But, it had flaws. First, i had to sand the edges of the name because the edges weren’t smooth & pieces of wood were sticking out. (like wood tearout)<br />Second, I paid extra for it to be painted white. It was painted nicely besides the back of the dot that goes on the “i”. It was dirty & not painted. I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good. Just disappointing when you pay that much money & the product has these issues with it that i had to take the time to fix / edit to make it right.",Neutral
I got this for my daughter and when she opened it it was much smaller than I thought it would be. It’s about half the size of a normal snow globe.,Neutral

"These giraffes are cute and quite large! They fill the space nicely. However- they are harder to put up  than they seem because each spot, eye, ear, etc is it’s own individual piece, and there is no shape or template to use. After a few attempts of trying to get them to look right by going freeform, I ended up tracing the shape of the necks on paper, then on the wall. Once I did that, it went by quickly and came out very cute.<br /><br />Also- your wall color will be the background of the giraffes. Our walls are a kind of peachy beige so it worked well, but it would probably look strange with other colors.",Neutral
Do not have picture of missing product!! If We had product we would not have a problem,Neutral
It very cheep and bit as hard as i thought it would be. It also didnt have yhe frame. Its good for its price tho.,Neutral
Chain to small\weak,Neutral

Only problem with this is you can't get it to close by opening the way they say to... Other than that it's ok,Neutral
"I thought that this would be cut out of cardboard, but when I received it, it was on photo paper and not a cardboard cut out.

You get what you pay for, I guess",Neutral
It's overall a nice bracelet and my granddaughter enjoys hers very much. I was disappointed in the colors. The colors are not as vivid as shown in the picture of the ad on Amazon.,Neutral
"It's pretty, but by the way this is described, and for $55, I had every reason to expect that although not sterling silver of course, that the main center piece of the necklace, would be of decent, durable quality... put together to sustain wearing the necklace. Instead, the center piece of the necklace, is thin mixed metal, with the faux turquoise glued on top of it, such that my fingernail goes in all around between 'stone' and thin metal to which it is glued, ie, it's likely to come off. This necklace center piece is the quality of Walmart costume jewelry, not bought in the jewelry section even. The faux turquoise and faux silver beading seems like it will sustain wearing without breaking, but the main event... the center piece is a major let down in quality. A faux stone glued onto very thin, mass produced template cut metal. I'm returning it, and will put $55 towards a better quality necklace.",Neutral
This is a cool photo but I guess the frame wasn't included.,Neutral
It’s a beautiful bracelet but haven’t felt any changes and it’s been over a month. We’ll see if anything changes ...,Neutral
Too flimsy..it went down the drain the first day..did not get to wear it...,Neutral
They all have a similar smell but they are very loud and smell good,Neutral
Scratches,Neutral
"It was  a good sheath , however the belt loop part was screwed together very poorly with one screw going one direction and one going the other direction. I fixed the sheath myself .overall not a bad buy .",Neutral
Fun home made gift!!,Neutral
Very pretty but didn't come with anything saying what it was...no even a box! FYI this id a gift too!,Neutral
"They are cute earrings except mine have some spots where they are discolored, like the gold plating came off. Some spots are silver instead of gold",Neutral
"Not super thick gauge, but looks nice nevertheless and will function well.",Neutral
Good!,Neutral
"These are really pretty earrings. The mother of pearl is so light and polished it looks like resin. I put these on to try and they felt great, like I wasn't even wearing earrings - except for the part where the back of the earring kept getting caught in my long hair and getting twisted. By the time I went to take these out, the back of one earring had twisted really terribly and it was weird to take it out because it wasn't smooth at all. I was able to push the back into shape, but now I'm worried about wearing these and getting bumped weirdly so that it squashes the back and makes taking the earring off difficult. I'll definitely wear these with caution moving forward.",Neutral
"It’s cute yes but the name is separate from the ball. Making it looked overlapped and clearly a decal.  Had it just printed as one piece it would have looked much better. It looked so badly I ended up peeling the name off and placing the name under the ball. Also, when placing the name on the wall I had great difficulty getting it to separate from the backing paper.  I am a seasoned wall decal placer so it wasn’t my inexperience. So yes cute but not what I expected.",Neutral
If I bought again I would get it in tan which suits its casual style more than the red.,Neutral
"We bought two of these, the stones inside are small to none. One has a small hole in the side and is fraying and itchy on the necklace, Fills like string was glued together",Neutral
Really cool painting but no frame. It was advertised with a frame and now this thing has been sitting for months without a frame because I work too much and haven’t Been able to buy a damn frame because then you forget the size and you question yourself. I’ve bought no joke 3 wrong frames. PLEASE SEND ME A FRAME!,Neutral
These are lovely earrings for a child or person with short hair.<br />I have long hair and they were invisible. One of the stones had a tiny chip.,Neutral
"The first one I ordered came in the correct color, brown. The second one did NOT, it was gray. I  have no use for a gray one. However it was well made, packaged well and fast delivery.",Neutral
"My daughter loved the design of this ear cuff and the way it sits on her ear. Craftsmanship itself is beautiful - hammered surface is quite attractive. The reason for a 3-star rating is that the items is announced as made of sterling silver and it turned out to be silver-plated at best. The cuff does not have a '925' imprint (or any other imprints); it has a metallic smell and reacts with a magnet albeit lightly, which it shouldn't if it were made of sterling silver. The seller may want to adjust the description of this item to reflect the real material it is made of, which crucial to know especially for a buyer with allergies as some metals can cause skin reactions.",Neutral
Tore very easily,Neutral
The colors are not as vibrant as I wanted,Neutral
"The globe containing the mustard seed continuously separates and falls off the chain.  This has happened a dozen times or so.  Fortunately so far, I have been able to see / feel / hear it when it lands on the floor, but at some point I fear that I will not notice when it happens and I'll lose it.",Neutral
"The mug is perfect for any Ark fan. The inside keeps drinks hot or cold depending on what you pour into it. The problem is washing the mug, the inside is easily cleaned but the outside wood layer can chip away if washed with soap and water. My advice wash the inside only. If the outside is dirty get a cloth and dab it lightly in water the scrub.",Neutral
"It was nearly impossible to get the circle to work around the monogram, so I just left it off.  Works fine without it.",Neutral
The piece with the beads popped off after a week.  I still can wear the solid chain.,Neutral
"So so, plastic, can't read the writing, have to put another color on it.",Neutral
Gifted to a manager,Neutral
This necklace is so beautiful but far to delicate. I had it for two weeks and the glass separated from the silver. So disappointed because I searched for something like this for a while. Looking for a different product now. So disappointed.,Neutral
"This bracelet is beautiful, yet ocean glass is too large and it's uncomfortable to wear",Neutral
The photo won’t come framed. I even paid for it the second time and it still came without a frame.,Neutral
Magnet not as strong as expected<br />😐. Love the color of the stone,Neutral
The laser engraving was perfect but disappointed with the quality of the glass.  I assumed it would be a heavier more expensive glass,Neutral
"It is not at all ""Super Soft & ""Super Comfy"" - it is stiff and tremendous in size.  The seller does say it runs large, but a woman's large is actually the size of a man's large. Maybe a wash or two will soften it, but it will not shrink it and I am stuck with it...no returns.",Neutral
"A nice, easy nosering but very easy to bend or break so it doesn't have its round shape anymore",Neutral
"I bought this as a gift for my sister and the letter &#34;D&#34; that I requested was not as pretty as expected.  I guess it is just the font, but the &#34;B&#34; in the picture is pretty and I guess I thought the &#34;D&#34; would be pretty as well.  Probably no fault of the designer, I just didn't like the particular letter. Otherwise, it was as expected.",Neutral
Actual nose ring is smaller than what it looks like on the model in the catalog,Neutral
"Be advised: I ordered this and when it arrived I immediately notice something odd- the poster was actually a PHOTOGRAPH of a print, not the print itself. It was on photographic paper. Once I framed it, however it looked great. Worth the price since we have a horn exactly like this in our family!",Neutral
You get exactly what you see Period,Neutral
Pretty disappointed... not even a hint of the blue that it is supposed to be....,Neutral
I love the bracelet so much the only problem was they took the personalized messages and put them on the wrong side! Also it's very tight to make bigger I'm afraid it's going to break.,Neutral
"Unless you have a large wrist / hand, consider yourself warned.<br /><br />This is beautiful but I’m really upset there’s no sizing options",Neutral
"This was just a print out. Nice, but there was no frame. Kind of a bit of a rip for the money that I spent on it...it's really just a sheet of paper.",Neutral
This is not Jade. It is Kambaba Jasper.,Neutral
"the lettering is not a bold black as shown in the photos ,,, therefore rather hard to read,,, exspecially on a shiny surface ,,, its a gift so hope the receipiant can read it",Neutral
It's a little chunky I've had better but it doesn't make my lips burn so thats good.,Neutral
[[VIDEOID:de59118f97f9e0e9ab240025ff6e8e36]] Cute! Easy to assemble and looks just like a mouse head.,Neutral
It's cute.,Neutral
"The paper, while a decent weight and seemed decent....the ""gold"" shown in the picture is nothing like that in reality.  It is more of a flat cream color with beige highlights, not at all looking like the photo where it looks metallic gold.  Also, while packaged tightly there was a  tear in one sheet. Not sure if that will be visible upon mounting, but for the price and shipping costs it's highly disappointing.<br />**After contact with vendor, I have amended to 3 stars because while there was some back and forth, ultimately they worked with me to resolve situation satisfactorily.",Neutral
"Very cute but looks like something anyone can make. Elastic with beads and cute charm, but not worth the money.",Neutral
"The words aren’t clear enough to read, most especially in the center where they are smallest.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought,Neutral
"We really like the print, but it came bent. We kept it because you aren't likely to notice the crease in the frame, but  Amazon should really take more care with shipping items like this. If not for that, I would have said 5 stars.",Neutral
"I wanted to love it, and did initially. It's very pretty brand new but a bit stiff. I was hopeful it would soften with wear, and while it did do that, it also lost is leather (cheaply peeled off ""leather"") after just a couple weeks of wear. And not even constant wear. I was disappointed with the leather mostly, but that is a large component of the piece. The beads are pretty. Shiny and vibrant.",Neutral
"They are tiny in comparison to the photo but they are cute, should be made bigger, I'd buy more if they did",Neutral
I thought the paper would be thicker like poster board but it was very light,Neutral
"I didn't get the print I had thought I ordered (had incorrect quote), but the colors were very lovely. Unfortunately, it came a little bent at a corner. The frame I put it in covered that just fine. No worries.",Neutral
"Thinner fabric than I expected and took awhile to get here. The colors are pretty , just fade away due to fabric. Not what I expected.",Neutral
Nice design and word work but I don't think this birdhouse will holdup very well hanging outside in the elements.  It needs to be assembled. I ended up using wood glue to strengthen the cut-out notches that hold it together.,Neutral
It’s just like in the picture but the metal part holding the stone cuts my skin. It’s not folded correctly and it bothers,Neutral
So I opened the package tried to put it on it just fell down the drain. It is extremely thin and small cute but not worth the price even if I didn’t lose it. I never tried it on but it looks just like the picture just very small,Neutral
The bee is not connected to the honey,Neutral
"These are small and dainty but they are not gold— they are a yellow brass color and they don’t match with any of my other gold earrings. I don’t think I’ll end up wearing them, as they look very artificial.",Neutral
Really like the idea but the engraving wears off quickly if you actually use as a key-chain.,Neutral
"Very strong smell for the first hour but quickly fades to nothing. Lotion wise, not the most moisturizing but will do as a backup if your preferred aftershave unexpectedly runs out",Neutral
I use wax melts of. My desk at work. I was soooo excited about the chocolate scented melts. I was rather disappointed in these melts.  It didn't have a strong chocolate scent. People in my area didn't realize I was using them.,Neutral
Just not that great. Looks like some one went to hobby lobby and bought the cheapest beads they could find and made it themselves.  I would be disappointed if someone gave it to me as a gift.,Neutral
Bought this for my husband for a blessing and good thoughts.  Looks good in him. He hasn't lost it but the knot keeps coming off,Neutral
"The quality of the product is good, it stays on the nose as promiced, but it's too small, for me it's so small that it looks really fake when worn. When buying keep in mind where your nostril ""line"" is, if it's on the higher points of your nose, then you can skip buying the product, whereas if your line is on the lower side this might fit you well.",Neutral
"I loved it, but its very delicate and broke after less than a day.",Neutral
"It's nice and the text was done correctly, but it's a bit hard to read against the clear background.  Plus, after the first line the text is too small to make out easily.  The ornament is kind of plain as well, but my husband was touched by it and therefore I am happy with it.",Neutral
I got cheaper rings that haven’t faded yet this ring faded pretty quick and I wear the other ones more than this one,Neutral
I put it in my granddaughters bedroom they come Unstuck after a couple of days,Neutral
The engraving is very shallow and the phone number is put along the bottom and it wore off in a month.  It was pretty when I first got it.  It's very heavy though as it seems to be solid stainless steel.  It does me no good if my dog gets lost and the person who finds her can't read my phone number.  Would be better to put the number through the middle or higher.,Neutral
These earrings are very tiny and much smaller than they show.  They are nice though.,Neutral
It’s pretty cute but thin and doesn’t seem like very good quality. It’s cheap so that’s not surprising but you can barely even feel the name on the metal which I assume means that it will eventually rub off to the point where you can no longer read the name anymore. My arm is very thin and the bracelet even looks incredibly thin on me. I wouldn’t buy it again unless it was a gift for a small child.,Neutral
I dont like the fact that only one screw goes in the plate.,Neutral
"Really liked the esthetic of the images, we framed them and hung them up in our living room only to discover that the Sperm whale had a little too much going on (whale is depicted dead with tongue & penis hanging out). Took that photo down and are enjoying the others",Neutral
Necklace fell apart shortly after receiving it the metal eyelet pulled out,Neutral
"My husband purchased 2 rings for Valentine's day. One says the word Love (which is matte) and the other is our anniversary date (which is the rose gold). I was quite disappointed when I received them. I can barely see the word or the date. I wish they made it a little bigger and darker. Also, there is an imperfection next to the one letter. I don't think I'd order again.",Neutral
"Loved the design, but the quality of the actual shirt was very thin and a little see through. (Got the white shirt)",Neutral
Very cute cup design was expecting a little more of the quality of the cup itself. Does leak a little. Overall my daughter loves the design.,Neutral
"They are fine, but the picture shows gold. They are silver, so not 100% what I wanted.",Neutral
quality is low but the godzilla legacy remains,Neutral
"The initial 'S' is too scroll-y to be identifiable as an 'S' and it is not attached to the wreath; it's a DIY. Also there is no string or hanger for hanging. Other than that, it's beautiful.",Neutral
"The bracelet is nice, but the little dangly cross is pretty trashy looking.  The rest of the bracelet is fine, though.",Neutral
Cute but cheaply made and not worth $ 26,Neutral
"Super cute earring. Turned out to be very light and movable which i really liked however, i only wore it twice and the feather fell off both times and is now lost. I was even really particular about following their directions to twist and not bend.",Neutral
We love these but in the picture it makes it look like they are significantly larger than in reality.,Neutral
Nice shirt overall. Ordered a 3x but it was more like a 1x. Order accordingly.,Neutral
"This is a great look and is comfortable, however, the craftsmanship and materials are lacking for the price. The charm fell off as the link bent easily. Then the silver wears off leaving copper color along edges and turning your wrist green anytime exposed to moisture. Very disappointing since the cost is so much higher.",Neutral
CUTE NECKLACE BUT TURNS FAST AND NOT MADE OF SLIVER 925,Neutral
I have a nickel allergy that results in hives so I cannot even use this item. I got hives the first day I wore this.,Neutral
"When looking and thinking a fleece blanket you automatically think the typical size nice and long, there were no measurements on site so I assumed. The blanket is quite small my dog is 80 pounds so I wish there was information about that on-site so I’d know to look elsewhere to fit my boy. However the blanket is very soft and the font is cute I’d definitely recommend this for dogs under 25 pounds",Neutral
It's very small and i don't think it's worthy for paying whipping fee $4 and $18,Neutral
"Memento Mori, a sterling silver manifestation of a person that's practicing stoicism. If this ring were solid it would be fire. This is my second Memento Mori ring from Secretium. The first ring the skull and book piece fell off. 😔 Since then I've order a second that seem thing is going to happen.",Neutral
Well it hasn't broke yet,Neutral
very nice quality sticker and adorable; but i’m not sure i’d have ordered it if i’d realized how itty bitty it was.,Neutral
The material frays from mat. Shipped in plastic wrap.,Neutral
Very disappointed with my purchase.  I bought the bracelet base on the reviews. I have to say it was deliver faster that I was expecting. Very happy with that. I have to say also that it is a beautiful piece. I read the instructions before I wore it follow every detail to keep my bracelet safe from scratches and guess what my bracelet still scratches. That makes me sad my plan wad wear the bracelet in memorial of my mom but I have to put it away because I dont want to cause more damage to such of precious piece. It seems that the charms rubbing to each other cause the damage.,Neutral
"it was much smaller then it looked, pretty, but small",Neutral
I loved it at first but 5 days later it’s starting to discolor. Not happy.,Neutral
These soaps all smell the same.  I use them but not impressed,Neutral
It looks good and all but the color rose gold is actually pink!,Neutral
Very disappointed in the make of the entire puzzle - it's very thin and cheaply made.,Neutral
It was okay would of been nice if each piece was sealed,Neutral
"I thought the print came with  a frame.  So, I  was disappointed when I  received only the print.",Neutral
Smaller than expected,Neutral
The notepad seems to be well made though it could use some extra glue if it’s important to you the sheets don’t come loose.  I don’t mind that too much. Pretty ink color and the weight of paper is nice. The price is why I chose three stars. I would have been happy to get two pads for this price.,Neutral
I thought they would be a little bigger. Good for mini cupcakes too small for standard cupcakes.,Neutral
"I got this for my 10yr old daughter for Christmas. It’s cute but the engraving is difficult to read and the chain broke after an hour of her wearing it. To be fair, she’s a kid and probably caught it on something.",Neutral
Es bonito de acuerdo al estilo.pero se sale con mucha facilidad de su lugar a pesar de la argollita de cilicona.es una lastima tiene un diseño original.,Neutral
"It's a cute night light, just more aesthetically pleasing than practical. The light is so dim that I have to plug in a second light for my son to sleep with it. Also, if you're not careful unplugging it, the Dinosaur cover pops off every time. It goes well with my son's dinosaur room though.",Neutral
Cute ornament,Neutral
"It literally fit in an 8x10 frame. I should have checked the measurements prior to purchasing bc I definitely wouldn't have spent this amount on an 8x10 print I could have done myself for far cheaper. You win some, you lose some, guess this was my lesson learned.",Neutral
WAY too small. I ordered an x-large cause I like my shirts oversized and it came in an medium/small. I’m a medium but it was tight on me.,Neutral
Wow- it certainly was a minimal amount of writing space for the money. A note card?  And you can barely see the print or lines.,Neutral
cute delicate hoop. difficult to put in. i couldn't get it in and my ear was sore for days from trying,Neutral
This doesn’t fit on the position shown in the ad (next to the track pad on MacBook). Will have to be placed elsewhere.,Neutral
Thanks!,Neutral
Love it but wish it was a lil bigger,Neutral
Is very cute however pens slide out a lot...more for show than use.,Neutral
Wish they had a larger size.,Neutral
Looked much bigger & better online than in person.  Just didn't fit my needs.,Neutral
I was aware of the posters size but in the pictures it looks a lot bigger. I was disappointed in the size,Neutral
"Its honestly a nice wall decor, the craftsmanship is superb BUT this is not what I ordered. The border pictured is distressed and that is not what I received. I had to spray paint the border grey to my liking.",Neutral
Super thin - expected it to be a bit more substantial.,Neutral
Nice looking wallet.... somewhat limited in storage for cards & ID... I would not buy again.,Neutral
"Like this but disappointed that its not made from tiles. Sadly, its just a sticker.",Neutral
"Not spectacular, but all right.",Neutral
"Feels good after a shave, great scent but it disappears quickly.",Neutral
Will be returning as it is not 12oz or even close. It next to an actual 12 oz container this is maybe half 6 oz being generous not worth $20 description needs to be updated! So disappointed smells good but this would last me a week at best!,Neutral
That it did not come with a frame.,Neutral
The birthstones are hot glued or superglued on top... honestly I thought they were embedded. Not sure this is worth the 21 dollars.,Neutral
"The crystal is gorgeous, seriously so! Love the addition of the amethyst and initially it’s just so beautiful with the strands and if anything I expected the crystals blade to break before the strands started coming loose! I can of course put the pendant on another chain but that wasn’t the point in the purchase.",Neutral
"I love the idea of this dainty little necklace... a simple cord with a beautiful stone and sterling extender. It is easy to take off and put on. It's very lightweight, which I love. But it seems overpriced for close to $40 at the time of this review. And the fleshy color of the stone doesn't look very nice with my own lighter skin tone at all. If it were a different stone it would be a better match for me, but still seems somewhat overpriced in my opinion. I love the idea and the sentiment though. But I don't necessarily recommend this color stone (with my skin tone) for this price.",Neutral
Looks like stickers on plastic. Kinda cheap looking but everyone seems to love it.,Neutral
"The earrings were nice, but they literally fell off my teenage daughter's ears, into the grass.",Neutral
Very small,Neutral
Pretty but hurt my ears. I wear them now and make sure I take them off before going to sleep.,Neutral
"Very nice but I give it only 3 stars for the product quality is poor, it almost broke when I was installing it",Neutral
It did not diffuse as well as other ornament diffusers I have had in the past,Neutral
"I bought this for our granddaughter who is cheer crazy, we liked the cost and understand you get what you pay for regarding $40 vs others at $100. The issue is when my son received it being in the graphics business he noticed an issue with the vinyl decal. Whoever placed the decal on must of lifted the decal off again before pressing it down creating the ripples / scratch etc. If you look at the photo you will see 2 areas above the M & below the A. It figures I sent this item to someone who  does vinyl & screen printing for a living lol. (Yes I could've just had him make a bag, I was trying to surprise her)",Neutral
Very late! This is unique key ring but way too expensive for me but I like it ok.,Neutral
"This was very cute! But the plastic is came on was heavy and far to thick to have on a badge it would pull your shirt down, super cute concept but needs to be on thinner plastic for it to be wearable",Neutral
Cute but feels like it chokes me,Neutral
"These bracelets are cute and I love the design of them, however, I had expected them to be bigger than they were. They're VERY thin in width, which is fine for a woman, if that's what you like, but I got them for my boyfriend and it just looks a bit odd on his wrist, especially with only one. It looks better when you combine more, but still, not what I was expecting. When I first opened them, I thought maybe it was a child's version of the bracelet because it didn't look like it would even fit my wrist. It did fit, but the handwoven part of the bracelet barely went around my wrist. On a man, this design covers the front of their wrist, and the string with the slipknot covers most of the back. Again, I love the look of these bracelets, I just wish they were a bit bigger in width.",Neutral
After I played with it it became very foggy not stretchy either but fun to play with,Neutral
great reminder-my fingers turning black a little though. haven't wore it for a few days,Neutral
"I really liked the idea of this artwork, but unfortunately picture is grainy.  The paper quality is good and may look fine from a distance, but I was disappointed in the picture quality.",Neutral
Fine for a kids party,Neutral
"I like the look, but I cleaned the window and installed as directed and there is still a section of the sticker that wouldn't stick.",Neutral
Too heavy,Neutral
"This is such an adorable idea, I love the concept, but the execution was off. The image was pixelated and the colors were too light and bright. It served its purpose fine, but the quality wasn't what I had expected.",Neutral
Expected a thicker laminate. Bends wrinkle too easily. Top border was crooked. Looks like it was cut by hand.,Neutral
Nove design but quality of bag was too thin.,Neutral
"Was looking for something shiny to frame for my bedroom/bathroom. I did really like what this said, because the statement is so true!! That being said I thought it would be a little more sparkly/shiny. It comes in gold also, and that appears to look more shiny on my computer, but doesn't go with my decor.  I've ordered a silver mat to put around it, and may bling it out with some little rhinestones, so hopefully with a little ""tweeking"" it will look better. I thought it was kinda pricey for just a piece of card stock.",Neutral
It was nice when i received and them gave it to my mom for Christmas and she loved it but now it has turned colors.  Very disappointed now.,Neutral
"Beautiful and I like it, however, for the price, it should come with hardware. Not that big of a deal but it would be a nice touch for the total price to be worth it. It would also be smart if the maker made the hanging holes 16in apart, to be able to put in into studs.",Neutral
"Great for the price, shipped pretty fast but they added a parenthesis symbol randomly on on of the necklaces, looks pretty bobo",Neutral
Kool,Neutral
"It was not as sparkly as it appeared in the picture. Other than that, it looks good. It is easy to put on, and has stayed on through hand washes.",Neutral
It was the only thing I could find with this saying but it was pretty cheaply made. I had to take off excess glue.,Neutral
"They are cute pictures, but not what I was expecting.  I don't think they are worth the money I paid for them.",Neutral
"Really pretty bracelet.  My friend loved it, but the clasp broke in a week",Neutral
Beautiful rose 🌹<br />The clips were unevenly spased though... Something maybe went wrong in assembly?,Neutral
Beautiful but got caught in customs.  Seller refunded - offered to ship another but I passed.,Neutral
I could have did this myself ...It's a a iron on..,Neutral
Kind of thin.  Seen others that are much thinker.,Neutral
Smaller than expected. Would have been better if frame was included.,Neutral
Wished the clasp would have been durable… it was a gift… and a bit embarrassed it didn’t last longer.,Neutral
I ordered 4 rings as Christmas gifts and I just looked at them today. They are poorly made and 2 of them you can barely read the state name and one of those has a big nick in the edge near the name. I’m ashamed to give these as gifts now. I would appreciate an exchange or refund.,Neutral
"I was so excited when i found this, had been looking for something like this for a while. However when i received although had to was beautiful and as pictured, the coil on it made it impossible to wear. The coil on the upper part of pod snagged on everything and by the end of the second week i had literally had t it so many times the could was no longer formed correctly. It is a beautiful design but that feature is absolutely disappointing.",Neutral
"I love the concept of a pi necklace.  The description does state that the numbers are PRINTED on some kind of paper.  But, the image looks more like the numbers are engraved into the metal disc itself. It is easy to be confused.  The chain is very short. No length is given in the description.",Neutral
It’s a cute nose ring but it started to irritate my nose after a couple of days.,Neutral
"I have to say the actual flower decals are gorgeous and look so luxurious. I’ve used premium decals from a very expensive site before and these are just a good a quality in terms of the look. The only reason I gave these 3 stars is because the adhesive was terrible. I installed them one afternoon and by the following morning they had all peeled off, rolling into themselves to the point where they couldn’t be reinstalled. I ended up using decals I had planned on using for another room and I stalled them using spray adhesive and they seemed to do the trick. Overall I would still recommend them because the look is beautiful and the quality is great, I would just recommend taking the extra step to use spray adhesive in order to secure them.",Neutral
"Package was in a resealable bag but the top above the zip-lock was not heat sealed. It was put into an Amazon bag so in shipment the product got out and into the Amazon bag. None of the product went to waste, we were able to use it out of the Amazon bag straight into the bath. However, moisture got into the Amazon bag/product bag and we did not have any fizzy with the salt. The fragrance was still there, it was nice and pleasant smelling. Suggest the packaging be more study like this bottle we had to put it in. There are moisture chunks in the salt and that is okay. The price would be okay if the package was better. An average of 4-5 baths could be taken before running out of product.",Neutral
Nicely made but we still have no clue how to put this together no instructions and can't understand the one in the box.,Neutral
Loved the fast shipping! The script I chose is very delicate.  If I could do it again. I would choose a different script.  My grandson's name is Dallas Jaxon. The script looks like Jaxoy<br />I won't use this piece. Overall.  I would purchase again.  Great packaging,Neutral
Very nice heavy leather. It has no closing clasps.,Neutral
"once framed its nice however- its words, printed on photopaper. I though it was something different, that's all.",Neutral
"I purchased this as a gift for myself, with the hopes of later purchasing it as a surprise for someone else. It arrived with nice presentation in a box and the kaleidoscope feature is present. My only complaint is that the gold material that it is made out of is thin and cheap in appearance.",Neutral
These ratings are nice. However they are quite easy to bend and mess up. Also they fall out of ear sometimes. They are nice overall though,Neutral
"Well, the necklace is beautiful, and just the right size.  However, I feel no energy from it.  I've worn all different talismans over the years and felt the energy within them immediately.  I feel nothing from this pendant.  Its been about two months now.  Maybe the stones are not real.<br />I decided to keep the necklace anyway because its a nice accessory to my wardrobe.",Neutral
"the idea is cute, it looked larger in the picture, I should've looked at the dimensions. Its pretty small",Neutral
"Although the bracelet is good quality, the shape of the glass is totally different than the picture and not a shape I would’ve purchased had I known that it looked totally different. It’s also quite a bit smaller.  My piece looked like a “bone”...rectangle with rounded edges that stood out from the sides. I understand it’s sea glass, and shapes are different , I just think if the difference to the picture is going to be so great , it should be shown as possibilities ...one of the pictures should be of  the different shapes it could possibly be...not just prettiest piece you have. My daughter (it was a birthday present) was not thrilled with the piece although she loves sea glass.. but she loved the original bracelet in the picture.  The item DID come in a BEAUTIFUL box and wrapping though.",Neutral
Haven't had it a month and it already had 3 holes In the neck of the T-shirt.,Neutral
Bigger than expected. Wish they were smaller,Neutral
The earrings need a stud to keep them on  so you do not loose them.,Neutral
Really cute just yarn gets snugged now and then bc of one of the little connecting rings. Keeping bc I might use for something else! Lol,Neutral
It’s very small even with the frame I picked out for it’s small,Neutral
"Claims handmade. Graphic is a sticker applied to a tin. It shipped in an envelope, so one corner was dented. I can't/won't use this for a gift, but it's still quite serviceable for holding yarn needles in my knitting bag.",Neutral
Exactly as describer how ever for the price could have been better made then a packaging tube with some rings to attach it,Neutral
"The smell of the Palo Santo was really nice when it first arrived, of course after some time it does lose a bit everyday though. The packaging was nice and the letter that came with it as well.<br />My main complaint is the metal piece, it has been turning my skin into green without water touching it, no sweat either. I'm very careful not to ruin jewelry especially wooden ones.. if Creator had used Stainless Steel, this wouldn't be an issue. I did buy this and another a gift but wouldn't do it again..",Neutral
"lovey earrings ads states green color but they are blue disappointing, but I will keep",Neutral
it should come with a dry erase marker (overlooked that it didn't come with it),Neutral
"The quality of the shirt and the printing of graphics are top-notch. The only thing keeping this from being rated 5-stars is the color of the shirt was wrong. I ordered olive green and the shirt I received was a kind of charcoal or asphalt gray color -- which is puzzling because they aren't even options color-wise.<br />I wanted green to match the colors the Orphans wear, but the shirt I received isn't any shade of green I've ever seen. I'm disappointed, but returns are too much of a hassle, so I'll leave this review instead.",Neutral
This is lighter than it looks online and much smaller!!,Neutral
Broke before we got to use it,Neutral
Smaller than I thought. I'll give them to my neice.,Neutral
"Kind of ""MEH"" and underwhelming for the price.",Neutral
Right color,Neutral
Awkward fit where sides join the top.  Kinda boxey.,Neutral
"Ordered 2 ""bobbleheads"" of my daughter and son in law. Given that it must be a difficult undertaking to transform a photo to a figurine, I was pleased with outcome of my SIL, but my daughters? Well, it is female.<br /><br />  Submitted several photos of both, and they pretty much nailed the one on first try, but my daughters, even after a couple of back and forth e=mails to try and convey what I wanted in order to make it look like her, seems they were done and had fired the head already, and that was it. They shipped it without final approval, unlike what they claim.<br /><br />Overall, a 50/50 success.  They are pretty cool, but only 1 of the 2 are ""bobbles"". At $150 a pop, would have been good to have a better final product.",Neutral
Not as big as I would have liked. It says stay out of the woods instead of stay out of the forest,Neutral
For the price I was expecting the arrows to be made with thicker paper.  Still super cute though and looks great on the table.  FYI glitter is only on one side so you have to put them down one by one if you want the glitter side up.,Neutral
"Beautiful but it broke in half while I was wearing it! Not sure how, but now it’s garbage.",Neutral
"They guarantee their products, money is well invested, they offer solutions if you have some doubts and concerns",Neutral
"They look good, but they hurt my feet. There is no padding in the soles at all so it’s like walking barefoot. And they scratched my heels pretty badly! I had to put bandaids on my heels after only 5 minutes of wearing them, before I even left the house. But that didn’t matter it was already too late. Both heels had huge blisters. I couldn’t even put them back on for 2 weeks. I still like the way they look though, so I wear them sometimes when I know I won’t be walking or standing for long but I put clear bandaids on the spots where I got blisters before and try to walk slowly so they don’t come off exposing my skin to the shoes and the possibility of getting blisters or cuts again. I wish they were a little better quality because they are super cute and I get lots of compliments on how they look, I just can’t recommend them to anyone because they are so uncomfortable.",Neutral
Very difficult to get perfect on the wall. Had real problems with bubbles and wrinkles.,Neutral
They did not stay in place for me. They also fell out easily so I lost one pretty quickly,Neutral
"Pretty good for the most part but the top has trouble staying on the lid. It is not snug enough. When you open the case, the little hinge pieces of the cover end up pushing it off the lid.",Neutral
"It does not look like the pictures of it at all. No sparkle. Which Is why I bought a sunstone, for the sparkle.<br />The cord is amazing and beautiful. Just wish the stone was as pretty as the cord.",Neutral
The hour and minute hands and the coloring of the clock are very different than what is pictured. I’m pretty disappointed. Hope my husband likes it! It’s my gift for him to celebrate ten years of marriage!,Neutral
Too small,Neutral
Nice color.  When you take a picture of your client holding the key you can not make out your name.  I rec'd my sign promptly but there was a crease on one side making it look cheap.,Neutral
"The front plastic is cloudy and dirty. The backing with Maleficent has lots of air bubbles.  I was excited to get it, but then disappointed when I saw them.",Neutral
"Very pretty necklace, but smaller than I was anticipating which is of course my fault for not looking closer at the measurements.  Quality product though",Neutral
"The cupcake stand is OK, but it is not &#34;tiered&#34; as shown in the picture. The picture makes it seem the lowest tier is quite a bit bigger than the top tier. On the one I received, they are almost the same size. Since our wedding is so close, there wasn't time to find anything else, so we kept it.",Neutral
very small like printed on a home printer. But quality is like a holograph and looks good.,Neutral
It's pretty but was broken when I got it. Thankfully I have own tools to fix it. A bit pricey.,Neutral
Like the product good weight jewel in middle came broken and cracked,Neutral
"I don't recall seeing the note in the listing about sharp edges when I purchased this or I wouldn't have done so. I am disappointed with the quality of the metal. It's super thin, not at all what I was expecting, and I am uncomfortable giving this to the kids I had them made for. They came correctly spelled and cut, but I am very disappointed.",Neutral
Really cute sweatshirt I got for Mother’s Day. The material isn’t very soft and comfy . Also runs so small,Neutral
It didn't work for me but it was an ok product.,Neutral
"Not worth the price, guess you pay for the idea.",Neutral
"Necklace is pretty, but it has a spring ring clasp, not a lobster claw clasp as indicated on description.",Neutral
"I really liked this piece and wore it quite a bit.  The wing is made well you can tell.  Unfortunately, the chain clasp broke within the first week.",Neutral
Kind of overpriced for 3 photos. Quality is good but they literally are photos—have photo processing info on back.,Neutral
I loved this ring so much. My post office sent it back and I never got it. So disappointed. Please let me know if I can get one again,Neutral
"I love the style, just are a pain to put in.",Neutral
"The earrings were described at 1.5"" but I measured from the top of the fishhook to the ball at the bottom and barely got 1 1/4"". The beads are 5/16 "" at widest part.<br />I will keep them because the color is good and the findings are nicely done. They also match the color of some other jewelry I have. They're cute but don't dangle as much as I prefer.",Neutral
The name farmhouse books I received were ok. I was not impressed. I would not order them as a gift again or for myself.,Neutral
No frame which I wasn’t expecting,Neutral
"I purchased 2 of these cute necklaces for my 9 year old twin granddaughters.  They are incredibly cute and they absolutely loved them; however,  after only one wearing, the initial on both necklaces fell off.  I know the price was great, but just a little work on the stability of the necklace would be nice.  Unfortunately, I will not purchase these again for my other 8 granddaughters since they are so cheaply made.  Disappointed Nanny....",Neutral
"I love the design, but I wish an XSmall was offered as the small is much bigger than I thought it would be.",Neutral
"I loved the Amazon photo for this print and that’s why I decided to order it. When I got it, the image is kinda dark and the red glasses don’t standout as in the Amazon photo. Also it being printed on a dictionary page, when I received it the first thing I noticed was the illustration on the dictionary page was showing up at the cats mouth and it looks weird.",Neutral
"I've waited a couple of weeks to cool down after purchasing this sign before making comment!  When I ordered this, the color appeared to be white with black lettering, but when it arrived it was pale blue w/black lettering.  The wall I have it displayed on is a light gray, so it just doesn't go well.  It also has white marks that appear to be the base color prior to the blue in wear marks around the edges.  When I corresponded with them about it, they explained that the color is pale blue and the white scratching or rubs around the edge are for character.  I guess if you wanted to put it in a frame, the edges might not show.  The sign material and printing are fantastic, but the color is not what was expected and the customer support isn't very good!  So, beware and warned that if you want white background, you need to order from another company!",Neutral
"The leaves are a little more 'fake' looking than I thought they would be. I put it up above my fireplace and it looks well enough. I thought it would be a suitable substitute for the Magnolia Market wreath, but I was wrong. The box, highly acclaimed in the description (&#34;..securely packaged in a high quality box that can be used for off-season storage for years to come&#34;) cannot be used for storage; the flimsy top was completely crushed in when I received the wreath.<br />Quality of the wreath seems to be pretty good.",Neutral
This is cottonwood based salve not Balm of Gilead. Their is a difference,Neutral
The stones where kinda dull not shining it looks like it needs brighter stones..,Neutral
Top slides off but sturdy plastic and print has not rubbed off,Neutral
"Very cute, my favorite out of all the work stickers Ive come across. They are wide enough to fit on the classic happy planner size, however, this was way to expensive for one sheet of stickers and for that I will not be buying again.",Neutral
It's ok....the print on it looks doubled.,Neutral
The art looks crisper and clearer in pictured. Could be because this is a large color and it has blurred due to the size.,Neutral
"Cute gift, and arrived very fast, although the logo was a bit crooked on the cup. Not too noticeable, but enough that I noticed.",Neutral
Very flimsy,Neutral
The round ring was not secure enough. I do love the cross. Thanks,Neutral
"This product was perfect for what I needed it for....I used the tag for a bracelet charm and got rid of chain.  If I were to wear it for what it intended for, a necklace, I would say it is way too small.",Neutral
Flimsy,Neutral
"The smell, should be improved..",Neutral
I bought two of these. One for my mom and one for myself. One of the bracelets came and the design was very muted and not bright as the photo shows. The second was better but still not the bright blue depicted in the photo. My mom loved her bracelet but she didn't see the photo of what it was supposed to look like,Neutral
"I ordered 2 of these , but was disappointed because the Items I received were half the size of what the picture showed.",Neutral
The burlap is already ripping after only a few months.,Neutral
This is very nice but disappointed that it didn't include dog breed at the bottom as shown.,Neutral

"It is a pretty ring, wife loved it but it cracked in her day to day use with in the first 2 months",Neutral
They are not strong enough to hold my crock.,Neutral

"“Here is your awesome wallpaper, now buy your own glue” is what this company should have said along with this purchase!  The wallpaper itself is amazing.  Highest of quality.  But they messed it all up with this cheap end awful glue mix!  It was extremely difficult to put up as it just doesn’t stick.  Their mixture formula on their instructions must be wrong.  It was so bad<br />That within two hours, the paper just completely peeled off like nothing!  So I purchased REAL glue and put it up correctly!  Now it’s awesome!  This would be FIVE stars if they just didn’t include the glue and said “glue not included”.  So do yourself a favor, buy real wallpaper glue along with this.",Neutral
Definitely not a used horseshoe and looks more like pony shoe…but at least it is a real shoe…with what looks like fake rust sprayed on it,Neutral
Great product! True to size and soft material. The only two downsides are the shirts had a little odor to them and you can see the outline of the press.,Neutral
Like the socks...but my big toes went though after a few wearings,Neutral
Kinda small but nice,Neutral
"very cute although a little smaller and a bit more delicate than i anticipated...a bit more ""bendy"" than i would like",Neutral
"I like the earrings overall, they are nice. However, the jade is not as pictured. The color of the “jade” is a yellowish champagne color.",Neutral
Looks bigger in the picture; but it’s beautiful,Neutral
"The font is a lot smaller on the shirt than it appears in the picture. The shirt itself is decent quality, but the picture is a bit deceptive.",Neutral
It’s a sharp little case but I wouldn’t recommend it! I change my cases every couple of days so they don’t get worn looking but this one didn’t hold up at all. My name is falling off all ready & I have only used it twice for a few days at a time. I’m really disappointed.,Neutral
Came scratched and also didn’t have the writing I wanted added to it. Not worth the 35 dollars,Neutral
There is no way in hell a wooden winder for kite string cost this much!  The price has to be a mistake!,Neutral
For the price it's just a sticker. They do say this in the description which I didn't read so my bad.,Neutral
"Smells good and i like the idea! Its got the same scents that soarin' does, but it doesnt really smell like it. Still really smells good though!",Neutral
I brought it puja. Decent cloth but the material is stiff. Do not know if its good for stitching.<br />The colors are good.<br />Wish there was an option to buy 2 or 3 pieces instead of 5.,Neutral
"It’s extremely tiny & flimsy. not a bad product necessarily, just not worth $65 at allll. not even close.",Neutral
"Great decal. came in a timely manner, just thought it would be wider, only about an inch in height which makes it kind of hard to read once its on the truck.",Neutral
Cute- quality just ok,Neutral
Much smaller than I expected. They were cute for the birthday party though.,Neutral
"They do an alright job but aren't overly absorptive. You get two of each color and they're quite nice to look at. They clean easily enough, which is nice since we've found they're much more useful for scrubbing than drying. I like their small, compact size, which complements the size of my kitchen. You might not need other towels with these around, but I don't recommend leaning on them as paper towels (for example, not great at cleaning glass).",Neutral
I love this bracelet but it runs small...I have a fairly small wrist and cannot wear it,Neutral
Thought it would be much bigger. Not sure they even make a size as big as the one they show in the photo.,Neutral
"Pros: appears well made , arrived quickly, very cute!<br />Cons: seller forgot to add the heart symbol I selected and the chain is so long, I will have to cut a few inches off if it.<br /><br />Overall would recommend.",Neutral
"Pattern is def cute, but just FYI, its a sticker over a regular white plate. And mine didnt come with screws like it says.",Neutral
This is cute but the black ink is coming off of my name on it. Have only had a month.,Neutral
No history associated with my wife birthday,Neutral
"Its nice but the name printed was so plain, it would have looked nicer if it was bigger and written in cursive",Neutral
Love the necklace;) Very pretty and great fit. It needs to be saldered at the clasp because it came off when I put it on but I bent it back.,Neutral
It's pretty nice for an image printed on photo paper but really shouldn't cost more than $5.00 for that reason.  If it was printed onto cardstock or something a little thicker it would be worth what I paid.  Would also be more attractive as a metal or canvas sign.  I REALLY need to read the fine print/description better before ordering from Amazon.  Too many times items have arrived smaller than I realized or made out of a material I wasn't expecting.,Neutral
It will look very nice once I frame it.,Neutral
"Was expecting paper, not plastic",Neutral
"It was just okay. Not much I can say about a card with ""Happy Birthday"" printed on it. Could have picked one up at Walmart.",Neutral
"indeed this AirTag holder in a card format is lightweight. an AirTag securely snaps into the circular opening in the middle of this white holder and it does not seem like the AirTag would fall out easily...this is good!<br /><br />the holder is about credit card size in dimension and about the thickness of 3 credit cards stacked together. but I wouldn't consider this as ""ultra thin"". with the AirTag installed, expect at least the thickness to be much more (as much as a stack of 8-9 credits cards) in my opinion.<br /><br />the problem I had with this is the material and quality. the description says this is made of PVC. PVC can have various densities, allowing for some flexibility depending on the formula used. this holder feels ""spongey"" for lack of better description, as if it was made of some sort of foam. I did not bother to depress it sharply or fold it to test the limits of its durability, but the holder is slightly flexible.<br /><br />the finish is matte on all surfaces. quality-wise, it does not project a luxury item appearance or something ""Apple"" would carry as an accessory in their stores. the manufacturer could have done better, like ever so slightly rounding out the edges for softer tactile feel and less of a stamped out one.<br /><br />in the end, I returned this because for the price it wasn't worth worth it. $9.99 for something that feels a quarter of this price at best.",Neutral
"Order came quickly, but disappointment that the top right corner is already bent and all of the pages are crimped before I even got to start using the journal. I had a hard time deciding on a journal. I like what is on the pages, but I may wish it had more room to write details and reflections on the trip. None of them seemed to be perfect but will give this a try.",Neutral
"This mermaid name decal is super cute, however the photo is a bit misleading. I customized as prompted, but did not see where I could change the size. I believed I was getting was was pictured. This is very small and I could have saved myself money by using my own Cricut and a 24” cutting mat. I ordered this thinking it would be as large as other decals I have for my other daughters- which are the same size as their advertised pictures.<br /><br />Read the description very carefully, otherwise you’ll be disappointed thinking you’re ordering a decal large enough to be a focal point above the bed.<br /><br />Quality is good. Product is good, too. The listing and item received is misleading and small. I ordered a different decal from the company I purchased two other decals from. I’ll use this one somewhere else for my daughter.<br /><br />*Picture with easy-up package to show size comparison.",Neutral
"Mediocre. Product doesn't fit as advertised and is 2"" short on both sides of the car which is frustrating to look at. Install is simple but you need to let the vinyl sit flat for a day or two under some books or it will wrinkle when applying. The vinyl is pretty low quality and will crack before it tears or stretches. I would reccomend measuring your window carefully before ordering and having someone who knows what they're doing install it. Disappointed but I cant complain too much their customer service is excellent and were fast to replace one of the decals that was faulty.",Neutral
looking good but its too small,Neutral
Expensive for the size it is.  Pretty but much smaller than I was expecting.,Neutral
Print was not hd,Neutral
I believed it was larger. Very small,Neutral
I only wish the family tree prop had been horizontal instead of the vertical format. It's cumbersome to hold while taking photo. I also wish the color of the font had been a brighter color.  I guess you live and learn plus I had to have it mounted on poster board which added more cost to what I already paid.,Neutral
"The silver is quite dark, I expected a better quality silver",Neutral
"I really like them, but they are VERY expensive for the quantity!",Neutral

Very nice but ad shows a much darker pink. Look white in person,Neutral
ok smaller than expected,Neutral
I am super bummed because I really love this shirt but it’s to small. I have ordered this brand before and I usually wear a medium but this one seems like it’s mislabeled. Fits like a small but I need a medium. I have other shirts that fit true to size in this brand so I wasn’t expecting this. Disappointed but It’s super cute! Size up,Neutral
"My fiancé has long locked hair. We were looking for hoops so they wouldn’t get caught in his hair. Unfortunately just days after he put them in, one was already missing from getting caught in his hair. Super disappointing.",Neutral
Smaller than expected,Neutral
I wanted to love this towel but the print on it is not vivid and it’s kind of hard to see the cute detail. The towel is smaller but that’s fine. I was using it to put into a Christmas gift. I feared the receiver thought it was a cheap $5 gift but it cost $15. I believe I got free shipping so of course that has to be factored in.,Neutral
Based on the image I thought this would be framed.,Neutral
"Great shirt, but the hem came out with the first wash",Neutral
"Our cats initially went WILD for these, but lost interest in them after the first day. There's no way to add new catnip to them, which would make them better and keep our kitty's interests.",Neutral
"Bought these as a gift. They came poorly protected with pretty severe wrinkles. They also came with zero instructions and so I had to send her the link to where I purchased from, so she knew how much I spent on her wrinkled gift. Overall, I would not purchase again.",Neutral
I loved the quality of the product but found it hard to hang and get it to stay up outside in the winter weather,Neutral
Looks like it is pictured except my  stones appear darker not as bright as pictured.  But overall happy with it. I really like the way it fastens with the sliding bead.,Neutral
"I ordered this to make foot soaks for my business. The tea is nice and smells lovely, but packaging was horrible. The stopper lid was out of the bottle and tea was all over the bottom of the box. There was no shrink wrap or anything to seal the lid to the bottle, so it must have popped open during shipping. I ship products all the time for my business and could never imagine sending a product packaged this way to a customer. It looks like they've never had to ship items before and had no idea what they were doing. Very disappointing.",Neutral
I thought that was a set,Neutral
"Bought this for my husband as he has a beard & plays Santa. He’s tried to wear it, but really has a hard time breathing with it on. It fits well, just can’t breathe.",Neutral
"Even though the description says it is a ""medium"", it is still very small.  I have small to medium dogs so I usually have toys on the smaller side, but this was a lot smaller than I expected.  My dogs loved it though, but due to its size, it did not last very long.",Neutral
"I love the table; it's made very well, the instructions are dead-simple, there are pencil marks to lie up everything to, and it's nice looking to. My main issue is that the tabletop came severely dented. I was hoping to stain the table, but given how much filler I've had to apply, I'll need to paint the table now. Wish it would have had a bit better packaging along the edges.",Neutral
Too small,Neutral

size on the small side,Neutral
Adjusted it to fit my toe.  It came off the first time I left the house and I lost it.  But it was cute while it was on.,Neutral

NA,Neutral
"Looks like it was rushed, it’s ok. Won’t buy again",Neutral
"Very pretty design, but when I got ready to try them on the color had changed! No longer lavender, but murky clear. I don’t know what caused this, as they were still in the box.",Neutral
So I wanted this shirt so badly and loved I could choose colors. I am a clear medium in all shirts. This shirt is huge! Definitely not true to size and now I can't wear it for my trip. Very sad.,Neutral
"While the print is fine, the image is much smaller than the pictures made it look. It's also not 8X10. It's more like 8X10.5 and it's not centered, which made it difficult to find a frame. I wound up using an 8X10 frame and just folding the bottom over slightly so it would fit. I also did not realize it would not come with a frame, although that's mostly my fault for not reading the whole item name, because all of the pictures show it already in a frame.",Neutral
"These are printed on glossy paper, which surprised me. The quality up close isn't the best, but I'll still be hanging them over our bed for now, since from a few feet away you can't really tell.",Neutral
Bought this for my friend's 40th birthday.,Neutral
Wife loved them,Neutral
"I'm surprised how much I can say about this. On the one hand, it's a big ol Keychain. On the other it actually fits in my pocket nicely. I was hoping it would be made of wood, but it's plastic. Yet it probably should be made of plastic in order to have any durability. It looks very nice, a fun conversation starter.<br /><br />Eh, I don't know. Perhaps it's a little more expensive than it should be. But if I were to make one myself it would probably cost more than this.<br /><br />It's a Parabox! I simultaneously recommend and don't recommend it.",Neutral

thank you,Neutral
"this is a very unique, eye catching adornment but only if you can hold onto it. It just sits on the ear, and the first day I owned it, I lost it, found it and then lost it again. It is weightless so you won't know it is gone until you happen to check for it and it isn't there.",Neutral
They broke the first time I wore them,Neutral
Wasn’t girly or anything but wasn’t as detailed either. Definitely not a smell of ammo therapy..... LoL,Neutral
I’ve had  this Bracelets a week now It has started to unravel (not good) the look and feel good I can’t get this bracelet to  remain Tight I wanted to keep. I will ask for a replacement to see that one does  the same… I’ll keep you  posted,Neutral
These are so best but so so heavy oh my heck I can’t wear them it weighs so much my earlobes look like they will rip beautiful earings but oh so heavy,Neutral
Pretty necklace. Right length but the jade circle is very small.,Neutral
Very detailed sterling silver clarinet charm.  The chain leaves a lot to be desired so I suggest buying a better one as the slighted pull will snap it.,Neutral
"Doesn't come with the frame, and is a little smaller than I expected but it's okay. The picture makes it look bigger than it is. But I put mine in a floating frame and it made it look much bigger. The coloring is very nice though and it is not flimsy.",Neutral
Overpriced,Neutral
Very small and color looks not so good. I am not sure if it is pure leather either.,Neutral
My print has a crease at the top & bottom due to it being bent. The inner package had a do not fold stamp on it. The bigger envelope did not. I can still use it with the creases just not in the best condition.,Neutral
I ordered two sets of the same size and when I received the earrings they weren’t the same size. Cute but disappointed.,Neutral
"I thought the soap was cute, too bad it wasn't just a bit larger",Neutral
Its nice but a whole lot smaller than you expect.,Neutral
"I didn’t know it was just one piece.<br />One piece for $9. That’s ridiculous. I would’ve NEVER bought this if I had read the description. My fault. Just assumed when a description says accessories, it’s the plural form of accessory, which usually means multiple of an item. Buyers, please pay attention before y’all buy!!!!",Neutral
I like the pictures but I thought it was coming already matted and ready to hang like the pictures on Amazon. I think from that perspective it was false advertisement. I have to pay an additional 35.00 per picture to get them matted,Neutral
"I purchased 2 of the Large versions with my address & arrow on them. I cleaned my mailbox on both sides with the same item and let it dry. I followed the instructions-it wasn't hard and the Large was the perfect size for what I needed. The first one went on super easy and looks great. The second one was very difficult. The vinyl lettering wouldn't come off the sheet. Then I couldn't get it to stay on the mailbox and the lettering ripped. I even used a special Cricut tool to smooth it on & still it didn't work. I know this happens when using vinyl sometimes, but still I was very disappointed. The one that worked looks fantastic.",Neutral
The quality of the key chain isn't bad but the letters are very small.  Almost hard to even see.  My daughter has a unique name and have to order everything customized for her.  I would've preferred the letters to take up more space and be more noticeable.,Neutral
"The photo itself was not cropped so there was some extra stuff around the edges. Also, I thought the small words would be from his speeches or something- it’s a DICTIONARY PAGE from the letter “P”, seriously. Not even the letters M, L or K…",Neutral
This scroll is pretty but came in bent.  We were going to put it on the new hood over the stove.  Our contractor did it and he never did get it totally flat.  We did use it but if you get close to it you would see it is not flat.  It is really smaller than we expected although the measurements were there for us to see.  I really do not recommend this product.,Neutral
"Received my two rings yesterday (one silver and one rose gold). The quality seems to be good and so far the black has not worn off from hand washing, though it's only been 24hours.

It’s ok for price and size,Neutral
Not made very well. It feels like it will fall apart easily.,Neutral
it's okay. not as I expected,Neutral
"In the picture provided it shows the ribbon already tied into a bow, but they are already cut and not tied.  I also felt they were expensive.  I do appreciate the seller was accommodating when I needed to change the date of the wedding",Neutral
A bit crooked on paper.,Neutral
Doesn’t cover under the chin or over the nose real well. May work better for a child,Neutral
"These were perfect for mini champagne bottles, they fit right over the existing label so we didn’t have to take the originals off . I’m only giving them 3 stars because I only received 10 out of the 20 labels. We needed 16 total and some bottles had to go without a more personalized label, super bummed!",Neutral
"I love these earrings, they are really cute. I only wore them once and one earring broke and fell off the hook, and I wasn't able to find it to send it back in for a replacement. I wish the earring was more durable.",Neutral
"The description told that you could customize the length of the chain, and that did not follow through. Asked for a longer chain, and it did not materialize. I like the necklace very much, but for me it would be more comfortable on a longer chain",Neutral
I like that I can have my ignition key in a key chain again but the stiff bulky ends on the part with the key hole makes it hard to push into the ignition and turn. Maybe with extended use it will loosen up.,Neutral
"These are really pretty earrings, but like others have said they are really small. I feel like they are more suitable to young girls. They are comfortable and lightweight to wear. But I decided to return for another pair that is a better size for my needs.",Neutral
"Cute graphics, very cheap material.",Neutral
"Well, it was pretty when it arrived, but as I went to set up a care package for my sister-in-law for Mother's Day/her birthday, this was how it looked upon inspection before boxing. Pretty upset!! We're having to hot glue it :(",Neutral
I was under the impression that the frame came with the sign however the sign itself is nice.,Neutral
Very disappointed when I received. It was much smaller than I imagined. It was more of a gag gift for a dragon lover. He did love it but I felt for the money the adoption paper and item was cheap.,Neutral
Love love love however the text was not aligned centered on paper,Neutral
It's a cute gift. Very small but looks nice with the right plant,Neutral
Will be returning as it is not 12oz or even close. It next to an actual 12 oz container this is maybe half 6 oz being generous not worth $20 description needs to be updated! So disappointed smells good but this would last me a week at best!,Neutral
Very cute prints,Neutral
"They messed up the digit and changed the 9 to a g. The name tag fell off his harness within a month of use. They also sent another person’s order to my place, which I sent to the person who was originally meant to receive it.",Neutral
I am still going to install it in my room to complete  my switches,Neutral
Didn’t really care for the look of it!,Neutral
These were lovely items! They were just as described - I ordered 2 batches (3 pumpkins in each order - so 6 in total). All of the pumpkins were delivered in ONE small box - for which I payed $14.00 dollars shipping!!!!! Yep! It shamelessly stated on the invoice that I payed shipping for BOTH orders which were delivered in ONE shipping box. I put the box with the pumpkins in it on my kitchen scales and it did not even weigh 2 lbs!!!!! Not good business ethics! So while the product was beautiful - I will never deal with this seller again!,Neutral
They are cute. Smaller than I thought they would be. About an inch and a half  diameter.<br /><br /> I think they’re too pricey for the quality and overall appearance.,Neutral
"I ordered this slime off their main account and it at first was super stretchy and the pearls didnt fall out, after only having this slime for not even two months it started to change colors into a moldy green color, I ended up throwing the slime away!",Neutral
Wonderful design. Smaller and not as sturdy than I expected.,Neutral
Thought this was super cute but it did not stick as applied on the instructions.  I literally had to peel each letter/word off and apply to my wall. Definitely a headache.,Neutral
This is such a nice idea but the product is low quality. The stones are plastic and the color is not quite right.,Neutral
"It was a little chipped and the glass isn't super clear: It looks kind of foggy. But, hey, I don't know where else to get this design!",Neutral
I am just really upset that my E looks exactly like an R on “Becca” and for the price a paid I just expected it to look as the letters should! It looks like it says “brcca”,Neutral
"The slippers looked beautiful and the monogram was well done. However, the quality of the slipper itself is very cheap. The bottom part is very thin and hurt your feet after using due to zero foot support.",Neutral
No separation of transfer tape from decal<br />Used razor blade to reconstruct decal<br />3 stars because it is a beautiful Scandinavian mythology design and hard subject (ravens) to<br />find,Neutral
They definitely turn,Neutral
Sheds really bad… the shipping was as much ad yhe matt. I would not buy again.,Neutral
it's not too colorful as expected...,Neutral
Ok,Neutral
Insert did not work so well!,Neutral
"The fragrance did not last very long, packaging was beautiful",Neutral
I got the ring. It looks exactly like the picture.  Very wonderful.  Although I got the wrong size.<br />But in short I decided to make it a gift to someone else. So it didn't go to waste.,Neutral
I liked the product but I strongly disliked getting a 20% email from the company offering 20% off only to find out that my order of $38.00 did not qualify,Neutral
The elephant part are fine the back piece that holds the earrings on turns black pretty quickly.<br /><br />Also the earrings are a bit bigger than expected.,Neutral
I liked the color was real bright and the lettering was clean.  Overall satisfied.  Only recommendation get poster already framed I struggled to set up or to find something big enough to fit in.,Neutral
The pendant itself is beautiful but the chain is absolutely horrible and looks like it came out of a 25 cent machine. Replaced the chain myself and it looked 100 percent better,Neutral
Runs small but cute shirt,Neutral
Disappointed by the chain. Supposed to be an 18 inch chain. Only 16 inch.,Neutral
"Upun arriving, I was excited because they added a special lemon dump cake scented cube in a little plastic baggie. But, it smelled like bubblegum in the container. But, once I placed a few cubes in my burner, and waiting awhile for the smell to aramonazize the room. I was disappointed, because I didnt smell bubblegum. I smelt nothing. Maybe it's just me, but I'm disappointed in this brand as I hoped to buy more scented products.",Neutral
It was a nice try but it really didn't do anything other than be a regular soap.,Neutral
This is a cute necklace and will make an ok gift for my young granddaughter. However the quality  is not as I expected after reading reviews. The letter was stamped into the charm in a way that the charm is slightly bent in.,Neutral
First wash super wrinkled and a little shrunk,Neutral
"They are on the very light side of paper, expect a little bit of a thicker surface. They are not suitable for hanging on the wall by themselves. I had to buy for frames now they look great",Neutral
"These are pretty, but they are tiny, not like the original picture shows them to be.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought it would be.,Neutral
My husband cuts our grass twice weekly so heighth of grass is not an issue. I think it needs a longer pole to put in the ground. People either do not care to do what the sign asks or it doesn’t stand high enough for them to see it.,Neutral
Well made but a little smaller then we expected,Neutral
"Very pretty bracelet, but I ordered it specifically to use with essential oils and the lava beads have some sort of film on them which prevents the oils from absorbing. Disappointed.",Neutral
"I thought that price was for a set of four.  My fault, I should have been more careful.  So many people/companies trying to take advantage of the consumer with trickery and misrepresentation.  It did say one (next to the photo of 4).  Consumer beware",Neutral
"Super cute, but not very strudy. Broke first time buying them. Not sure, I'd recommend to others.",Neutral
"Technically as advertised with the potential to be attractive given the right sweater to carry the look. But this looks cheap, no way around it. Flimsy packaging did not help",Neutral
"[[VIDEOID:d2463bd0e375f90de73e1544a810829b]] The prongs that hold the stone are very weak. I just received this ring today and already one of the prongs fell off of the ring. I did not do any rough activities with this ring either that would make this happen, I was very gentle. I would expect this kind of thing from a $15 ring, not a $40+ one. Other than that the ring is beautiful.",Neutral
I love it so much! But the chain already snapped!,Neutral
"The weight and everything was good. If you have sensitive skin, this material will irritate it. I put this pendent on a necklace and it gave me a rash.",Neutral
For some reason I thought I was getting a multi pack and not a single tube. Thought it was 2 for some reason even though each of their scents shows at least 3 tubes on the pics so took some.off for that. Should explain its not more than one. And also its far too strong for me anz I love rose but plotting a bit off makes it better,Neutral
Really cool painting but no frame. It was advertised with a frame and now this thing has been sitting for months without a frame because I work too much and haven’t Been able to buy a damn frame because then you forget the size and you question yourself. I’ve bought no joke 3 wrong frames. PLEASE SEND ME A FRAME!,Neutral
"I was disappointed, because the description did not accurately describe the ‘glass’ bracelet.",Neutral
These are OK in a pinch.,Neutral
"I have been using it for a while, however I never wear it for work, since I work in a workshop plus weather here in El Salvador I dont want to expose it to sweat. So far is still in good conditions, still shiny, very delicate and elegant.",Neutral
it was just t small and very hard to put on  smh...,Neutral
Wasn’t the color it was advertised on the site and wound up not matching the outfit I bought it for as a result.,Neutral
My cell phone.,Neutral
I know I ordered 14” but it is smaller than I imagined. Looks nice but the material is flimsy. I was hoping for a metal,Neutral
Interesting style but they would be nicer if they were larger,Neutral
"The picture, and description are a bit fancier than what you get.  I gave this to my gf to wear as a necklace, but it’s really more suited to just hanging from her rear view mirror.",Neutral
Very late! This is unique key ring but way too expensive for me but I like it ok.,Neutral
"Very pale.  I have a moonstone necklace and ring, this stone matches the moonstones perfectly.  I have other opal jewelry and the looks nothing like them.  The workmanship of the necklace is very nice.  It is still pretty. I have added as a layer to my long moonstone  necklace.",Neutral
Wife was happy when she receieved this necklace and wanted to buy them for our daughters too. The necklace broke fairly soon after receiving it. I soldered the broken part and thr next week the other side of the necklace broke too. I dont recommend.,Neutral
"I was under the impression that the receiver's name was gonna be all over the book. Instead it says &#34;the little girl.&#34; It would have been awesome if instead of &#34;the little girl&#34; they used MY LITTLE GIRL'S NAME. For example, instead of using &#34;the little girl can&#34; use &#34;Jane Doe can.&#34; Needles to say I'm disappointed, now I'll just wait and see if she likes it. If she likes it I may give one more star, if she doesn't I'll give only one star.",Neutral
Cute idea but sadly mine comes broken from the clip.. Daughter loves it cause is her name on it so we are looking for a chain so she can use it,Neutral
"Wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it is still pretty.",Neutral
"These were nice, however they are not originals as the title suggests. They are glossy printed photocopies.",Neutral
"I love the quote of course, but it’s not something I couldn’t have done myself for a couple of dollars",Neutral
"These were a little small, but okay",Neutral
"It didn't really fit my nostril.  I have a semi broad and round nose, so maybe that's why.  I ended up just getting my nose pierced for real",Neutral
"This necklace is super cute, but mine arrived with a huge flaw on the crystal. I realize that crystals are natural and flaws are “part of their uniqueness” but mine looks terrible.  The side of the Crystal that the necklace swings to is OF COURSE the side with the flaw. I tried putting the necklace on backward etc but nothing helps. It always goes back to the side of the Crystal with the huge flaw. It looks terrible. As a result, I don’t wear the necklace and it sits on my jewelry wall.  Disappointing because I love the one in the picture.",Neutral
I like it but it's really thick and weighed down my scrub top.,Neutral
Very pretty but too hard for me to put in my ears.,Neutral
I was disappointed with the size of the bead and evil eye. Especially for being a mens bracelet. Quality of beads is poor. Definitely pricey for quality of it. The braided part is sturdy.,Neutral
This product is thick doesn't  smell at all not sure if it really work but it a great oil I would buy it again,Neutral
CUTE NECKLACE BUT TURNS FAST AND NOT MADE OF SLIVER 925,Neutral
Wish they were larger.,Neutral
Pretty but a wee bit chinsy,Neutral
Its ok for price i pay hope they used good quality cotton or fabric,Neutral
The shirt fits really well and is a good length.  I’m a bit disappointed that there’s a hole in the side - about 2” - it looks like the machine missed a spot when joining the seams.  I didn’t notice it until after I washed it and put it on.  Otherwise it’s perfect.,Neutral
"I was sent a tag with my dog’s name misspelled initially, but I was sent a new one for free—great customer service. However, the crystals in the tag have already fallen out on the second one I received and it has been on my dog for just three days. My dog is not a very hyper/active dog and is mainly indoors aside from walks and going outside to go potty. It is a very cute tag, but the crystals are not placed securely unfortunately.",Neutral
"This runs big, odered a 12 -18 month  for my daughter and it fits morre like 18- 24 month",Neutral
"I was excited to receive this ring. But when I got it, the stone was loose and eventually came out. I'm not happy at all. I didn't get the chance to wear it. I think it's great that this is handmade. I am changing my review from one star to three. Because even though it didn't work out with my purchase, I feel pretty good about purchasing another type of ring or getting the one I already have, fixed. I've seen all good reviews on this ring. Which is why I don't want to give up just yet. Wish I could've given it 5 stars because the ring itself overall is beautiful.",Neutral
Good but not worth $10,Neutral
"The plaque is attractive and the saying is catchy, but overall it's really not worth the money.  I didn't read the description well enough or I wouldn't have bought it because it has vinyl lettering rather than carved.  Painted on lettering would have given this plaque a higher-end appearance.<br /><br />Since it's meant for outdoors, I really don't see how it's going to last. The vinyl letters don't appear to have had a sealant sprayed over them and the plaque is very thin.  This is NOT a sign meant for an exposed area...definitely needs to be on a covered porch with protection from moisture.<br /><br />Those who are crafty could simply buy a black plaque from the craft store with 40-50% off coupon, press-on letters from the dollar store, and make it for far less.",Neutral
The product came with no pattern and no help guide to be able to get the design correct.,Neutral
kinda cheap looking,Neutral
The pearl isnt in the center and sits to the left. I don’t wear it because of this. They need to make sure they are all in the center before sending out.,Neutral
"The cupcake stand is OK, but it is not &#34;tiered&#34; as shown in the picture. The picture makes it seem the lowest tier is quite a bit bigger than the top tier. On the one I received, they are almost the same size. Since our wedding is so close, there wasn't time to find anything else, so we kept it.",Neutral
Lovely &#34;acorns&#34; but the hooks are a bit too large.,Neutral
"As shown in the main photo, the stickers are beautiful. I love this design, it’s exactly what my daughters nursery needed! However, I am extremely disappointed in the longevity of these.<br /><br />I am starting to sleep train my 2 month old after Christmas and these stickers were the last needed *touch* for her nursery. THANKFULLY she is not sleeping in her crib yet because these stickers peeled off and one fell into her crib! My husband and I applied these stickers yesterday. We pressed very firmly and made sure they stuck to the wall. In the middle of the night I received an alert on my Nanit about activity in the crib. As my daughter is not sleeping there yet, I was very surprised. When I looked at the crib I noticed one of the big roses had fallen in! Very unsafe!<br /><br />The adhesive is not strong enough. My child may have suffocated by these stickers!",Neutral
"It was cute, but now it's starting to loose color",Neutral
"Love the look and design, but it has already worn off the silver so I am really disappointed.",Neutral
"Bought this as a gift to my son, engraved with his initials.  Just received it and I’m extremely disappointed with the initials. They are HUGE, poorly carved (shaky lines which I evened with a black marker) and the letters are unevenly spaced. The first initial is almost alone, then the middle and last initials are close together.",Neutral
"It’s not shiny & it has nothing to do with being tarnished. It’s how they finished it. I was hoping it would be shiny. Difficult to adjust, but I don’t know  my ring size, so adjustable made sense for me.  It doesn’t seem like silver,& is not hallmarked, so who knows. I’ll wear it a while, and decide if I want to keep it  It’s on the pricey sidd for the quality.",Neutral
The leather was a lot stiffer than I expected,Neutral
I am not too excited about my purchase. I thought it would have more pop. The picture shows the flowers vibrant.  It comes across very dull and looks like a sticker. I wanted it to be more seamless. I wouldn't recommend.,Neutral
I liked that the samples were at least large enough to test the soap. I then found the samples I liked and went to their web site to buy what I liked to find that half of them are not even listed for sale. What the.......,Neutral
Doesn't match picture.,Neutral
"I bought this for my three year old grandson to give his mom for Mother's Day.  I asked the buyer for dimensions, but got no answer.  I was happy to receive it on time, and it was a decent size.  The problem was the bottom of it was bent so it could not stand up.  And, the flowers don't stay unless the flower is long stemmed.",Neutral
I dislike that when I tried it on it smelled of faint cigarettes. But was happy it was in a plastic inner bag as the post office envelope it was mailed in was drenched.,Neutral
"They are super cute, but I bought 2 for nurses cI work with. One broke after second wear.",Neutral
Piece was alot bigger than I thought based on the photo . . .  wanted to use it for an jacket with no buttons.,Neutral
Expensive for what you get. Have been using it for a while....I do not see the fuzz. Sorry.,Neutral
"My wrist is about 7”.  No matter how I try to wrap the band, the clasp is always on top of my wrist next to the watch face instead under my wrist. It’s very pretty and seems well made but sits weirdly on my arm.",Neutral
Cook ok sticks difficult to clean.,Neutral
"It’s definitely a pretty display. Have to share that the one I received came with the base holes larger than the sticks which made the whole display kinda wobbly. I had to use glue in order fix the the issue, and for that I lost the option of taking the display apart or send it back.",Neutral
"Was very pretty but the actual engraving when it arrived was very small and very faint. You cannot see it unless you are right up on top of it like 8 inches in front of it close. And it’s still just very faint, very DAINTY.",Neutral
"Good small green mask, fit my 5 yr old well (but was too small for my 7 yr old). I bought green (for 5 yr old) and red (for 7 yr old). They were 2 different sizes. The green one is ""itchy and scratchy"" as my 5 yr old describes, and she doesn't want to wear it. Thin (nice 1 thin layer), and not see through (which is a bonus), but also not 10000% breatheable. However, they are more breatheable than the muslin thicker cotton fabric.",Neutral
"It's beautiful and love the necklace overall, my only complaint is the Monaghan charm is tin makes me feel as though it won't with stand time very well or for very long!",Neutral
Having your washer and dryer elevated o. Something other than the brand’s pedestal means that a delivery person or technician will not work on your machine until it is removed from the elevated height.  I’ve had to move both my washer and dryer just to have someone service them when they needed repair.  Make sure you have someone who can assist if you have to move either one.,Neutral
Not a terrible choice here but the quality of craftsmanship is a little low. The blanket has knots tied in the wool everywhere unlike another blanket I bought elsewhere which is seamless. Again not a bad choice here but the price should reflect the quality...,Neutral
I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  The picture looks much more sturdy and heavy duty than it really is.,Neutral
The simple packaging was cute and eco friendly. One of the samples was too thin to use/gift to anyone. The smells sent were strong but not my favorite. All were very pretty drying.,Neutral
Update!  The owner contacted me and is sending out the new tag that will be exactly as I expected.  Great Customer service!<br /><br />I was disappointed that my ornament did not have the Bunco tag below the hat as pictured.  That was the main reason I bought it.,Neutral
Bought this as a last resort because I couldn't get the one I wanted here in time. Really expensive for a nylon like material with a printed image and string to tie around your neck.,Neutral
"THIS METAL IS THINNER THEN DOLLAR TREE METAL SIGNS AND IS NOT MADE OF QUALITY METAL!!<br />It arrived quickly in a very thin flat box. Some edging of words are not only sharp enough to get you some stitches, but a piece was actually bend upwards.. (hey makers... thanks, I missed the ER, 1st time stitches were horrid). It could've been avoided by the makers simple act of flattening this LITTLE MORE THAN PAPER THIN metal.<br /> I am just not pleased with this product.  The cutting machine is off a little and leaves jagged edges, which wasn't mentioned that it would be this way on every cut their machine made.<br /> I wanted to like it, but when it hit the floor, it gave a bit and bent a tad now won't lay flush with wall. Smh, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Don't be like me trying to save an extra 10.00s, go ahead and buy better quality one.<br />DISAPPOINTED & DONT RECOMMEND!",Neutral
"I like it, just wish it was more reasonably priced. I would buy more if it was",Neutral
"I didn’t pay attention to them not having frames. When I got frames (11x14), they were a 1/4 inch too large on all sides and I had to cut them, which made me really nervous to do! They look fine now, though.",Neutral
This is a cute necklace that my 11 year old daughter loved. It's not the best quality but then again you get what you pay for. You need to be very gentle with it or it will come apart.,Neutral
"Very thin, lightweight plastic.  I expected a thicker, flexible tag.",Neutral
"I can't totally fault this for being just a picture on paper and not a wood block or canvas because it says that in the description, but the first picture for the advertising is pretty misleading, so will take off points for that. Not worth $12 in the end, but it still looks nice if you frame it. Overal 5/10, would recommend at a lower price.",Neutral
This product is 3d printed so it's not the most reliable or durable. I only use it about once a week for a few hours and the second one I orders broke again.,Neutral
"Beautiful earrings. I bought them because I lost one of my beloved chrysoprase earrings and these looked nearly identical so I thought I could replace it.<br /><br />They’re gorgeous. BUT I don’t think they’re real chrysoprase (which I kind of already suspected based on the price). I paid $250 an earring (so $500 for the pair) for my original chrysoprase earrings. The color of those is super vibrant and if you do a quick search for chrysoprase jewelry you’ll see that it doesn’t run under $180, $200 apiece. This stone is similar but much cloudier and pale than the real deal.",Neutral
The bracelet was just as it appeared but it runs small for men. Additional beads were included but I was not comfortable adding them or taking them to a shop.,Neutral
"The amethyst ring is really pretty, but the description says it is a size 5, and it barely fits my fingers. My ring finger is a size 3.5 (which is tiny enough as it is), and this ring is so tight I’m afraid to leave it on incase my fingers swell I’m sure I would not be able to get it off. My husband got this thinking it was a 5 so that I could wear it on any finger.  Kinda disappointed, this was a Christmas gift to me, and I love it, but not sure I’ll get to wear :(",Neutral
To small for the price of it and very cheap made most of the glitter is gone and I haven't had it that long my daughter loves it so it works,Neutral
Way smaller then expected and advertised,Neutral
"I bought this spoon as a gift for a hard to buy for teenager.  The spoon looks really cool, good weight and nicely polished.  The stamped lettering goes through to the back side of the spoon, leaving a bumpy surface. I wouldn't buy it again. :-(",Neutral
I love that it’s small and compact- size of my hand lol<br /><br />I wish there were gratitude prompts inside of of the notebook BUT it contains sticky’s inside to make your own prompts within the notebooks. Small and light enough to toss into your purse for daily writings,Neutral
"I was excited to receive the band but once I did I was very disappointed due to you can’t hardly see the engraving of the name nor initials it DOES NOT stand out AT ALL!! That was my whole point in buying it to show off my name & initials, I can’t hardly see it MYSELF. It’s cute and the idea of the maker has a good idea but a change HAVE to be made. For example If the band is white the engraving should be another color like for example black so it can stand out, it should be an option that the buyer can choose. Seller I hope you’re reading this because there’s no point in buying this product if the engraving can’t be seen. 👎 NOT SATISFIED! Also the M/L band needs to be longer with more holes.",Neutral
Super adorable but I feel like the seller should state plainly that it's not a true canvas but  canvas board.  Pretty expensive for the materials .,Neutral
The smell to this was not that great. It is easy to apply with the roller but I would not purchase again.,Neutral
I wanted the pink that is shown on the website.  The one I got is very barely the palest of pinks.  I’m sending it back,Neutral
Absolutely gorgeous!  Its like a fake looking concrete address sign. BUT it arrived cracked. Teeny tiny under last number. So I just contacted seller and I will wait and see. But it is beautiful,Neutral
"Certainly variation is expected due to being a natural item. However, the set I received does not have an interesting textured which is the biggest aspect of the charm of having Baroque pearls. One earring might have, but they placed the earring post on that side.",Neutral
I swear they changed the wording on this after I ordered it to include NOT HEIGHT. When I ordered it looked like the name would be 12x52”. What I got was a name that is only 12” long and useless.,Neutral
I got it because gold fill is supposed to last a heck of a lot longer than gold plating but mine wore off within a few months.,Neutral
It was cute but so tiny it is hard to even read the name 🥲,Neutral
"Very well made, looks great. However it stains every business card it contacts. The oils in the leather bleed into the cards badly.",Neutral
"As beautiful as this picture is; it's way over priced considering it's an enlarged photograph.<br /><br />Yes, I'm taking into consideration of the photographer's time, expense and postage.<br />However, $33 for an 8x10 photograph.....",Neutral
Bought for myself. It’s more of a chapter neck style necklace. Smaller than I thought. It fit my 1 year old perfectly.,Neutral
This necklace is cute and was a gift for my sister after she adopted her son. When it arrived I was very disappointed in the quality. The packaging was super cheap and the necklace was NOT worth the price,Neutral
"Nice necklace but the ruby is smaller than I expected, although I know they are expensive in general so shouldn't be surprised maybe.  It's my wife's birth stone and she's never had one so what am I going to say, it makes her happy. If I were to do it again I wouldn't buy it online since I would like to examine it first and spend more for a larger stone.",Neutral
"It's not actually concrete sheet like listing states. It's painted plywood which was a bit disappointing. Other reviewers stated the same letdown. It's still an attractive design, and an upgrade from my old house numbers. I believe the painted wood part is painted with some more durable outdoor paint, it smelled very chemical-y when it arrived. But the stained part I imagine will need to be touched up with time, it's wood after all.<br /><br />I'd recommend this product, but just take note that it's not made of Concrete.",Neutral
"The decals are just adorable and super super cute! However it is not as sticky as I hoped it would be. My walls have a little bit of texture and this morning I found them peeling off after just two days. So i am a little bit heart broken, but the images is cute and very well printed.",Neutral
Cute anklet but the stitches at the ends are bulky and sharp so uncomfortable to wear. Shame.,Neutral
Pretty good. She liked it. Not bad quality.,Neutral
"The set of prints are not quite equal, the tie bomber print seems really well done and detailed in person, as does the snow speeder. The X wing and Walker pictures are very much lacking design and are noticeably weaker in comparison to the bomber/speeder. It also says ""US patent"" at the top left, which is...well...its a little lacking in imagination I think, I would find another artist or dealer to buy some better or higher quality prints over these.",Neutral
"I really love the print, and it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter's room, she absolutely loves anything with elephants...but the word at the top of the page the is not covered by the print is suicide, it just rubs me the wrong way. While I understand that this are to be unique and one of a kind, some thought should be given as to the what words stick out and are not covered.",Neutral
Small just ok,Neutral
I love them BUT the black coloring in the engraving started coming off after about 10 days.,Neutral
The soaps all smell the same,Neutral
This journal is small. It’s really cute but not worth the money I paid. Should be regular size.,Neutral
"The product looks as described, this is one of the best examples of not reading product details and buying things in a rush!! The fonts and colors looked good but the only thing is I wanted to goft my husband for his birthday, he couldnt even understand what he was looking at, so much for the surprise gift!!! I explained and he asked me what does he need to do with this... Excuse him for he is sinned to be non pintetester!!! Shocking!!! But anyway I ordered it the day before his birthday and thought it was already framed but it is a print in cardstock. Just like the other reviewer said we could do it in our printer if one had time. Now this print will sit unframed in the pile of things that are lonely and waiting!!! The owner did her job and delivered on time, but I wouldnt recomnend this if you are planning to gift this as is.",Neutral
wat I dislike it wasn’t made like it was shown the clover was made on the tail side instead of the head side a little disappointed because I like the necklace but they did a rush job didn’t do it like the way it was shown,Neutral
Product is obviously cheap.  Made out of a plasticy material... not metal.  Looks a bit awkward for a conch... it's a bit too small.,Neutral
Chain broke within a few wearings.,Neutral
Smaller than I expected.,Neutral
"Meh, looks ok and was easy put together but its pretty cheap. Im sure it wont last very long.",Neutral
"The ring is beautiful but I’m disappointed about the color. As you can see from the pic, the blue is very different, but it fits and is good quality otherwise.",Neutral
"Beautiful color, my birthstone is emerald, however it did not stay on for 2 days, once I started washed dishes, the polish started chipping, I really wanted to like this polish.",Neutral
"The pendant looks beautiful.  However, the included chain is worthless and cannot be trusted not to break.  It is embarrassing that the chain snapped within minutes of the recipient wearing the necklace.  My Advise:  buy a chain when you purchase this pendant.",Neutral
It was pretty but the chain is cheap looking,Neutral
"Package of 3 arrived with ties in opposite side. Makes it very difficult to wear securely. Unless I rip out the seam and change it, it’s lovely in every way but that. The tie is not at the top, it’s at the bottom. Unless I wear upside down with nose guard at my chin, &lt;sigh>  Not as shown.",Neutral
"This is a super cute idea. I didn't give 5 stars because I don't love how her &#34;E&#34; and &#34;L&#34; touch - really wish they were separated like the other letters. Also I wish I wouldn't have opted for the paint color, only the top is painted the sides of the letters and the back is all still wood looking. Could have done it myself and saved $20....",Neutral
"I like the visual appearance of the item. Unfortunately, like the other item that I had ordered, I’m not too happy with the size. I definitely thought that it would be larger. I guess that I need to pay much closer attention to the measurements. Thank You.",Neutral
I bought another print from this seller and it arrived crisp and clear and the ink was darker. This one is blurry and greyed. I understand they’re vintage prints but you can hardly read the bottom of his one. Looks cool and the other one is everything I’d hoped for but I’m disappointed in this one.,Neutral
The red fiddle is 2 red round circles on the top not the bottom.,Neutral
Is Ok...for what it is maybe too expensive.,Neutral
There was only 3 pictures<br />Relax soak unwind,Neutral
I would make sure to measure if your expecting a oversized ring . Looked larger in pics but nice ring !,Neutral
I ORDER THE LETTER &#34;A&#34;...I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT COMES AS THE SMALL &#34;a&#34; AND JUST LOOKS LIKE A CIRCLE...NOT A BIG &#34;A&#34;,Neutral
"I just want to make the distinction between clovers and shamrocks. Shamrocks have 3 petals or leaves if you prefer the clover has 4. Two different plants. The shamrock was used by St. Patrick to teach us the holy Trinity: God the Father, the Son (Jesus) and Holy Ghost. That is the significance of the shamrock. The 4 leaf clover just doesn't work the same way.",Neutral
Cute but does not stay in book and my legs came off,Neutral
"My husband and I both love this armband. I bought the XL because I am plus size and the description said it would fit an arm that was up to 17 inches around. My arm was 15 inches around and this thing is painfully tight. Too tight to use right now (my husband is using it and he loves it). I may have measured too low, but it said &#34;bicep&#34; and that's where I measured so I don't know. I can tell that I am going to love it once it fits. The phone is very secure in there, I don't think it would fall out. My husband thinks it needs a whole for the ear phone cord, but I think it works fine without one. I would definitely suggest this if you have small arms.",Neutral
"This was such a pretty ring (I got the white opal color in gold) and I got many compliments, but take care when wearing it: I snagged it putting my hand in my pocket and it bent too far open, then it broke shortly after while trying to re-fit it to my finger. The metal is not very strong.",Neutral
Kinda weak,Neutral
"Finish is more of a brushed/scratched finish.  Not what I was expecting, based on photos.  Low price, which is why I didn't bother returning.",Neutral
Much smaller than anticipated.,Neutral
I didnt expect a copy of a copy  sad on that  nothing original of it. but u get what yu get,Neutral
Put together with thread ! Junk,Neutral
"Cute, but I would not recommend paying that much for it.",Neutral
"We ordered these for our changing table.  When they arrived we were quite surprised by how small they were and noticed that the quality was not very good.  We requested a return.  The customer service responded that we could return them but would need to pay for shipping (We already paid $3.99 to have them shipped to us).  The product is only $10, so we decided to keep them and cut our losses.  Just beware that they might not be what you expect.",Neutral
"The bracelet was made from nice material, but I received one for a tracker I don't own, so it's going back.",Neutral
Looks better in the picture than in person.,Neutral
This is okay. Arrived in a timely manner but the color of our sign is more grey then pictured. Would have like a more natural wood stain. It almost looks like the wood is old and has weathered.,Neutral
A thigh is not a butt. The word leg is literally on the Rex's thigh.,Neutral
"It's a cute sign but I thought it would be bigger for the price, a little disappointed.",Neutral
"Can't provide much of a review, the necklace broke prior to ever wearing it.  Returned the product.",Neutral
Nice but reverse side of lettering we can see the etching marks.,Neutral
Shipping was quick and packaged very well.  Item seems fine but I wish I would have seen that numbers and letters can be ordered in diffrent sizes.  I bought the regular size and it is too small.  I guess my mistake I just wish it was a little clearer.,Neutral
"Don't get the mixed colors, they don't look good",Neutral
"chemical smell....not quite leather...  small size, not good value really.",Neutral
"The color is very vibrant but the stones ( yes, I know are natural) are oddly shaped and not very close in size or shape. I enjoy their beauty and energy.",Neutral
"I feel like the wood could've been more heavy like it feels very cheap , but it was a good gift",Neutral
"This is a cute nose ring, but it was a little too big on me. I wore it anyway, but eventually had to remove it because the flat end kept getting lodged in the hole piercing from the inside of my nose. The last day I had it on it had gotten so stuck that it took over 20 minutes to get it out. Needless to say I bled A LOT. A couple of months has passed and I just tried it on again and same thing, stuck. Unfortunately, this nose ring didn't work for me at all. =((((",Neutral
These hoops are thinner than paper clips. Too light weight. I was expecting something more substantial.,Neutral
Was not pleased with the invitation's. They looked like they had been cut to short . The envelope was about a quarter of an inch larger  like it wasn’t the right envelope. I’m on a time frame and will use them . I’m not real picky but was disappointed. I’m sorry .,Neutral
Its nice but a whole lot smaller than you expect.,Neutral
It's really pretty and nicely readable. My only issues are that the chain itself is pretty flimsy and tangles extremely easily....and of course since the chain is flimsy it's difficult to untangle. I'd like to just switch out the chain but the bar is not interchangeable 😞,Neutral
"The scent has muskiness in it, and is not true orange blossom. But it's kinda nice, just some people prefer this type but I don't. Was hoping for more of a basic organic orange blossom scent",Neutral
"As cute as this is, it does not hold up to weather. It turned cloudy and rusty.",Neutral
It’s not as nice as expected. But once ironed it worked,Neutral
"It will do ! I do like how it came packaged neatly, and on time, it looks decent  and you can’t beat the price.....",Neutral
They're pretty and unique but can be difficult to put in and are bigger than I expected,Neutral
Love the. But they are much bigger than I thought,Neutral
This is a great gift. My review -3 Stars- is because the size is tiny. Picture makes it look much larger. Gave it as a gift to a small female and it barely fits. It’s not badly made for the price.,Neutral
"Fortunately, my kid loves trains, but I was led to believe that the set ordered would have rainbow images in addition to the letters of my child's name. Instead, it was trains.  If you aren't ok with a surprise, I would contact this seller direct to find out what images you will actually receive.",Neutral
Thought these were more of an off white. They are really taupe with brown stems. Cute design but doesn't match the aesthetic I wanted,Neutral
I have noticed that after about a month or two of use the T in my name started to come up. I was able to get to to stick back on for now. Hopefully it stays that way.,Neutral
"Smells good, doesn’t last very long",Neutral
Wish they were larger,Neutral
"Image not as vibrant and clear as shown, making it not worth the $12.50 I paid.  Still a nice mouse pad though.",Neutral
My son chose these ina 5x7 size. I was surprised when they arrived. They are just flag design printed on glossy photo paper. Based on the price I expected more. Quality of photo is good.,Neutral
These are so pretty! I’ve had them for almost a month and have worn them a few times. The white bead or cloud seems to be peeling and there is a blue gem underneath. Not too happy about that.,Neutral
I've met MR Posr Malone many times and have become familiar with his signature stench.<br />This air freshener captures the odor perfectly.<br />Smells exactly like a communal bathroom with an athlete's foot infestation in a boys group home,Neutral
"It's just a printed poster with a printed number and a printed certificate of Ath Etensity, I did like the movie though, that's why I bought the print.",Neutral
"This is a pretty Fleur De Lis, however, the shape is totally odd. Very uncomfortable - I can't wear it for long periods of time",Neutral
Eh- just okay. A lot smaller than I anticipated.,Neutral
"quick delivery, decent product for the money",Neutral
Fit a little big,Neutral
I've ordered this one before and it had an amazing smell but this batch had no smell.,Neutral

Cheap materials lost it within a week and we have a gentle small dog. Disappointed actual tag was cute.,Neutral
"It’s good to have the handle because holding the TC77 scanner is small & awkward. It’s good to have, but the trigger needs work.. there needs to be some spring action going on in there otherwise the trigger is useless",Neutral
"When I received my bracelet, it wasn't what I was expecting. The bracelet is beautiful, but it was smaller than I expected. The engraving on the bracelet isn't very deep and hard to see. It is an okay product. I don't think I would purchase again for another occasion.",Neutral
Not bad for the price. Gift for my granddaughter. She will enjoy it.,Neutral
The nose ring is pretty although it projects out farther than I’d like This would be better suited for a septum nose ring instead.,Neutral
"This looks terrific and I wanted to use it.  BUT the hooks that hold the enclosed string are too low.  So once I hung it, the plaque tilted forward.  I wanted it to hang flat.  If the hooks were closer to the top, it would fix it.  I returned it.",Neutral
I got these for my boyfriend and I. I wear mine nearly everyday but have never gotten it wet and my boyfriend wore his too and never got it wet. But after a couple weeks the silver finish ends up turning like a greenish gold color. They're comfortable and cute but if you wear it everyday it starts to tarnish and its not as pretty.,Neutral
"The slime was watery, and even after following directions to fix it, the texture was still bad.  So, i threw it out, and wrote the seller that i was not happy with her product. The seller, however, was decent and gave me a full refund. Thank you.",Neutral
"Not mounted, not framed, just a piece of paper.  Cute phrase, not impressed with the product.",Neutral
"This is ok, I won’t return it but if I saw it in a store I would walk on by.  Extremely small, it’s a bit silly looking.",Neutral
Only received 1 page for the money I spent.  I guess I need to read better.,Neutral
purchase this product that came with a sprayer that had no indication of how to work.. once I figured out that there is a little latch on the side.. now nothing is coming out from this nizzile on it.  can someone let me know will I be able to use this product for this defictive part,Neutral
"Was hoping for more of a smoked, burnt wood look as seen in other pictures online for this product. Very pricey to be disappointed. Buyer beware.",Neutral
The product is cute but it came in the wrong color. So Im sad about that.,Neutral
Smaller than I thought it would be,Neutral
It's okay,Neutral
The decals were good. A little hard to install but that's just the nature of things. Getting them all aligned. I do feel like a bit of an idiot though because you can get the same thing on Etsy for about $10. Not good value for the money!,Neutral
"I loved the outside, but I thought it would be made out of a stronger substance.",Neutral
"The Rose Quartz  appears to be a sturdy bracelet .  However, the color is a light pink and much lighter than pictured.",Neutral
"This airpod case is super cute and simple. The custom name is made well and seems like it will last for a while. Unfortunately, the case that i received fits the bottom of airpod case perfectly but the top flap does not fit at all and is usually separate from the airpod case top and must be pushed down each time, it hangs loose which is pretty annoying.",Neutral
"I loved the saying, but was disappointed upon arrival because there was no disclaimer that it wasn’t framed.",Neutral
Works but feels flimsy when you push the button,Neutral
"read the description and measurements before purchasing, it’s a nice product, but not poster sized, my mistake for not reading closely, will keep it anyway",Neutral
Got this for my son and he loves it. Only three stars bc the clamp seems cheap. It bent the first day and my son was unable to close it. It took me about half hour to fix it so it closes now but he has to be very careful when closing it.,Neutral
It is a nice case and protects my phone from falls so far. The only problem it that it has a metal plate on the back so you cannot use wireless charging without removing the case.,Neutral
"it's clearly some sort of vinyl piece adhered on a normal light switch cover.  I had hoped the quality would be higher, but it's still pretty good.",Neutral
"I was very disappointed when i received the necklace, because it looks better on the pictures here than in person. Doesn't even look like a good gold plated quality. It would have been a great gift if it didn't look so cheap. Birth stones could be better quality and accuracy as well. Disappointed overall!",Neutral
Cute -- but very thin ...spend the extra money to buy leather or a better quality label,Neutral
"They look good, but they hurt my feet. There is no padding in the soles at all so it’s like walking barefoot. And they scratched my heels pretty badly! I had to put bandaids on my heels after only 5 minutes of wearing them, before I even left the house. But that didn’t matter it was already too late. Both heels had huge blisters. I couldn’t even put them back on for 2 weeks. I still like the way they look though, so I wear them sometimes when I know I won’t be walking or standing for long but I put clear bandaids on the spots where I got blisters before and try to walk slowly so they don’t come off exposing my skin to the shoes and the possibility of getting blisters or cuts again. I wish they were a little better quality because they are super cute and I get lots of compliments on how they look, I just can’t recommend them to anyone because they are so uncomfortable.",Neutral
It helps some but not alot,Neutral
Good quality print. Will be framing it for my office to remind myself that a better world is possible if we want it badly enough. RIP John (Lennon). We miss you.,Neutral
"I love the keychain, however the glass is scratched.",Neutral
"I got to admit, I first thought it's going to be a small heart rose quartz, turned out the size was perfect and its beautiful. I wear this everyday but of course I took it off before I showered. Very nice jewelry though but there's better options, this works fine until it is completely faded. A crystal was nice so replace the chain wasn't a problem. 👍",Neutral
"Received my necklace way earlier than expected, thank you for the expedited shipping - upon inspection, i was very disappointed with the chain itself, very cheap and not the correct length. the pendant however, is very well done. would purchase again. 3/5 stars simply because i cannot use the chain provided.",Neutral
"I love this bookmark so much but unfortunately mine broke as soon as I opened it. One of the lega fell right off, sad because the idea gives me so much joy.",Neutral
"I was so happy with this deodorant at first. Applied it first thing in the morning and literally lasted all day. And that's even with some mini workouts.<br />After using it for 4 weeks it started changing the color of my armpits, they were getting really dark.. so I immediately stopped using it and threw it away.<br />Not sure why this happend, but if you want to take a chance on this deodorant, it really works ,but there is a chance it will darken your armpits.",Neutral
good for price,Neutral
Picture looked better,Neutral
"The necklace disc is very small in size. I was expecting it to be a little bigger in size. The necklace is not intended for adult wear, but for a child.",Neutral
It’s a very simple but beautiful pendant. The necklace they send it on has started to discolor but you can’t take the pendant off to put it in another chain.,Neutral
"I messed up, this helped",Neutral
They are pretty difficult to get off their b,Neutral
Disappointed in consistency of engraving. Some lettering was lighter then others in set. Also very light weight. This was a gift for a friend's new kitchen. Will not purchase again.,Neutral
Top of the bezel is now silver as well as the band shank.  Lovely ring but gold didn't last like I had hoped.,Neutral
Product is great... but came three days later than expected.,Neutral
"I was willing to pay the extra money because having these personalized meant a lot to me, and because I saw it was a small business, but the cost does not make sense given the quality unfortunately. I will be keeping them rather than returning them, but I‘m disappointed to say I wouldn’t purchase from the seller again.",Neutral
"Arrived in sealed cellophane, item appears to be organic-type boutique product, but once the seal was broken....<br />WET DOG!!<br />DIRTY CIGARETTES!!<br />SMOKE AND SOUR FUR!<br /><br />Guys, if you WANT to convince your consumer you're selling an upscale, ethically-sourced product, the SMELL can't tell your end user EVEYTHING HE OR SHE NEEDS TO KNOW about your manufacturing process.

"My glass had the glass on the inside broken and cracked around where the bullet has been pressed. Terrible QA for a drinking glass. I returned it for a replacement. I really wish Amazon would be more careful about selling defective glasses. Update: the replacement glass is just fine, no problems.",Neutral
I’ve ordered these masks before and really liked them. My last order the elastic ear loops were stretched out and they didn’t fit as well as previous ones. Very disappointed.,Neutral
I think the craftsmanship is great and the details of the wheels moving are really nice. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because it was 1 month late getting here and I paid for pegs on my daughter's name. It didn't come with that. I don't like the trains and I never got to customize that. I thought I would get what came with the picture in this color scheme.  Nothing wrong with the product if this is what you order.,Neutral
"Muy lindo,  pero muy mal acabado. Devuelto.",Neutral
"Pretty, well made, clear details",Neutral
It's a mental thing...lol Replaying my golf round in my head works better for me lol,Neutral
"It’s a cute concept but it is kind of cheap material and the picture is already cracking. However, it was good in a pinch and my 4 year old loves it so that’s really all that matters!",Neutral
Awesome but much smaller than I expected. Also the goop is super shiny and sort of cheap looking. Cool novelty jewelry though!,Neutral
These were pretty but they are basically just cardstock with pictures on them. I could have printed them at home. I would have been nice to see some sort of backing or frame with them.,Neutral
"I measured before I ordered this item. It seemed to be what I was looking for…but after receiving it, Well, it’s just too tiny. It looks like a nursery quilt.",Neutral
"Beautiful, i love the colors; a little disappointed with the size",Neutral
"Bluey is 100% a girl and the show is importantly based on SISTERS. Dont go stereotyping that bc she takes after her father and is blue that she is the ""boy/brother""<br />Cute graphics but highly misleading and sexist",Neutral
I love the style and the concept. It really does glow in the dark!!! The down size is that its not real silver and tarnishes very fast. I wish there was some kind of coating to put on it to keep it from tarnishing. I would have given this five stars if it didn't have that problem.,Neutral
"It’s pretty, but it won’t stay on my ear. I doesn’t close its soft metal.",Neutral
"While the writing is clear and bold, and the material used is durable, the product itself is too big for most leashes.  It slips up and down the leash and and turns and twists during a walk.  It needs to be smaller in the width by about an inch so it doesn’t move around.",Neutral
All pages have the same background. Makes it look kind of funny.,Neutral
Way smaller than I thought,Neutral
Really like these but they made for men so they are a big for a woman that wears a size 6.5 shoes  so keep that in mind please but beside that they are a great gift specially for someone that loves to drink,Neutral
"We purchased four of these (for two different residences).  They look nice and delivery was prompt. I’ve deducted two stars because the engraving is too shallow.  With other adjacent tags like rabies and town registration the lettering wears almost illegible far to soon.  They do have one with deeper lettering, but it only comes in steel coloring.  It’s not as attractive, but works much better.",Neutral
I really loved this necklace when I got it for mother's day... However it is now tarnished... I have only with it a handful of times in the year that I've owned it.,Neutral
"The sticker is cute, and it arrived quickly. I tore one edge slightly when I was separating the backing. It is sticking well but definitely has some bubbles, that I can’t get out. It could simply be because it rained later on the day I applied it, plus I tore the edge slightly. Or it could be the humidity of Fl.",Neutral
"The cloth itself is quite lovely -- though I would have preferred cloth material to the plastic coated material that it is (although easy to clean). I give it 3 stars because it has no zipper or snaps to take the cloth off the umbrella table. As it is, one would have to take the umbrella out of the table each time you put the cloth on the table and each time you take it off.  I cut the cloth and will have the tailor put either snaps or a zipper on it. I bought two of these cloths in different colors -- really like them both, except for this nuisance. American-made cloths usually come with an &#34;escape route&#34; for those made for umbrella tables.<br /><br />Ruth Dunner",Neutral
The case is beautiful BUT ours has one defect.  the one we received covers the microphone so we have to take the cover off to use FaceTime or speakerphone. If not for this I would have given it 5 stars,Neutral
The print is blurry if you look closely. It's not horrible from a distance but since it's meant to be read it bugs me 🙂,Neutral
"The pin is nice and well made, would not call it a scarf or shawl pin as it is very large, much larger than I expected.  More of a hair clip.  the pin is large and I feel like it would leave a large hole in a scarf or shawl so will not use it for that.",Neutral
The bracelet is beautiful but I wore it once and the clasp broke. I’m just glad it happened at home so I didn’t lose it.,Neutral
Very cute but string inside broke only after 3 months of wear. Pryed off cute button and super glued to new reel to continue wearing.,Neutral
I found the bombs to be very disappointing in that the bath bombs are not that fragrant. The bombs come in a nice box and are very nice looking but the whole purpose of the bombs are to add fragrance to your bath. I would not reccommend the product.,Neutral
"Loved it except the color of the taco seemed too dull/faded.  Now that I look harder at the pic (after the fact), I can see the faded color of the taco.  That's on me for not noticing ahead of time. Otherwise, it was packaged very well and received super fast.  The service was great!",Neutral
Love the earrings.  Just what I was looking for.  Only problem was that there were only 3 earring backs in the package so I cannot wear them right away.,Neutral
Pretty locket but doesn't glow as advertise.,Neutral
I bought this with the thought that it was fully a toggle clasped necklace but it has a regular clasp in the back.,Neutral
Beads are a bit large and it is not well made,Neutral
I like the design on the towels but not the feel of the towel itself. For guest use in a powder room it’s ok.,Neutral
"While it smelled good up close, it didn’t throw out much scent. I had high hopes as it’s one of the few on the market.",Neutral
They're on a glossy photo paper which makes them look much less vintage.,Neutral
"These masks are comfortable but really frustrating to adjust.<br />You have to put them on right (thankfully there's a wire for your nose, so you know which end is up), which means you have to adjust the cords up and down and over your ears...<br />They're very soft and in pretty colors but they're rather hard to wear.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought. Not great quality.,Neutral
Nice color but the size was smaller than expected. No vintage looking at all,Neutral
I really love these earrings they were my favorite. But they broke too easily. I had a lot of compliments on them I just wish they lasted longer than a month,Neutral
The lavender scent is barely smelling during the shower time. Disappointed.,Neutral
"The stone looks nothing like the pictured stone. The pictured stone is shiny with a greenish luminescent hue. The stone I received is completely gray, it has the correct name on the package but doesn’t seem like the correct stone type. The stone is also pretty small.",Neutral
Very sparkly.,Neutral
This isn’t exactly what I had in mind when I purchased it. I wanted to use it for cleaning purposes but is hard to do when it comes with the herbs in the bottle.,Neutral
"Over all self explanatory instructions, you can get this for 60% less on Etsy and they’ll include both sides.",Neutral

"Worked out nicely for a birthday party. Put these in the cupcakes.  Glitter didn't come off in the cupcakes. Was really glad, because I thought it might.",Neutral
"These are very cute, and they are functional for quick use. But be aware that the decorations are *paper*, and they will absorb moisture from the cupcake/frosting. So if you put them in more than just a few minutes prior to serving the cupcakes, there will be a noticeable moisture-absorption line which deepens the color.",Neutral
My nose is pierced weird and this having no latch makes it okay.. but not comfortable 100%>,Neutral
"I dint know what ""sheerness"" is, but whatever. I mentioned it. It was SUPPOSED to be a gift but the cheap plastic gems are too embarrassing. Like at least use some glass or stone...nobody expected the real deal, but, plastic? So ugly. The engraving is cool. The color of the necklace is pretty. Thickness is what we expected.",Neutral
"I was so excited to receive my order. I read all the reviews and took the advice of ordering 16/18” in size, which stated that it would very big. Sadly I was not not expecting it to be so small. I should have doubled the size.",Neutral
"Update: the Helm is nice, however the magnet did not work on our state room door. The maker needs to add a stronger magnet. We had to double back tape to have the helm stick to the door.<br /><br />We received this today. We love it and it sticks well to refrigerator and front door. Now to try it on our cabin cruise door soon. Fingers crossed.",Neutral
Smells amazing but if you sit too long it slightly stains the skin. Lmfao. I'd buy it again though. 🤷🏻‍♀️,Neutral
It’s a cool ornament but very small and thin.,Neutral
Received item bent on corner/edge. It’s a Thin metal & packing wasn’t enough to protect.  Cute item but too bad you receive damaged. Overpriced for receiving damaged.,Neutral
and the cleats are very small-- would not recommend,Neutral
"these are TINY. I knew they'd be small, but didn't realize how small. Because of their size, you can hardly read what they say. I personally think they are way too small for the price. The quality seems decent, though they do pop open and fall off my daughter's jacket. She tried putting them on her backpack, still the same, they just fall off. I've found them laying in the floor through out the house. I can't recommend these at this price point, just too small.",Neutral
"The leather and design on it are beautiful and gender neuteral. The metal fittings that go into the stock apple watch fitting for mounting the band are garbage (at least for the one I received). Could be I received a bad one, but its so loose and wiggles so much I keep thinking my apple watch is going to fall out of it.",Neutral
"I was so excited to receive this as a gift for my boyfriend! All in all I like it, glad the quote I wrote was correct,  but I thought they would name the city and state, Im in Hawaii and they just put Oahu instead of Honolulu, HI like it's advertised. Do I think it's worth 40? No maybe 25 tops.",Neutral
The 'GOLD' is more bright and orange-ish than I like.,Neutral
Leather is great was disappointed that the hardware did not match what was pictured. Part that holds the keys is chrome instead of brass.,Neutral
"Average gift, usable, but not special, high quality I was looking for. I gave VERY specific directions on the engraving and the directions were not followed and no follow up communication to let me know it would not be the same as I requested. The gift is usable, but I am disappointed in the engraving, the customer service, and the end product. I did my research, gave detailed instructions and the final product was a letdown.",Neutral
"These decor pieces are really nice looking and they look lovely on the wall. It's a four piece set that you can use together or spread in different areas. The boards aren't too thick, nor too thin. They have little flappy hinges on each board to hang these on a picture nail, so the damage to a wall is minimal.<br /><br />The major issue for me is the missing punctuation and missing words on two plaques. The first one that says ""This is us"" has words underneath that says, ""Our life. Our story. Our home"" It's missing the period after home, which really bothers me. The other one says, ""Bless this"" then underneath it says, ""And all who enter"". It's missing the word 'home' which is a HUGE error! I feel if a company is going to make beautifully decorated decor items, they would at least check their grammatical issues. These errors stick out like a sore thumb and is rather aggravating.<br /><br />Overall, these are beautiful plaques and they would look beautiful on the wall. Due to the missing punctuation and word, I don't think I can keep these on my wall. I really hope the company fixes these errors so I can get another set because they're beautiful, well-made, and would look lovely in my living room. If these two errors don't bother you, then these will be worth buying. If errors bother you, like they do me, I don't suggest buying these decor pieces. I guess it all comes down to your personal preference.",Neutral
Really like these. I would have given 5 stars if the part that goes into the ear was longer for larger ear lobes.,Neutral
While the quality of the image is very good it would’ve been nice for this company to state that the dimensions are strictly the paper size. The image has a half inch? white border which makes finding a non custom frame/mat for the poster very difficult.,Neutral

The earrings are pretty however the size is too small,Neutral
Fantastic bottle. Horrendous customer service. I hope you do not need it in a hurry. I love the bottle would have bought three more if I didn’t wait 5 weeks from Florida to Connecticut. No response when you email them. Very happy with the quality of the product. I will shop other sources as this was the wrong vendor.,Neutral
I ordered a box of 6 hooks and only received 5. I have enough screws for 7 hooks which is great to have an extra but I really needed that last hook for my project.,Neutral
"Do you see the bed in that product photo? Do you see the product with Sophie's name proudly displayed?<br />Well, look more closely at the product measurements.<br />Either the product or the photo has been tweaked. It is not that large compared to a standard sized pillow.<br />Other than that it is a very cute little piece. My granddaughter's name is spelled Kassadee and I was worried that they wouldn't be able to place her name very well into the design, but it worked.<br />It's not a bad product, but when planning a room design, most walls will dwarf this product so you might want to accompany this with something.",Neutral
"Pretty but they are flimsy and bend easily. Difficult to fasten without applying pressure so they lose their round shape quickly. Beautiful earrings, sad they bent out of shape so fast.",Neutral
"These earrings are  t i n y.  It came  as a surprise a just how small they were.  The color is lovely but the size wasn’t indicated very well, or at all.  And I was under the impression they were full spheres.<br />Just be aware.",Neutral
"I was a little disappointed in the ""T"" monogram. It's so curly you can't tell what letter it is. The wreath itself it lovely.",Neutral
Something I could have made at home. Came with the stained smell. Sturdy wood.,Neutral
It was so nice but it hasnt even been 2 weeks and the letters are coming off,Neutral
"This stone has a sharp edge and I don’t know what to do.  It’s for a Hanukkah present and I don’t have time to return it and wait for another.  How could they even send out a stone like this?  Also, FYI, it’s very dull and not in the least bit shiny.",Neutral
It’s so great until the image starts peeling off. One of his lenses on glass is chipped and the glaze where the spoon handle sits is also chipped. I’ve only hand washed,Neutral
pillow case was not square as shown in the photo so it was a little disappointing.,Neutral
Extremely beautiful.  Very well made. I was very proud of this purchase made me feel really good to buy from this buyer and location. But having issues keeping these guys tight on the wall.  May be a user error.,Neutral
The product is nice and seems to be made well. Unfortunately it is not the design as advertised. It is a disappointment.,Neutral
I thought that the white part was also sea glass but it is wood.,Neutral
I received my shipment late and was short two bows. It was too close to Christmas to return. Very nice looking.  To of the bows fell apart when I went to hang do I had to re tie.,Neutral

"Overall the keychain looks decent. I will admit that at first it looks a little cheap and rubbery like, but I do like the simplicity of it. The heart is a decent size. Hopefully with time it looks better.",Neutral
Druzy color is not as brilliant as shown in picture.,Neutral
"I was disappoint that one of my letters had a hole in it and we had to tape with shipping tape just to get through party . We are unable to use again, which is one thing that attracted me to this item. I wanted to hang in my daughters room after her party. :(",Neutral
The kyanite is great quality but the type of necklace rope type material isn’t what I wanted :(,Neutral
"I’m not sure if this did anything. The water was a brownish color right when I put the detox mix in it, so I couldn’t tell if anything changed after sitting for 15 minutes. I guess my hair feels lighter? I was really looking forward to seeing the difference in how the water looked so I could tell if it worked and how dirty my hair may have been. Maybe I got a batch with a lot of whatever the brown specks are because the water was definitely not the clearish-white color I see in other peoples pictures.",Neutral
Nice earrings but much smaller than expected!,Neutral
The detail is really good but the key rings need to be stronger. My husband’s broke within 4 days,Neutral
"To fake looking,, but it cute",Neutral

Stones are much smaller than others I purchased from thus comany<br /><br />Stones are small and beautiful needs to enlarge stones!,Neutral

Too loose,Neutral
"I did not like the quality of this necklace and did not find it suitable as a gift; very disappointed. On the up side, the vendor worked with me and I was able to return it.",Neutral
a little small,Neutral

Smaller than I expected.,Neutral
Good product<br />But arrived too late for our party,Neutral
"If you're buying this necklace because you're hoping for the properties of Lapis Lazuli, (or just want a piece of actual lapis in general) you're out of luck - this is most likely a dyed composite with mica flecks added in this very convenient shape that fits the stone.  (see microscope photo - flecks of blue dye = not actually blue.)<br /><br />(nerd talk:  Real lapis Lazuli has a Mohs hardness of 5-6, which means while a stone of higher hardness would be able to scratch it, but it will resist scratches from anything lower than 5 on the Mohs scale.  with a piece of calcite--Mohs hardness 3-- I easily scratched a line into it.  That would not be physically possible with actual lapis.)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this isn't pretty.  It is.  the chain and bail are simple, and suit the stone well.  It all looks very nice.  But the fact that they're lying about it being genuine and preying on people with all the talk of how it ""helps complete your beauty and chakra""  (actual quote from the packaging)  That's gross.  Just sell it as a lovely handmade necklace.  People will pay for that.  It's a cute set.<br /><br />A quick look into the company shows that they've applied in Greece for a patent for ""Jewelry and imitation jewelry.""  Make of that what you will.  I recommend buying an equally pretty inexpensive stone from someone who's not lying to you about what it is.<br /><br />PS.  Dat not hematite either.",Neutral
"This is a great little gift for a little one however, writing is a bit hard to see. I would prefer if the name was darker and bolder.  But it is still adorable, and both my granddaughters loved.  I bought one in rose gold and one in yellow gold, both really nice.",Neutral
The backs are too loose easy to fall off,Neutral
"Loved the idea of all this. My gf was extremely excited about it. All The options made it super fun. Unfortunately first one came with spine broken. Seller was on the ball in replacing, however even the second one was a little broke.",Neutral
I was really excited for this but I don’t think the crystals are real. The packaging was nice and the cord is nice as well.. just really big on authentic crystals,Neutral
"This is much smaller than pictured and for that reason alone I’m giving it three stars. The dinosaur is not bigger than my hand. It is cute and did go on easily and has not fallen off, but I was hoping for something quite a bit bigger. I mean not huge, just based on the picture here it’s not that big. Should work fine if you actually measure, I don’t because that’s a lot more work than I want to put in for a kids room!",Neutral
Link broke after 2 days,Neutral
"I considered returning this because it is so thick the dispenser doesn’t even work. But I do like the smell so I decided to keep it and just pull the dispenser out and squeeze the bottle to access the lotion. The scent is strong and a bit like mens cologne, but I like it enough to use it",Neutral
Over priced. Nothing special.,Neutral
i gave it three stars because they don't remove easy and do tear very easily.,Neutral
"While these are beautiful and stick well, the extremely fine details (like the tentacles on the butterfly or the think loop on the &#34;W&#34;, do not stay on very long.",Neutral
"It is very pretty but for the money, the order was not what I expected.  I thought there should have been more sheets and the envelopes are not very attractive to match the stationery.  I would not order it again.",Neutral
"Felt like chain is to fragile, very very small and light weight.",Neutral
Arrived broken :( seems to be made out of very lightweight/fragile plaster,Neutral
Beautiful but really big and no way to adjust size had to give it to my son.,Neutral
Tarnished quickly. Became tired of having to clean it every day. Nice otherwise.,Neutral
It’s nice wish it was as vibrant as the picture,Neutral
"It's very hard to put in my nose. It takes too long to put it in. I had to get help to put it in. But once it was in,  it was very comfortable.",Neutral
Nice easy to put up on smooth wall.,Neutral
Dislike that I can not exchange it,Neutral
"The idea for this ornament is clever.  Product quality isn't great.  The writing is unclear, even a bit blurry.  No time to return and find something else, but beware this ornament may disappoint you.  It did me.",Neutral
"To start off the print quality is very poor. I understand it on canvas but the picture quality is just bad. It's like look at a 1980 tv on a tube television. The delivery time was also excessive in my option, especially since they charge for shipping. When i finally received my package it was damaged upon opening the box... was very mad. The out side of package had no damage so this means it was put into the box with the damage preexisting. In any case i contacted the seller and they replaced it quickly but the second print was even poorer quality.. i guess the saying goes you get what you pay for. in this case garbage.",Neutral
"The necklace it self is pretty, it is just way too smaller than I expected...",Neutral
Liked how pretty but thought there was a stone. Just mirrored to look like stone.,Neutral
Its not as strong of a smell as i would have liked. I have their pipe tobacco and WOW its strong. The smell is good but not very potent.,Neutral
These are pretty little earrings. My only concern is that they snag on things. It would be nice if the prongs were smoother.,Neutral
The gymnast was so small and you couldn’t tell what the wire was representing! The othe pieces were good but not the gymnast,Neutral
The lid falls off all the time,Neutral
Smaller than expected not as big as I’d like,Neutral
Happy wth all except the engraving. I would rather play a little more and actually SEE the lettering. Checking into gold lettering to put in to the engraving.,Neutral
"This is a much smaller bottle than the pictures would leave you thinking. The rosemary and lemongrass scent is strong and lasts a few minutes. Also, it's really hard to review this product since I couldn't even apply it correctly. The product might work, but the nozzle doesn't! The nozzle ""sprays"" in small globs and can’t be adjusted. Other then that, I can't say more about the product since I couldn't really get a good application.",Neutral
I lost the necklace in the parking lot at our club house.  I was lucky to have found it the next day after back tracking my steps.  The clasp was gone from the chain. The artist had also placed the date on wrong side and broke up the sentiment.,Neutral
"Super cute, came before expected, but one of the letters was peeling off and there was absolutely no packing paper or anything in the box, just the pumpkin.",Neutral
"This is a really cute concept. The picture is adorable, but the printing is low quality. The image is pixilated. A bit disappointed given the price.",Neutral
"This is a bit short for my standard issue 1950's ceramic toilet paper embedded dispenser.  So although it does work it is loose since the spring loaded part of it never activates so there is no tension and it is the spring tension which keeps these things firmly held in the dispenser.  It will do for now, but I will try to find another one that is a bit longer.  I am searching for wooden only as I try not to buy  in plastic.",Neutral
"These shoes are awesome. The soles are very quiet so I don’t wake up my family early in the morning. I ordered a half size down, but they are still too large, which is really really annoying. And I can’t return to Lithuania. Maybe I can find someone to give them to so I can order another pair.",Neutral
"Very cute! It shows that you can put something on the bottom, but when it was time to check out, I was only able to put a name on the top. I wish I could have put the date on the bottom. This was very misleading.",Neutral
Not bad. Very small. Approximately the size of a dime. It looks ok though. But definitely smaller than it seems in the picture.,Neutral
I knew it wouldn’t be tall but it’s much smaller than thought. It’s cute but it’s little. Looks way bigger in photos.  FYI.,Neutral
Absolutely beautiful pendant. Daughter loved it. But chain was very weak and broke almost immediately.,Neutral
"The sticker is cute, and it arrived quickly. I tore one edge slightly when I was separating the backing. It is sticking well but definitely has some bubbles, that I can’t get out. It could simply be because it rained later on the day I applied it, plus I tore the edge slightly. Or it could be the humidity of Fl.",Neutral
Cute. It did look shinier than expected. It was a cute purchase and for the price a great gift.,Neutral
Broke easy,Neutral
I love hammered jewelry but was very disappointed with this ring. Looks much larger in the picture than in person.,Neutral

"Product seems great, but was leaking when I opened the package.",Neutral
"I really wanted to love this Boho Wrap Bracelet, but I could not. I knew that it wrapped around your wrist as stated in the description of the product, but I did not like how it wrapped around my wrist. It crisscrossed over itself and felt odd when I rested my wrist on it. It wrapped around my wrist several times and didn't feel comfortable to me. It is beautiful and looks lovely, and if having it crisscrossed doesn't bother you then try it, but it is not for me.",Neutral
After 2 weeks it has freyed and not very appealing.,Neutral
"So my fiancé got me 3 of these rings for Christmas, they sent me the wrong birthstone. I emailed and got the correct ring, but they’re great rings, I wear them all the time and have yet to get a green finger. Small, dainty, but so meaningful.",Neutral
"I love the shape and size of these earrings. I was disappointed however, because even though I knew they would not be real rubies, the description and the online picture led me to believe they would be red. Instead they are a pink color. I had ordered them to wear with a red outfit and they did not look good with it at all.",Neutral
I love the minimalist design and the small diameter as they’re hard to find but it SO difficult to put it in. It looks very pretty overall but it HURTS when I tried to put it in the way they said. I feel like these ate meant to used only on earlobes not on cartilages. So I had to open the hoop the way I wasn’t supposed to. I guess the beauty comes with the pain. My other concern is that a little opening on the hoop might get stuck with hair too. I wish there was another way to make these cute hoops.,Neutral
"The engraving is correct, the purpose of putting His on her bracelet, is that you belong to her.  Is a metaphor.  Very nice detail",Neutral
The pictures looks bigger than the real size. Very small to me.,Neutral
El lazo está bien pero los charms me parecen q no son de tan buena calidad. No me encantaron,Neutral
"I think two of my letters are backwards, hope they respond",Neutral
This was cute but I thought it was 2 straps instead it was just one. I went back and read the details and it was supposed to be just one. I thought it was pricey for one strap,Neutral
"I love the style of this ring and how it looks on my hand, but the gold finish starting coming off within the first week (on the palm side).",Neutral
I love the design of it but the quality isn’t there it’s just stuck on with some sub par adhesive and will not last long at all,Neutral
They're beautiful but too large for me. I have returned them and reordered.,Neutral
Nice,Neutral
"WRAPPED IN SHIPPING PAPER  BEFORE THE FINISH CURED, THERE DRIPS AND RUNS IN THE FINISH WHERE THEY ARE NOT NOTICABLE.",Neutral
"It is what it is, a laser carved 1/8 thick wooden key. I don’t know why I was expecting more, but I was.",Neutral
"Super cute bag, but the zipper gets stuck a lot, it doesn’t slide as well as I was hoping. Besides that, the material of the bag is nice, and the print on the bag looks nice as well.",Neutral
It broke in half the second I got it. It's nice though. I just glued it together. Not worth the price. Can get cheaper at Michaels or Joanne's.,Neutral
Thinner material than I expected ... price too high for the lack of quality,Neutral
Good quality the only<br />one complaint. I ordered a 7 and received a 10,Neutral
Love the wording. But the board is slightly bowed.,Neutral
"Loved the size, weight and the thickness of these hoops. However, they are not 14k gold. Within a few hours, my ears were red and 2 of my piercings were itchy and bloody. I had high hopes for these. Save your money.",Neutral
I’ve purchased 2 of these and both times the stone falls off the rope. Bummer.,Neutral
"Great stickers for keeping track of routines.  The shipping time was super long so if you need something ASAP, i recommend finding something else.",Neutral
The softness and durability of this quilt is exceptional BUT the stitching stated at both long ends and ended in the middle with long strings unsecured as if someone forgot to tie them off.  I had to spend the time tying them before washing to make sure the stitching would not come apart in the wash.  If it was finished then 5 stars!,Neutral
"The pros are that it came SUPER fast, and it's very detailed and unique. The cons are that it feels kinda cheap, it's very thin and the edges are a little pokey, not very substantial, I feel like I could snap it in half really easily. It's for sure not worth the price, especially when it costs extra to add a chain, which is just ridiculous. I'm still gonna wear it, but I was kind of hoping for more from this necklace.",Neutral
"Pretty, but stains your skin green.",Neutral
Wish it was BIGGER and maybe even all parts working. Craftsman ship is good.,Neutral
"Not what I expected, it’s very very small and the chain is plastic, something you’d get out of a bubble gum machine.<br />I bought this for my daughter in law and was embarrassed to give it to her.<br />For the money I spent, I expected something a little more, had so many other options to buy from other vendors, I regret buying from this one and would not recommend.",Neutral
I liked the colour and the font. I did not like how easily the lettering was erased. I cannot touch the bottles constantly as the letters will be rubbed off. This is very disappointing.,Neutral
"The letters of this decal are very nice. The problem is with the installation. I followed the instructions but the letters stuck to the backing and not the clear mounting strip. I had to peel the letter off the backing, smooth out the bubbles and wrinkles, make sure they were aligned properly on the mounting strip, then stick on the letters. It took much longer than I expected but I think it looks nice for this chair I made for my grandson.",Neutral
Great idea for all the back ordered stuff.  The reel won’t last to long. So I have decided to keep it to the side for the idea and to show. More as a gag gift.,Neutral
They only send 1 key chain EVEN though it is for a COuples 2nd Anniversary....what are they supposed to do take turns...NOW i am forced to purchase a 2nd one ......I have bought many a Anniversary gifts in the past I haVE ALWAYS RECIEVED 2 ITEMS SO THAT EACH PERSON hUSBAND AND wiFE CAN HAVE A ITEM CELEBRATING THEIR ANNIVERSARY<br />tHE KEY CHAIN IS NICE AND SMALL.....HOWEVER for 20 bucks there should have been 2 in the package,Neutral
"Adorable, but smaller than expected. Letters very close together and thin. Really needs to have a backing of some kind to be able to read it,  Sister in law loved it tho!",Neutral
"I love the look, but the loop that the cord runs through to hang it has a rough edge that is causing the cord to fray. Otherwise it's a nice piece.",Neutral
very difficult to read the phone number because its on the edge of the disc.,Neutral
"The piece is itself is quite beautiful.  The chain is more flimsy than I would have expected.  Even worse it came tangled.  This piece is intended as a gift.  Luckily, I opened the box to check it before giving it.  It would have been very embarrassing to give a gift that was unusable.  I had to spend 30 minutes untangling it and wasn't even sure I would be able to.  This experience was very annoying.",Neutral
Words faded very quickly,Neutral
Package should have words &#34;photo - DO NOT BEND. Postman stuffed into mailbox. Fortunately they were OK but could've been ruined.,Neutral
This doesn’t smell like the orange groves in Soaring over California at all.,Neutral
super cute just very hard to tighten on your own,Neutral

Too small a stone,Neutral
Not as good of quality as hoped but cute and a good gift.,Neutral
"Cute but lettering fades, used clear nail polish to prevent, do not wear in the shower. And the ring is of bulky size, not an everyday wear for me but a fav piece of jewelry",Neutral

It's definitely handmade and cleans super well anf doesn't feel sticky or soapy residue . It smells nice but not very much. The perfume does last for a while and it's not an overwhelming scent which I like.,Neutral
Can hardly see the dandelion seed.,Neutral
This bunny is very cute. The stitching is beautifully done. Our little one loves her bunny. However I have Amazon Prime and it said it would be delivered March 22nd but it didn’t arrive until April 4th.,Neutral
"I like the look of the earrings, although they were smaller than anticipated. The first time I wore them the blue part of earring had fallen off ~ not thinking I would find it. It was found and I reattached it ~ we shall see.",Neutral
The necklace is nice. It doesn’t tarnish or change colors but the pendant is really really small.,Neutral
Meh. Not worth the price.  $5 value max,Neutral
"Cute decal, and seems to be of good quality. It came with some nice directions for applying to a wall (also mentions car, but not laptop, even though the listing shows a picture of it on a laptop).<br /><br />The main problem is that the listing of the product is misleading: You get one line of 10 hearts, despite the picture of 10 lines of 10 hearts and the title saying (10). It implies that the &#34;Health Bar&#34; is one whole line - I mean, really, a health bar is a unit of multiple hearts! - and that I'm getting 10 bars. I'm very disappointed at the price, considering this. I thought the price was fair for 10 lines, but wouldn't have ordered it if I had understood the listing properly.<br /><br />Still cute and glad to have it on my laptop.",Neutral
"I didn’t love the scent, there’s got to be something better",Neutral
"I like the ring in general, but noticed that its turning my nose green/grey.  I know it's not sterling silver, so unfortunately I ""wasted"" my money.<br />No bad things to say about seller or product itself. This is buyer's remorse.",Neutral
Not what I was expecting. Kind of bulky looking.,Neutral
it's o.k. but not as pretty as I thought it looked online,Neutral
"Although the 2 shirt colors look like they would match from the pictures, they are very different. One is a dark grey and the other is a triblend looking super dark gray, almost black.",Neutral
"The bracelet was beautiful.  Loved it.  Special for a friend who married us on a small Greek Island.  He loved it and put it on immediately.  He noticed that it unsnapped easily, but did not think it would be lost the very first time.  Wanted to replace it, but it's too expensive just to order a new one.  Be careful of the snap!",Neutral
I changed the letter J from blue to gray and the seller acknowledged the change but it still came in blue.,Neutral
Cute but flimsy,Neutral
"Cute case and fits the phone well.  HOWEVER, the buttons on sides of phone are covered, and the case makes it hard to use the buttons.  Pain in the neck having to take case off to use those buttons.",Neutral
"I heard a lot about the love don’t be shy, but it wasn’t for me. The seller sent the product and it ended up coming way faster than expected by 3 days. It was packaged well and didn’t leak. I will shop around for something else for sure.",Neutral
"It was not what I thought,they dont look like the photos",Neutral
nice but stone is small,Neutral
More yellow gold than shown in picture and also much smaller,Neutral
I have bought two different sizes in this style and find that the 3/4 in is a little hard to put on.,Neutral
Really liked it and it was pretty but way too fragile. Barely caught on my sleeve and the chain broke.,Neutral
I ordered the letter D and it looks weird. Not like a D.,Neutral
too many days to delivery but the product is nice,Neutral
"It came in perfect timely manor but I hate how small it is. I honestly thought it was going to be a bit bigger, for the price I paid...",Neutral
I was surprised to see the tiny little bag these came in. There doesn’t seem to be 100 in there. Maybe they can be made thicker to give the buyer more quality for the price. I do hope they will spread out enough to make a fun addition,Neutral
"Cute sign, but it'll probably rot because stake is wood.",Neutral
"Smells kind of weird<br /><br />It doesn't smell like lemongrass to me<br /><br />I don't like it<br /><br />Sorry<br /><br />:/<br /><br />The packaging and everything is very professional, though<br /><br />I just didn't like it as much as I thought it was<br /><br />It still works fine as a spray though",Neutral
I had hoped this to look more professional,Neutral
Smell is amazing but had to use 2 cubes to get the smell to travel and even then it wasn't far. Other than that they are great!,Neutral
"These galvanized lids look great with mason jars. I use for dispensing dishwashing soap and hand soap. Unfortunately they starting rusting quite soon. In addition, one of the lids didn't screw on smoothly, always skewed and have to be pried off. They work fine otherwise.",Neutral
"Nice item. Not worth the price. I gave 3 stars, because it looks like picture. Wish metal was heavier.",Neutral
"The paper was NOT an actual vintage dictionary page - it was a PHOTOCOPY of a dictionary page on modern cream colored paper. So the vintage feel and look of a real dictionary page was missing but the illustration copied onto it was well done, so that's why I'm giving it three stars.",Neutral
Wasn't what I thought the picture was way too small !!,Neutral
The map didn't represent the state they live in. That was very disappointing. The map looked random.,Neutral
Looks really good packaging was nice but it is not durable it gets really dirty and really hard to clean and when you do clean it does not dry back to its original color if you can maintain it it’s a real good purchase.,Neutral
"My husband likes this so far and hopefully it will keep his things together.  I have to say that I was disappointed for the price. The wood is essentially very light plywood and not very substantial. If he just has his phone on top (heavy case) it will tip over. The personalization also isn't as dark and doesn't stand out as much as I would like. It's personalized, so we have it, but it's not as I expected.",Neutral
Smaller than we thought...,Neutral
Was so small,Neutral
The charm could be bigger.,Neutral
It’s not as pretty as it looks in the picture and the chain looks cheep,Neutral
The print quality of these is not good at all. I am glad I put them in a place where people can not view them up close. The images look very distorted.,Neutral
"This is such an adorable idea, I love the concept, but the execution was off. The image was pixelated and the colors were too light and bright. It served its purpose fine, but the quality wasn't what I had expected.",Neutral

After a bad bleaching experience I’ve been trying some natural alternatives to maintain the protein treatment (and keep my hair from breaking so easily)<br />It did seem to help some but it didn’t feel nice to have in my hair. So I would leave it in overnight and wash my hair in the morning.<br />Overall it was okay. Not something I would buy again.,Neutral
Not as sturdy as expected and easy to bend.,Neutral
"Disappointed In the material. It came in dented on two sides. It is a very thin I’m not Sturdy at all. I will keep it because I like the way it came out, but I don’t like that it bends to easily. It probably got tweaked in the mailing process, but they really should have reinforced it. It’s kind of a sore thumb when I put it up, but it’s too much of a hassle to return.",Neutral

It’s super cute but the metal bends very easily and the stone was way smaller than anticipated.,Neutral
Large earrings,Neutral
It was pretty but so small. Wished it was a bit bigger.,Neutral
I wanted the pink that is shown on the website.  The one I got is very barely the palest of pinks.  I’m sending it back,Neutral
No es grande como muestra en la foto,Neutral
"Definitely not Druzy, and I really wouldn't describe them as faux druzy either, but I knew they were more of a colored nugget type appearance when I ordered them, so they came as expected. Very pretty! My only complaint is the earrings are two very different colors. One is copper colored and one is rose gold. A great value if you're looking for something inexpensive to wear daily.",Neutral
It's cool but kind of expensive for a sticker. Came on time!,Neutral
Went perfect with socks and gown,Neutral
A bit pricey for what it is.,Neutral
"When I first ordered the nose ring it was silver. After a month of wearing it, 4 of the 5 balls has turned a different color (3 purple ,1 blue) so that tells me they aren’t real silver. The loop it self is still silver with black spots (not real silver)",Neutral
Okay,Neutral
"This came quicker than the seller estimated - so that was nice - especially once I got the box and saw it had shipped directly from Thailand. (Right now, getting shipments in a timely manner just within the States takes longer!)  The flowers definitely don’t look as nice as they are pictured  on Amazon but they’ll do I guess.",Neutral
These faux nose rings hurt slightly while you have them on. They're not as comfortable as I hoped.,Neutral
The fact that I was sold a broken superglued back together pendant really blew my mind. VERY NOTICABLE<br />THAT'S NOT COOL,Neutral
"Very pretty and dainty necklace, however, the clasp is a little too long.",Neutral
Ok cute not worth full price,Neutral
Thought these were more of an off white. They are really taupe with brown stems. Cute design but doesn't match the aesthetic I wanted,Neutral
"A really nice vertical address plaque.  Arrived way ahead of predicted delivery time, which was great.<br />And, despite earlier reviews, the raised numbers were in pristine condition.  Unfortunately, it arrived with a large, semicircular scrape on the HDPE backboard.  I would love to just get a new backboard and attached it myself.  Will see if they will do that.",Neutral

"This was such a cute gift for my best friend and her home, but unfortunately the writing on it faded extremely fast. I gave it to her for Christmas and by the end of January it had faded and was illegible.",Neutral
I love how these look but the towels fall off easily over a day or two,Neutral
idk i get custom made nails on etsy all the time and i wear a size large these things are huge too big never had this issue and i use large with all sellers on etsy i purchase from,Neutral
It holds your items in place,Neutral
Delicate and beautiful but plated finish wears off after about 2-3 months of wear.,Neutral
The lid of the iPod case doesn’t sit firmly in the lid of the cover. You end up having to ope 2 kids every time you need to open it,Neutral
A little more Attention to detail for the cost.  I had to sand edges and put on extra coats of sealant for outdoor use.,Neutral
Pegs go straight out with no upward hook to put any kind of resistance on the peg board,Neutral
"In the picture shows 2 butterflies but it only came with one, a very small one. Also the entire decal is extremely small. I'm not please with the size at all. For the price I paid the size was too small. I'm very disappointed with it. I would never buy from this seller again.",Neutral
Pretty decor,Neutral
Absolutely adorable but the s’more fell off after one wear :(,Neutral
A very thoughtful gift from my husband. Fragrances are nice and strong. The bath bomb and salts could've been more strongly scented though. Looking forward to trying the rest!,Neutral
"I want to be clear for most people this bracelet will probably work great. It is very comfortable to wear. The clasp slides together and apart pretty easily. I had no issues doing this one handed. Here are the issues I had. I work in food service so lots of repeated motions and moving around. This bracelet came off a number of times while working. sometimes I would bump the clasp just right to pop it off or I was stocking things and would shake it loose. There are lost of cases I can see this not being an issue. maybe an office job or going to school, probably wont have it fall off as often or at all.",Neutral
"This was a little bigger than I expected and I don't like how I had to close it around my stethoscope. The ends don't meet up, they overlap. It's still cute though!",Neutral
"I love the stickers, you can't write on them without the smearing mess the ink  never dries. However I did find a pen to use without ink smearing making a mess.  Will I buy again maybe not. Due to the ink never drying. Trust the reviews",Neutral
Cute but wish it was bigger,Neutral
"Within a month the little sparkles had tarnished and we're brown. Tried everything to restore sparkle to no avail. Nice chain, but that's all.",Neutral
"So so, plastic, can't read the writing, have to put another color on it.",Neutral
This necklace had a scratch on the front and the piece that hold the bar onto the chain are not big enough so it flips upside down. Came in a tiny plastic bag... Not the best look. Its too late to return before my last daughters birth or I'd return and buy from a different lender(sister is my doula!),Neutral
Great quality prints. A little more orange in person than what I had anticipated so I’m not 100% sure I’ll use them,Neutral
"I was thinking whipped soap, sounds lovely. Until I used it. The soap clumps & is not whipped. Doesn’t melt well or lather up easily. I take showers and pieces of “whipped” soap was falling on the floor. On a positive note, the scent is intoxicating. It just doesn’t last very long.",Neutral
Hopefully it will be okay once framed.,Neutral
It is an adorable sign.  Little expensive for it's size and quality.  Shipped in a bubble wrap envelop so had 2 Knicks in it when it arrived.  Looks nice in my kitchen.,Neutral
They don't really sparkle much. I received the larger size and its still a little small for me. Would be good for a second or third hole. The screw on back is a nice feature and would be great for little ones so they don't take the earring out by accident.,Neutral
"Item is a nice idea but lettering was off-center and slanted downward. There is also a typo. No period after ""no matter what"". I had to add a period with a permanent marker so that it reads properly.",Neutral
Very nice colorful lively moonstone. Not sure what a $700 band should be. This one is very thin.,Neutral
"Scent is amazing, box is super cute and I would’ve given a higher review if everything that was supposed to be in the box was there. Unfortunately there was a missing item (bath bomb).",Neutral
WAZZUP w/ wrong description of paper vs metal backing????  A FLIMSIER BACKING DESERVES A LOWER PRICE.,Neutral
nice braceletbut very small. No way it could fit a man..I can barely get it on my wrist. very disappointing.,Neutral
They were cute. I wore them in the shower and the leaf parts came off.  So don’t get them wet. Other than that they were cute.,Neutral
I was surprised how tiny these were!,Neutral
Not strong enough. Smelled good in package but scent did not last long. I will go back to calidascope brand.,Neutral
"I like the concept and the ingredients, but I'm still working on trying to rinse it all out so that my hair doesn't look greasy when it dries.",Neutral
Cute gift,Neutral
"The poster is beautiful, but it is not a sign and the wording is not what I ordered. I ordered 'Welcome to our Wedding' but I received 'Welcome to our Beginning'. Don't have time to change it, so will make do.",Neutral
"I’m not sure how much it is me vs the quality of vinyl/transfer paper but this application couldn’t have gone worse had I tried. The stripes went on flawlessly, the stars are an utter disaster. Nothing but creases throughout the entire star field. I’ve installed vinyl in the past without any issues. This was the worst application I’ve ever had. Nothing like having to scrape off a brand new decal. 3 stars simply because I could 100% be at fault here, I don’t know why it went so poorly.",Neutral
Too small,Neutral
"Calidad standar y tienes que darle ciertos cuidados para que dure la tela, cómoda y ligera.",Neutral
"This is NOT good for even slightly textured walls. We just spent over three hours trying to apply these, most have torn, have air bubbles or applied very crooked. They were popping off the wall in places I fill like this should have been mentioned in the product description and I would have by-passed all together. Very unhappy that I just wasted $75. Fuming!<br />Update: Adjusted my rating because the company has great customer service. Stickers are super cute but I still don’t suggest for textured walls.",Neutral
a bit expensive for item,Neutral
"The printing is not vivid and not well defined and the fabric is very light weight and so I will have to wear a camo or sports bra under it so I don't feel like I have a see-through shirt on.  I will not be wearing it often, but it is a great walk down memory lane and I love that I see it in my drawer.  I have collected all the raisins figures and still love the song.",Neutral
"First of all, I want to start off by saying that the energy of this orgone is AMAZING! The moonstones are real! I really love moonstone and it’s energy, when I first received it and opened the box, I layed down and closed my eyes as I unboxed it, using sense of touch. I then placed the the pyramid over my third eye and just breath in it’s energy, for about 30 seconds. Then I held the pyramid in my left hand, I am right handed, but I did what felt right. I began to meditate with it, I wanted to feel it’s energy, for what it is, and not judge it based on how it looks, if it’s sloppy made or something is not straight or any of that, that doesn’t really matter if your buying this for a metaphysical purpose. Don’t forget why you’re buying it! Is it to look cool or pretty, or do you want to receive the benefits of a pyramid in your life ?<br />As, I began to meditate with it, I can feel a big vibration of energy! I felt as if my body was being filled with this energy and as it got down in my legs and to my toes it made my toes twitch, and move where I wasn’t doing that! I just remained calm and welcomed the energy. The experience was amazing! The energy was throbbing in my hand as I held it. When I was done with my meditation I thanked it and it made me smile I felt so happy, I gently opened my eyes and took a look at it. Right away I was able to tell the moonstone was real, I was surprised with how big the clear quartz was. Another thing I noticed was the quality of the resin. I compared this to 2 other pyramids I purchased. One, was cheaper in price, the other one, I believe is a competitor to evervibes, and the particular orogone that I bought from the competitive brand was more expensive than this one, yet, the resin felt the cheapest out of the 3!<br />The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is because it is really disappointing to me that the copper they use if fake. I took pictures of the spring wrapped around the clear quartz and you can definitely see discoloration, as if it was painted to look like copper. That is really upsetting, because of what you pay for an orgone like this, you pay for genuine stone and you trust that the company would deliver on that and on claiming they use “copper” not copper color wire, which takes from the metaphysical benefits, that some of us really care about.<br />Aside from that, I could not return this item because it’s energy is too beautiful and positive, I have meditated a couple other times with it, like I did when I first received it, and every time, I feel the throbbing sensation in my hand that holds it and every time I feel a pull of energy all the way down to my toes, this is some powerful stuff here! I keep next to where I sleep and sometimes hold it to fall asleep and then I’ll put it back on my nightstand once I catch myself sleeping and it had changed my dreams. I have been able to correlate them more and understand my subconscious more, of why I’m having certain dreams and I’m intuitively able to interpret them, it’s a little crazy! But, I know it’s the moonstone aiding my intuition.<br />So, if you want the real vibe and experience of a moonstone orgone, and you don’t care about not having the copper benefits, this is it! You won’t regret it. I know I don’t! But, nobody likes feeling cheated either.<br />I personally wouldn’t gift this, since the copper is so obvious that is not real and also, if you look at the picture I posted of the bottom of the pyramid and you look at the logo of evervibes you can see that the “e” first letter of the brand fell off, this happened quite early since I got it, maybe 3 weeks in. But, I do hold it a lot in my sleep and place the bottom on my forehead for a minute each night, so it can be that also.",Neutral
looks fine. was going to put this on my laptop but i can't use it because its too big. my bad,Neutral
Nice but strap is very cheap and not convenient to put on.,Neutral
To expensive for a print off lol this,Neutral
"I was disappointed in the size - they are tiny - but my own fault because I neglected to look at the size and only looked at the picture. The picture makes them look larger than they are. Also a bit ""flat"" for a moonstone. None of that flash that makes moonstones so pretty.",Neutral
"This necklace is tiny. It’s so delicate and the chain is way too short. Cute though, just wish the chain wasn’t so short like a choker necklace.",Neutral
Blue topaz instead of aquamarine color. Besides that I like the ring design.,Neutral
I thought the lettering would be bigger but it’s okay,Neutral
Cute but dunno if it’s worth the money,Neutral
Bought as gift.  Should have just bought something from Target that looked nicer and cost less.,Neutral
It’s cute but beware it comes with no frame so it’s literally a sheet of paper,Neutral
I was really disappointed in this.  It's just a heavier gauge of paper that it's printed on.  Not really worth the price.  I'll keep it but keep shopping around for better quality.,Neutral
I really like how the soap feels. It's got a nice gently exfoliating feeling to it. The only thing I don't really like is the smell. To me it smells like generic hotel soap.,Neutral
"I had a note with one and it wasn’t in it, the color of one box was wrong. It was orange when i asked for red. Came earlier than expected tho.",Neutral
"The stone looks nothing like the pictured stone. The pictured stone is shiny with a greenish luminescent hue. The stone I received is completely gray, it has the correct name on the package but doesn’t seem like the correct stone type. The stone is also pretty small.",Neutral

"I’ve bought a few of this companies’ products and was very impressed each time. Unfortunately it seems they fell a bit short this time. The ring doesn’t have the heft of the others I’ve gotten and isn’t nearly as dense. The design is nice and detailed, but the ring itself is just too thin for my liking.",Neutral

"I'm mad at myself for not noticing the details.....the donkey Kong is great, even though not exact to game very close....the pacman though is a bummer. The course is not right with the 1980 on the top and the ghost do not have the correct bottoms to them. Also the dark blue course blends in with the black a little too much for a wall picture. I knew I wouldn't use the pacgirl one with 2 boys but it looks better then the pacman orginal one...bummed out not more to the details for me. But have them in my kiddos bathroom for fun images.",Neutral
As expected,Neutral
"This ring was a little small. And it was not well finish. But to me is difficult to return it. I will keep it. Sincerely,",Neutral
Just smaller than I had hoped. The color isn't very good just a light green no other green color at all .My necklace has multiple green.,Neutral
"She loved it.<br />It was on a sturdy stainless steel chain, and the crystal was set securely in what liked like a stateless steel tear shaped setting.",Neutral

It took over6 weeks for this item to arrive & I feels that the puzzle is not worth what I paid,Neutral
"Didn’t like how the font is just vinyl stuck on that u could likely easily peel off. I’ve never seen a shirt like this, must be super home made",Neutral
"It is as pictured. The material is very thin and the zipper doesn’t look too sturdy. I honestly don’t think it will last long. Aside from the material of choice, it is otherwise made well. All seams are sewn well. There are no loose stitches and it functions as intended.",Neutral
"I really want to give it 5 stars. I ordered this for my sister for her birthday. The overall quality of the product is great. It arrived in a timely manner. Nothing was misspelled. However, the placement of where I wanted things was off. I ordered ""Fierce"" on the top and then her birthday in Roman numerals on the side. When it arrived, it was engraved top and bottom. So you could only see one of them when it's being worn. I was really disappointed with that! I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and waiting for a new one that MIGHT have turned out right, so I just gave it to her anyway. She has super sensitive skin and she has had zero issues with the metal making her break out.",Neutral
Much smaller than expected .,Neutral
Really was beautiful but unfortunately on of the read beads on the wings was missing. It tests my OCD.,Neutral
The writing look nothing like the picture. You have to turn it different ways towards a light just to read it doesn’t have bold black print like that add,Neutral
It was ok but but the quality expected.,Neutral
Shirt for as expected but the fabric was very thin and stretched as I wore it.,Neutral
"Is green, not blue as listed. Does not match necklace since it is not blue. Still very cute but not what was expected.",Neutral
The clip is a little difficult to snap to your jacket or scrub top. The badge real is also a little hard to get your tags on due to the type of clip it is but I do love the style and my name being on it.,Neutral
"Love the saying and the palm size of the sticker, put the sticker is very sticky on the face of it for some reason.  No matter how many times I wash my water bottle the sticker is always sticky. Otherwise, the saying is great and the size!",Neutral
Very cute but tarnished quickly and loses its shine.,Neutral
"These earrings, while pretty, weren’t worth the time it took for them to arrive. I needed them for a time sensitive event months in advance and they barely arrived on time. They also don’t look exactly like the picture. I was expecting something that looked more vintage and aged like indicated in the picture—something more goth looking, which is which is the vibe I wanted for the memorial service I was planning to wear them to.",Neutral
Design was different than pictured.,Neutral
"I love wearing my gold filled necklaces. I have others from Amazon, different brand,  that do not fade to dark, this one sadly is darkening. However, if you’re wearing it on its own, probably better, I ordered it representing each one of my 5 kids, so there are five letters and it holds up great! Sits perfect and comfortably on my neck and does layer with other pieces.",Neutral
"For being cotton, these were very unabsorbant.",Neutral
Picture shows products blown up. Actually comes in like 5 x 5 box<br />Don’t make it look larger than it really is.,Neutral
Smells decent doesn't last real long no one has complemented me on the smells wish I could return but is past the time frame,Neutral
"The wood was very thin, when I held it up it was flemsy.  Made me nervous that it would break.  My husband is going to have to glue it to another piece of wood.  The lettering was just as described and beautiful.  Wish it had been a bit thicker.",Neutral
"It wasn’t the best but it wasn’t the worst, it was heavy so it kind of weighed my beard down and didn’t give me the style I was looking for.",Neutral
Charms seem to come off a little easier than one would aspect. Beautiful design.,Neutral
"I received this pendant today and put it on my own chain. I got it because the stone is the color that I've been wanting. There are blemishes on the silver around the stone. The bail that holds the pendant is silver but the material around the stone is gold tone or overlay of some sort. I didn't notice that it was different colors when I ordered it, or I wouldn't have. The stone is very pretty but I am not in love with the quality. I got the matching ring and same issues. I don't want to go thru the hassle of returning it and plan to wear it because it is pretty but I don't think this piece will offer much longevity.",Neutral
"Scratches easily, really bendable, which is good for many different sizes of wrists, but the problem is it's hard to bend back to the same shape",Neutral
weird fit,Neutral
"They were very nice, bur they didn't fit my ear I returned them and received a full refund. They were very gracious in the return policy no issues at all.",Neutral
Very irritating.. but its my nose,Neutral
Nothing wrong with them. It just that the pieces are larger in person then they look on the pictures. Thought they'd be smaller and more dainty but that's not the case.,Neutral
The patch is extremely flat and presses against the eye. After a lot of kneading the leather was softer but still had zero shape. I've bought leather patches before and knew it would be stiff but no amount of weasel make this item comfortable. The stud holding the strap is centered on the forehead. No getting around that. The adjustable strap was the only thing about it that I have no qualms with. The details were lightly etched into the leather and weren't easily seen but I'd rather have had nothing at all.,Neutral

I’m sure there are 50 in this bag but certainly wasn’t expecting such a tiny bag of gems. Shown with my sunglasses for comparison.,Neutral
Is very very small,Neutral
i gave it three stars because they don't remove easy and do tear very easily.,Neutral
In the picture they looked liked lever backs but they are not.,Neutral
Can’t see the animal when it’s on because it’s too small.,Neutral
"First, shipping was good, better than usual. The item itself is not bad but could be better but for the price, good. The stone is simulated and not very  reflective. The ring is fine, I've worn it for a few weeks and my skin hasn't turned so all good. I thought the ring would be more flashy but not so. All in all it's not a bad ring for everyday use just don't expect a lot of flash. Good buy for the money....",Neutral
Its a pretty  necklace but it broke within a week and made me breakout I missed the return time but even though I had not a great experience I would still recommend this item .,Neutral

"Posts are not too strong , fits purpose.",Neutral
"I like it, just wish it was more reasonably priced. I would buy more if it was",Neutral
The item was very cute but after wearing it twice the charm has already separated from the necklace. I wish the chain/connection was a little stronger. Now it just sits on display with my other Harry Potter stuff.,Neutral
The seller uses USPS so expect it to not arrive on time. If I knew they used USPS I wouldn't have bought. Item is just okay looking.,Neutral
This was too small it suits a baby.,Neutral
I like the look of the monogram but the letters were spaced out strangely. There is a strange gap in the letters. Ask for a proof first. Also took a long time to receive.,Neutral
Best for a fancy outfit. But they are super cute if you like fancy linger earrings.,Neutral
It's not what I expected. It's just a label glued on to a white board. Extremely disappointing for what I paid. I think half of the cost would be fair.,Neutral
"The quality of the shirt itself is pretty nice and runs a little fitted (Gildan Brand). I ordered one with a name and number, but instead I received it with just the name, and no number.

"Super cute. It was hard to find a gift for a Speech-Language Assistant, so this was cute, but after 3 months or so, the string broke.",Neutral
"Item arrived well packaged - a bit over packaged if I’m being honest, and came with a printed receipt and postcard sized thank you card, which was nice.<br /><br />Product itself however, looked like it had been printed on a home laser printer on low, grade copier paper. Colors themselves were also not very vivid.<br /><br />I purchased this item for reference when editing photographs and also for just having a handy at-a-glance guide for color coordinating around the home. It will provide me with the ability to do that, I just feel a bit short-changed given I paid $23 for a piece of poorly printed, laminated paper.<br /><br />Item cannot be returned either, so consider carefully before purchasing.",Neutral
Like the product but it was item shown was deceitful.  There was nothing to hang on as shown in the photo. Had to go buy one,Neutral
"This is a great clock that looks just like the photos BUT the minute hand is so off-kilter that the clock simply frustrates us since we often can't determine what time it is.  The tail end of the minute hand is so large and so long that it often looks like it's the hour marker.  It's so frustrating that we think we'll be looking into getting different hands from a hobby store to replace them.  This is really  a shame since we loved the personalization, color, size, etc.",Neutral
cute shirt lots of glitter but the shipping was long.,Neutral
"I have been purchasing these to use as covers for the back panel of an inexpensive bookcase to give it a fun twist. For my purposes it is fine, but some are real dictionary pages, and some are photos (several are copies of the exact same page).  I ended up laminating the actual dictionary pages to match the sheen of the ones that are photos. Just be aware when you after that you will most likely be receiving photo. Like I said, it works for what I want.",Neutral
"It is what it is. Not a forever piece of jewelry, definitely for a younger teen to enjoy and eventually set aside for more grown up stuff. So for it's ""Sweet 16"" purpose, it is fun. If it gets lost no big deal. If it tarnishes no big deal. Cute and well made. I only wish we had a choice in the stone because I would've liked her birthstone, so, I did have to go on my own to replace the pearl with the correct birthstone, which brought the final price paid quite higher than I really wanted to pay for a gift to someone's child whom I hardly know.  It make sense to me if it's a ""Sweet 16"" it should most definitely come with the choice of a birthstone.",Neutral
Loved the cuteness of the ornament but did not like that a piece broke off as soon it came off the tree.,Neutral
I love them! They stay in place all day.,Neutral
Dislikes the letters for the family names - I wish they letters had been block style and more legible,Neutral
It was late. The seller gave me the run around but I finally got it.,Neutral

"I wanted to love these earrings. I had the perfect outfit for the holidays to wear them with. Unfortunately, the set I received didn’t match. One has more wood and the other has more yellow resin (see pic). I know these are handmade so I wasn’t expecting perfection but these are more than a 1/4th of the inch off from each other. It looks funny to me so I’ll be returning them. I wish mine had looked more like the seller’s picture. I’m so disappointed.",Neutral
"The brownie’s are adorable. I was expecting more of a cocoa smell. The packaging sorta smears the wax melts which I don’t really like. I mean, wax melts aren’t the cheapest.

"It's a beautiful mini ""print"" of a painting.<br />Yes, it's signed and numbered.<br />Disappointed in the size, looks much larger on site.",Neutral
"My husband loves the ring. However, the gold veins are breaking out in little bits. It should probably be removed whenever doing any kind of work. He'd like it better if it were filled in behind the stone, as it would be much more comfortable, but the price would have been more.",Neutral
Have to get address to return,Neutral
Printed on photo paper and was a little blurry and difficult to read. I was hoping for something nicer than I could have done myself. We ended up not even using this for my child's military going away party. I wouldn't recommend. Maybe the seller should consider switching to a high quality cardstock.,Neutral
"Eh, these are just okay.  They are smaller than expected (which is my fault for not reading the measurements) and feel cheaply made.  They also arrived with a strange (and not natural) odor.  I will be returning.",Neutral
Love the design and fabric! But I'm not impressed with the zipper. It's very cheaply made and makes it extremely hard to open the bag. I wouldn't be surprised if it  breaks after a couple times of use. If it was made with a better zipper I would have given it 5 stars.,Neutral

"THIS METAL IS THINNER THEN DOLLAR TREE METAL SIGNS AND IS NOT MADE OF QUALITY METAL!!<br />It arrived quickly in a very thin flat box. Some edging of words are not only sharp enough to get you some stitches, but a piece was actually bend upwards.. (hey makers... thanks, I missed the ER, 1st time stitches were horrid). It could've been avoided by the makers simple act of flattening this LITTLE MORE THAN PAPER THIN metal.<br /> I am just not pleased with this product.  The cutting machine is off a little and leaves jagged edges, which wasn't mentioned that it would be this way on every cut their machine made.<br /> I wanted to like it, but when it hit the floor, it gave a bit and bent a tad now won't lay flush with wall. Smh, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Don't be like me trying to save an extra 10.00s, go ahead and buy better quality one.<br />DISAPPOINTED & DONT RECOMMEND!",Neutral
Every picture shows cute and mostly uniform. I got super awkward that will catch on everything. It is just not pretty like the pictures show.<br /> It is long and tall. Super weird shaped for uncut jewelry. I have uncut garnets and my grandparents made jewelry out of many stones. Not impressed.,Neutral
It is much smaller than pictured.,Neutral
It was smaller than expected and it smells VERY HEAVILY of cigarette smoke.,Neutral
This was a gift so once it was opened we discovered it was missing the white cord that makes the ‘web’ part and the needle in the packaging. My daughter still made it and liked it but I was disappointed with the incomplete package.,Neutral
I just thought for the price I paid that it would come on better paper and be better quality it looks like something I could print off from my printer,Neutral
"So so cute, but.... they literally fall out of my ears. The weight of the dangle robot is too much and they just tip out. I love them though, I may try to make a necklace out of them.",Neutral
"It’s a pretty sign but via the picture in the listing I was expecting a white sign, not a dark metal sign..... I guess I can paint it myself.",Neutral
Even though shipping to a while when I received the item I was so in love. i also love the little nose jewelry box it was sent in. I love wearing different nose rings rather then standard ones and I was happy to fine a couple on Amazon. How ever I'm disappointed because I've only had the nose ring in for 1-2 weeks and all of the stones fell out. When I change my rings I like to wear then for months before changing to another but since this has happened I have to take it out. Would I purchase again ? No because 'm afraid the stones will fall out again and to me it was a waste of my money. I do hope the seller fix this issue.,Neutral
"I really wanted to like this potentially cute little, genuine leather bag, but I was disappointed in the look of the leather.<br />Pros:<br />1) genuine leather--smells good, feels real.<br />2) Good size if you just want to carry a phone and minimalist wallet<br />3) very nice, swivel, high-quality clips for strap<br />4) Could work for men or women who want a small/non-bulky pouch for essentials.<br />Cons:<br />1) The leather on the face of the bad just looks....ugly to me.  See pic 1 and 2. The colors of the different pieces are not a great match, the place where the snap is has a lump and looks kind of cheap or worn.... and the overall look of the front is, to me, kind of ugly rather than the pleasingly distressed look that leather can develop and was hoping for.  Possibly, with time and use, we will get a nicer patina and it will look more integrated and attractive.  I may also try some mink oil to even out the shades.  If any of this works over time, I will update review and add a star.<br />2) Given the disappointing appearance of the bag, I think it is priced too high.",Neutral
Needs to have a thicker material used.,Neutral
These are nice images. They look as they appear in the pictures. The seller did a good job of advertising by adding a drop-shadow that gives them the appearance of being mounted but be aware that these are just PRINTS on glossy cardstock.<br /><br />it's easy enough to go to a craft store and mount them on some balsa wood or something like that. They'll look nice in my daughter's beach themed room.,Neutral
Too dark. Seems that the flowers were too thick. It looks black.,Neutral
Zipper broke after a couple months other then that good quality,Neutral
"Franchise items are usually more money, but not always with it.",Neutral
UM...  WAY SMALL,Neutral
"The product smells nice, but the color of the liquid is not as advertised. It is a yellowish green, not a clear to blush pink color.",Neutral
The bracelet is pretty and came very fast in a very nice gift box. The downside is there is no insert to explain what kind of stones the bracelet is made of which would be nice considering this is a gift.  I thought the engraving would look like the picture of the bracelet that I ordered but instead it was a black letter M — nota cursive M in silver.  It’s confusing when ordering- you aren’t sure exactly which bracelet is which and what you are ordering. It could definitely be more clear.,Neutral
I got this for my boyfriend during Christmas. I thought the garnets would be bigger in size and a little looser. Sadly it’s snug around his wrist but it’s still noticeable and he liked up. Hopefully overtime it’ll loosen up.,Neutral
Smaller than advertised. Other than that they do their job as expected.,Neutral
"I was a little disappointed in the ""T"" monogram. It's so curly you can't tell what letter it is. The wreath itself it lovely.",Neutral
"I've been wanting to purchase a grasshopper keychain for a while to remind me that ""I'm not a grasshopper"".  I saw this keychain on Amazon and love the hand stamped, rustic look of the item.  The description reads ""Grasshopper charm keychain with HAND STAMPTED initial"".  As you can tell from the photo I attached the initial is NOT hand stamped.  The initial piece isn't even the same piece that was shown in the listing photo.  It makes the keychain look cheaper and not as nice.  The initial piece is a smooth, mirrored piece of metal with a a ""T"" printed on it.  I would not have been willing to pay what I paid for this unit, it I had seen it as it really is.  I will be writing to Amazon to see about getting a partial or full refund.",Neutral
"A little pricey for the amount of gold used; they’re so tiny & fragile. I’m keeping them, but.....",Neutral
Looks cheap,Neutral
They're fine. But they're so small that you need to bend them to get them into your ears and it's almost impossible to bend them back once in.,Neutral
It was not as good as I thought,Neutral
"very upset. not what I expected, and I thought I would be a regular customer",Neutral
"This is a beautiful image.  Very nice.  Came in proper packaging with no bends.  I noticed when I pulled it from the sleeve it had a noticeable crease in the image.  It's only about 1.5 inches so I just kept it but it was unfortunate that it is there.  I wish the sender would have noticed it before they sent and gave me a different one.  I framed it anyhow but I always see the crease.  Bummer.  Still, beautiful image.",Neutral
Haven’t had a chance to wear it yet.,Neutral
Basic prints on thin matting,Neutral
Can barely read the engraving.,Neutral
No one in our family really liked it. The room you see in the photos for each item is really conjested.<br />It is not a solid wood. Feels like partical board with roughish edges. It does have the slits and spaces. So buy it if none of this matters to you.,Neutral
"They're also smaller than I expected,  the picture is close up..",Neutral
"It looks good and came very fast. But it's personalized it asks for the name so I put Brian like I needed.  But they didn't add the "" 's "" don't you think you would assume to put that?",Neutral
Writing looks fussy and is hard to read,Neutral
The initials look almost as nice as they do in picture. Rolls a bit on chain. Clasp keeps coming down to front. My chain broke first time toddler tugged on it. Ugh. I need toddler proof jewelry.,Neutral
the rings are very thin but okay.,Neutral
The card is nice but not really a card. Just a single piece of wood. Not a card like a birthday card or valentine card. Really my fault for not catching that fact....,Neutral
"Too small, hard to read, confusing",Neutral
"I love the look of the necklace, the charms are exactly how they are pictured! I hate to rate it 3 stars, but after a few days of wearing, the chain started turning colors and rubbing off on my neck. I wish a better chain was offered and the cost was raised, or the charms were sold on their own. Because now I can't wear it anymore until I buy a new chain.",Neutral
"Incomplete, missing the bean in one earring. :(",Neutral
Expensive for not being real obsidian,Neutral
It is much smaller than pictured.,Neutral
Too little,Neutral
"Tiny, tiny.  You cant even tell it's an opal.",Neutral
"This was such a nice puzzle for my MOH proposal but it came without the ""Maid of Honor"". They were very nice about replacing it and even delievering it to the person. They apologised but i fixed it and still got my refund.",Neutral
Kinda small thought be aa little better quality i could have printed iff internet for free,Neutral
"This puzzle was bought as a gift and is exactly what I ordered. The quality is amazing and the puzzle itself is great quality. My only complaint is that it came a month after it stated to be delivered. I even had to file a claim that it was not coming. Then one day it just showed up at my doorstep. I would order again, but be aware of long shipping times.",Neutral
I like that they are reusable and that the black won't show stains. I wish they were smaller and thicker.,Neutral
The image is fantastic but the execution of the image on a cheap piece of card stock is disappointing.  Am I supposed to frame that?,Neutral
"Not an even triangle, so it looks funny. I will not be wearing it unfortunately, wasted $",Neutral
"The decals are great, I wish I would have enlarged them on the screen to get a better look...  and maybe knew about the sellers website.  I see a few there I would have preferred...  but &#34;Scratched Metal&#34;, ???  I don't know.  They don't look metal at all, but the sizes and assortment do look pretty darn good in my boy's refinished bathroom...",Neutral
Not as red color as I needed,Neutral
"Honestly- cute concept- BUT it’s just a laminated print out on regular paper. I could’ve made this myself. Very cute concept- great idea - but it can be made at home.<br /><br />Pro- I didn’t have to make it 🤷🏻‍♀️ but for $9 plus s&h- Yiesh….<br /><br />Either way- 3 stars, because? Someone else made it & saved me from making it :)",Neutral
"I got these to use as cloth napkins, and they are great for that purpose. They clean up well in the washing machine. My only disappointment is that the edges fold in awkwardly on all but one of the towels after washing. I think if the stitching were a bit thicker around the edges, this problem could be prevented. As it is now, they really need to be ironed after each washing in order to look tidy, and that's not something I'm willing to do.",Neutral
Wasn’t what I expected. See through and thin. Not the greatest quality print.,Neutral
"Excellent product, way overpriced. It's a very little piece of cloth with the listened artwork on it. Way too experience.",Neutral
"The strap are thick and where they connect to the bracer they are really blocky and you can feel them digging into your wrist.  Worn on top of a sleeve it's not that bad, and they look pretty cool.  Wouldn't wear them without something underneath though.",Neutral
"I love the design of this tag and the quality seems exceptional.  The problem I have is the font is so small that the numbers for my phone are not clear.  The 3,5 & 8 are hard to distinguish.  I wish they would have let me know and then I would have ordered the larger tag.",Neutral
Cute photo for bathroom or something. I wasn’t expecting it to come on regular photo paper. I figured it would have come on canvas,Neutral
I like the look of this bag.  It was smaller than I thought.  I only use it when o go to work 3 times a week and the strap already broke.  Disappointed.,Neutral
"I like the ring in general, but noticed that its turning my nose green/grey.  I know it's not sterling silver, so unfortunately I ""wasted"" my money.<br />No bad things to say about seller or product itself. This is buyer's remorse.",Neutral
"I measured my ankles, but the ten-inch is way too large. I needed about a 9 inch or so. I decided not to return it because of the low price. Gave it to the wife who altered it and made herself a bracelet.",Neutral
for whatever reason it keeps turning around (entire necklace),Neutral
I liked it but the gold paint on the beans rubbed of and the beads look brownish. This happened first time I wore it!,Neutral
"Very nice and sturdy but a little tight for men size. Wished it's 1/2 "" longer.",Neutral
"This isn't a bad product. I like it, it's just the size is so small. Still noticeable a bit but tiny.",Neutral
"It looked great the first day I put it on but it didn't last 3 days before it started chipping. Also, the Matt look gets a little glossy after a day or 2.",Neutral
"This graphite object is well crafted, but delicate. When I draw I tend to press down hard on the object, in this case the Raven. The beak snapped off and I had to use super glue to put it back on. Design flaw makes it susseptable to break at the point between the head eye area and the beak. For the price I expected this to be sturdier quality.",Neutral
I didn't read the fine print. Pricey for what you get--a piece of paper.,Neutral
"These are really cute online but in person was disappointing. They looked faded, and not glittery. Ask for glossy print ahead of time. If they do it, it Would look so much better",Neutral
"Wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it is still pretty.",Neutral
Broke after only a couple times of wear,Neutral
The color in the picture is a lie. The only way to achieve that color is to paint over an orange. But I do love the color over a pumpkin orange! Also the wrapping was super sweet which was appreciated!<br />*I also added a topcoat,Neutral
I was really disappointed in this.  It's just a heavier gauge of paper that it's printed on.  Not really worth the price.  I'll keep it but keep shopping around for better quality.,Neutral
But it looks really delicate and fragile and its tinnnnnyyyy!,Neutral
"I like Happy Planners, but a little. Shocked that there were only 20 pages!. For a lot of $$?",Neutral
"Although I like them, there is not enough for the entire year.",Neutral
"Someone said I could request the initials engraved on the blade, but even with me letting them know. The gift arrived without the the initials being engraved. Which was a huge bummer!<br />Regardless it’s a great knife!",Neutral
IT WAS OK!,Neutral
It was smaller than expected.,Neutral
I like the bracelets very nice especially the tiger I part the part I didn't like was you can't distinguish the black obsidian from the black onyx,Neutral
Very cheap looking. Obviously someone just made and printed on a home computer and punched out and placed into plastic piece. Wouldn't recommend. Picture looks like they were running out of printer ink when printed.<br />Very Disappointed!,Neutral
Too much money,Neutral
"Overall, the design and graphics look good, but the outer perimeters of the sign show lots of imperfections in the metal and paint.<br />If this was not a Christmas gift to someone else, I would have returned it, but the recipient was satisfied.",Neutral
I was disappointed that the prints were on a card stock. The picture appears to have depth like a canvas painting. Very beautiful and packaged well for delivery. I should have read the reviews so it is my fault. I will purchase some frames for the prints to go in and I’m sure they will look great.,Neutral
"It hurts me to give this less than 5 starts because it’s so cute and seems well made, and I like that you can customize it. It’s my fault for purchasing it so I’m not looking for a refund, I just wish it was a breakaway collar. No one should put one that’s not on their cat. It’s so important. This came up in the search results when I searched “breakaway cat collar” so I didn’t read it well enough to find out it actually wasn’t.",Neutral
The speed to delivery was great<br /><br />The photo of the opal looked  considerably diffferent  in color more dark green,Neutral
Item was much smaller than expected!,Neutral
I didn't notice they were just rubber thongs when I ordered them.  The toe holder just kept pulling through the hole.,Neutral
"Great quality/wood, reasonable pricing, easy setup.<br />Two things I would change though.<br />1) It doesn’t lock tight. There is still a gap that lets the unit move.<br />2) Add a small hole to the bottom of the wood that you can run the charging cord under the unit and not around. Cleaner look.",Neutral
"While the print on the shirts is perfect, the shirts themselves are very thin and not likely to last more than a few washes. We had to order from a different company.",Neutral
They should give appropriate mounting bracked with it.,Neutral
"7/1/2018 - I just got the ring a couple of days ago. It took a while to arrive, but that was expected for a personalized item. The ring is VERY thin and has somewhat of a rough edge (not to cut yourself, but it feels like it could if you hit your finger the wrong way) I put a personal inscription on the ring (it appears on the outside of the ring) but it is so small I needed a magnifier to read it. I was hoping for a little better than what I received. It’s just okay and I’m not sure I would recommend this to anyone.",Neutral
Can’t really smell the patchouli.,Neutral
ear loops were very small-had to change.  I side material very very thick.  was difficult to breathe.,Neutral
I'm not happy but not disappointed. It's smaller than I anticipated but not by much but the stones are terrible. In the description they looked higher quality. They look like fish rocks.<br />I wouldn't have minded had I not spent $13 it's definitely not worth that.<br />The grid is printed on thin flimy card stock material and the rocks mine came with were tiny which I didn't mind much but I don't see how something tiny could break in half my picture it's hard to tell but one of the stones came broken too.<br />I am going to use this for an arts and craft project otherwise I would have returned it. If I would have liked this one I had my eye on the raven one. I'm going to just look into something better quality next time as I didn't feel this was worth what they charged.,Neutral
It really didn’t match up with the picture and I didn’t like the J on iy,Neutral
super cute but the chain broke after 4 days,Neutral
It is working fine. I do wish it were a bit longer and just a little wider so it can wrap a little better and provide more coverage.,Neutral
"Well made and very pretty. The only problem is that it smells like a petting zoo. Hoping the smell will eventually fade, but so far no luck after 3 months. Keep having to explain to people why why there is a goat farm smell in my living room.",Neutral
"I like the packaging the case came in. It was a very cute holographic pouch that included a sort of tether for the AirPods in case you do some strenuous activity and you don’t want to risk losing them (as easily at least). I will say I do also like the material the case is made of. It’s a thick pvc plastic material; It’s not a hard case, but it also isn’t completely loose. The fit on my case is nice. It’s very snug, but I haven’t tried taking it off for any reason. It might be such a tight fit that I could see it being very difficult to slide the AirPod case out without any struggle.<br />Now, reviewing the printed font on the front is what I have the most issue with. As you can tell from the pictures, it is very off center. My name is very far to the left and I feel like it throws the whole aesthetic completely off. It could’ve been a cute minimalistic case, but for those such as myself the off center name is all I see. I also don’t care too much for the actual font. It doesn’t seem as elegant as the pictures I saw, but I guess that’s just because my name doesn’t start with an ‘s’ or another less awkward letter lol. Overall the quality was nice but the personalization wasn’t what I expected.",Neutral
silver balls move around while you are wearing it.,Neutral
They’re pretty but too small. I’d rather pay a little more and get a substantial pair of earrings,Neutral
Colors fade quickly.,Neutral
I ordered thinking the frame was included. I was wrong. My fault on that part. It is expensive for a 12x18 sheet of paper and not good of quality.,Neutral
It' quite quite ~!,Neutral

I got the first whistle.  All it sounded like blowing air.  I asked the seller for an exchange.  New whistle arrived.  Sounds the same as the old whistle.<br /><br />Looks awesome though.,Neutral
"This was nice until it fell apart. The print was held in the frame with double-sided tape, until the tape let go. Now an empty frame is on the wall and the print is on the floor. It didn't last 2 years.",Neutral
"Decent quality but I picked this wall art because it's the only one that shows ""inhale"" and ""exhale"" on one print. I received two separate prints with one word on each, like all the other options on Amazon.",Neutral
The earring is really pretty but it wont stay in.  Unless I'm missing something will return it.,Neutral
We were out of the country for our wedding by the time it arrived and didn't get the chance to return it. so that was unfortunate for sure.,Neutral
mold is shallow..would have liked it to be deeper,Neutral
Value and product are similar.  The product did not arrive on the scheduled date.,Neutral
Item is nice but too expensive fir what it is.,Neutral
good,Neutral
The chain is nice but the metal around the stone is cheap and already rusting. The whole reason I paid for silver is so none of the necklace would rust. It’s a good stone but basically expect the sun part to start turning brown. Kind of a bummer,Neutral
"Although it's cute, this necklace/choker color is a tad bit off. The chain itself is of the same quality you'd get at H&M or Claires, meaning the longevity maybe questionable. Cute for a date night or two but, I wouldn't wear everyday.",Neutral
"Looks so cute, tarnished quite fast on the end that doesn’t loop into your actual piercing",Neutral

I like the texture of the sand. Good little bag that it comes in.,Neutral
"...is, so-so. Can't say anything was wrong with the design, but just was not a ""show stopper"". Wear it with multiple bracelets & it a nice accessory.",Neutral
Product is made out of very thin laminated wood. Not sure it will be sturdy enough for a child to play with.,Neutral
It was not as large as I thought it would be. Picture shows a larger one. Got a medium sized one.,Neutral
The box is nice they just sent me the wrong color,Neutral
I'm going to buy this for my fiance for Christmas because I don't care about gendered advertising. God some people.<br /><br />When i purchase it I will come back and rate the photo more accordingly.,Neutral
Cheap looking,Neutral
"These are more like 10mm honestly. I have had 8mm and 10mm before and the 8mm fit snug while the 10mm didn't. 😪  They look nice but am a little disappointed, to be honest. Shld have bought the 6mm... Which I actually wanted for another piercing, wish I had bought those first, instead of these.",Neutral

"This order includes three unscented lotion sticks. I gave these to my wife, and here is her review:  Because the top is flat and not rounded, there are a limited number of body parts where I can apply this until the stick gets worn down and rounded a bit on the edges. I applied this to the back of my hands, and then used my hands to finish rubbing it in. My hands stayed oily for a long time, which I didn't care for. I had other things to do, but didn't want to get oily prints all over everything I touched, so I basically took an unplanned break until the oiliness was gone. It seemed to take forever, but part of that was probably because I was impatient to get back to what I was working on. One strange result from this lotion stick was that it made my hands really wrinkly, especially around my thumbs. No idea why. I didn't see anything in the ingredient list that would explain it. It did leave my skin soft and moisturized, so I will use it until it's gone, but at this price, with the very slow absorption time, and with the oddball wrinkling effect, I don't want any more of it.",Neutral
"Cute necklace, very disappointed in the chain.",Neutral
The shirt is cute but it's definitely men's sizing. The description says Basketball Mom shirt so I assumed woman's sizing. Maybe that's my bad,Neutral
Overall I am disappointed with this product. Can barely tell that it should be and very thin. For the cost I would not recommend.,Neutral
"Like the title says, I'm only giving it 3 stars because this is my favorite scent for soaps/shampoos, but besides that, this actually gave me WAY more dandruff! I spotted using it after 2 weeks of using it. I switched to head & shoulders essential oils products and that started working within 3 days. I would not recommend this but i am just one person, it might work for other people.",Neutral
Way too small! only about 2/3 of my hair twisted in a bun would fit in it!,Neutral
"This cover looks very well made. Feels soft and ""rustic"", the leather is thick but pliable.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe the leather will form over time, but the pen loop prevents the cover to close evenly. Doesn't look good as it is right now. The pen loop is rather tight and will only fit very slim pens like Parker Jotter. Anything larger and you will have to force the pen in and out. I got ink on my fingers trying to work a Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen out of the loop and the cap came off instead.<br /><br />Also, the cover is quite a bit larger than the A6 notebook itself, but it has to be to fit a pen in the middle and not interfere with closing. Given that it actually does interfere still I find this design subpar...`",Neutral

This is an okay product. Packaged nicely for shipping. Had a scratch across the bottom of the cup upon opening. Seemed kind of cheaply made. Would not purchase again.,Neutral

I ordered 40 by 25 for over her queen size bed, her name is written in bubble gum with a gold metallic crown. My only issue was application, I waited the 48 hours as instructed and the thin lettering still peeled up and tore in a couple places. I love vinyl and have applied much thinner and more complicated pieces to my walls and a mirror with no tearing. I think my semi-gloss paint may have been part of the issue.",Neutral
"This purse is lightweight and looks great. However, I’m very, very doubtful that it is genuine leather. I have vast experience with leather clothes and accessories so I am  disappointed with this aspect. The overall quality seems to be in alignment with imported reproductions. But, it is lightweight. I’m actually only using it as a tote and lunchbox.<br />Purchase a ‘Nena’ instead. Great quality and an organization that truly supports local society what should be important in life.",Neutral

These earrings photograph well. They’re cute but I was underwhelmed by them in person. Design is not so polished up close. Look a little crafty.,Neutral
Muy buena calidad,Neutral
"smaller in width than the pictures shows.  screws on the bottom, I personally didn't like it. maybe someone else may like.  I am glad  I only ordered two first than the six I was going to.  it would been great if they were actually wider in the width and no screws in the bottom .  other than this they look good but not for what I need them for.",Neutral

"The glass itself is beautiful and flawless. It's not too heavy so it won't bend the branch too much. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the writing itself was actually really hard to read, and that's the whole point of this ornament..",Neutral
Very pretty and looks just like the photo however the backs don’t stay on for me I have to use backs that did not come standard with these.,Neutral
"I like the look of the earrings, although they were smaller than anticipated. The first time I wore them the blue part of earring had fallen off ~ not thinking I would find it. It was found and I reattached it ~ we shall see.",Neutral
Accidentally ordered the wrong color and they won’t help me get a new one or exchange it.,Neutral

I might have been naive thinking it will come with at least a flimsy plastic frame. So gift ability is 3 stars since you would need to get a frame to really make it a gift. Same goes for using it for yourself you need a frame or something.,Neutral
"It has a noticable smell. It is very moisturizing, but like any new skincare product, test is out first before you add it to your daily routine. I have sensitive skin, so it wasn't a perfect fit for me.",Neutral
"I love the flowers and look. However like some of the other reviews they are not sticking all that well especially on the edges. I had taken these out of the roll a couple of week prior to using them to allow them to ""relax"" and not want to curl. I did have some problem removing the flowers from the backing as the jagged edges of some of the petals didn't want to peel as one piece. Overall I love them but I might need to get wallpaper paste to ensure they stay.",Neutral
The disc are smaller than a dime but they are still cute are the chains a very firm flimsy and both of mine came broken but I put them on new tech new chains on I will keep them,Neutral

"These are good quality & exactly what I needed, but you’d think for a $17 pack of paper, it would at least come with enough “weeks” pages for one year! It only covers like half the year, so now I need a second pack to fill my planner?! It’s a rip off, in true disc-bound fashion. Think it’s time to just fully switch to digital planning..",Neutral
"It is a very small hat barely fits me , would not purchase again",Neutral
These are nice earrings but the stone is slightly smaller than the setting. There is a small gap between the stone and the edge of the setting. It seems as if the stone might be glued on the setting.<br /><br />The backs are very small and it was hard to get them on. I bent the post during the struggle. It did pass the magnetic test so it is sterling silver.<br /><br />I don't think they will hold up to daily wear and I certainly would not sleep in them.,Neutral
"Love this product and have since I received it. However, I had it personalized with my name in pink writing and it eventually rubbed off :(<br />Still use it of course, just kinda an eyesore now with illegible random pink half-letters left",Neutral
Does not fit snug. It turns while wearing and if you try to make it snug it gets misshapen,Neutral
"It says it’s made out of obsidian, tigereye, and blue tigereye stone. I’m not not convinced it is all real, real stones are cool to the touch, have weight to them, and have imperfections. The tiger eye feels cool to the touch but the obsidian does not. In the product specifications it says the gem type is marcasite. Blue tiger eye is normally a deeper blue but these are a more teal blue. The bracelet dose however feel sturdy.",Neutral
"I ordered this bag for myself, I liked the looks of it on Amazon.  It's just the right size but wish it didn't have a huge gap on top where the zipper is, rain/snow can get inside of bag even when it's completely zipped.",Neutral
Thought this would be adjustable so was disappointed when I received this.  I have big knuckles which cause a problem  Gem is pretty and larger than expected.,Neutral
We purchased these custom magnets for two rooms for a cruise we went on in September. One magnet arrived correct the other arrived with incorrect spelling (I fixed it with a Sharpie). On the cruise the size and weight of the sign caused the magnet to fail on both signs. We ended up taping to our doors. Quality not worth the price.,Neutral
Attention to detail is lacking. There was a lot of sticky residue around the vinyl sticker and a small piece in one of the corners that was not cut completely that I had to remove with tweezers. It took me 5 minutes to clean up the residue with rubbing alcohol but I should not have to finish something before giving it as a gift. I’m glad I had the time to clean it up first!,Neutral

$30+ and no frame ...It was mailed rolled up in a box ..had no clue what it was til I opened it ! Little disappointed that it didn't come in a frame because its really a beautiful picture!!,Neutral

Cheap. Won't hold a lot of medals.,Neutral
flimsy and smaller than on photo.,Neutral
Not a dandelion in sight. Had really good possibilities. Fit well...but the lack of one of the key items....the dandelion is sadly not there.<br />I would have been happy with no “silver flakes” and happy with well placed dandelions pieces.,Neutral
It’s pretty but it’s to thick and I’m not sure about the material. I wouldn’t buy it again.,Neutral
"I guess I missed seeing the word ""small"" in the description when I ordered. I wanted a bigger earring. Other than that I'm fine with it.",Neutral
"It’s a nice craftsmanship and a stylish product, but it is not comfortable to wear. It hurt my wrist and it doesn’t roll up my forearm. I should’ve bought a single stretching one.",Neutral
Good material but wasn't big enough for my full head of kinky curls -- which is disappointing given the price. Found another one on Amazon that is waaay better and half the price.,Neutral
"I love these earrings, but they are difficult to get in. Sometimes I give up and wear another pair.",Neutral
"This armband costs more than my velcro armbands but I think its worth it.  I ordered a size large. It fit snug during my first run but has stretched out.  The material is durable. I have not washed the arm band so I cant say if the material fades after being washed.  I gave this armband a 3 out of 5 because I was looking for one that I can quickly slide my phone in and out during runs. Unfortunately, I find it harder to pull my phone out and have yet to be able to put my phone back in the arm band without take the entire thing off my arm. This will do for now but I will continue searching for my perfect arm band.",Neutral
"I really like this case. It looks great and it seems to be of very good quality. It holds my  AirPods securely and it is really pretty. I like that you can select the font color, but you don't seem to have options for a font type, at least not with this listing. So you have to be satisfied with a rather feminine font (which I am. I love it!!!)<br /><br />The ONLY issue that I have with this product is that the case comes in two piece: A case and a cap (or top).<br />They are not connected and the top falls off *really* easily. Unfortunately, that's a really severe design flaw, so I had to mark it low and I won't be ordering another one. And it's really too bad, because it is *so* cute!",Neutral
It’s not what I imagined but I mean it gets the job done.,Neutral
My Adult daughter wanted this style for Christmas. I received them and was very disappointed on how  extremely small they are. I will give them to my 8 year old granddaughter instead.,Neutral

Was good for not even 1 full day before the design started to crack. Washed it and yeah its worse now 😒.,Neutral
While these labels are cute I wish I could’ve had a bit more options when deciding what labels I purchased there were a few I have no use for but I did love the ones I could use! They were easy to use and look really clean and pretty!,Neutral

"Couldn’t wait to get these out of the box. Opened the first clip to put it on my shoe and the clip broke. I was able to put it back together after a few minutes, but I’m not confident that they won’t break again. Other shoe clips I have, have a larger clip, so they are more secured. I may end up replacing the clips. The Chanel feel was worth it to keep them. The bow is a nice velvet too!",Neutral

For the price it's just a sticker. They do say this in the description which I didn't read so my bad.,Neutral

"I waited quite a while for this polish, I was super excited from the pictures. I passed by in store options to support small business. However I was disappointed sadly, I thought it would be black with specks of color, the polish itself is very light. I applied 2 coats, in picture an the other has a coat of black polish then a coat of cupcake polish. More like a deep purple, but you have to do at least 2 coats for that.",Neutral

This was what they said.,Neutral
This necklace is very pretty and comes in a really nice gift box. My only gripe is that is very small! Too small for the price I paid for it!,Neutral
"I really liked the idea of this artwork, but unfortunately picture is grainy.  The paper quality is good and may look fine from a distance, but I was disappointed in the picture quality.",Neutral
I like the print. A little pricey since you also have to purchase a frame.,Neutral
Because I live in the Worst state in the country... and I'm forced to wear a mask every other month... I got this because I want to actually breathe and I'm not afraid of a sore throat and a fever... this thing is barely better than a regular mask.,Neutral

Much smaller than expected  but nice quality,Neutral
"The product was very pretty, and as described, however, unfortunately, despite their best efforts wrapping up the frame, it was received damaged in 2  very noticeable places. I reached out to them and they said to please take a video of us unwrapping the frame? Well, my sister already open the frame.  My sister, a.k.a. the bride was so turned off by the response. She told me to forget it and she would superglue it and make it work. Somehow I’m not here to bash the vendor but it’s a little odd that you would request a photograph opening it when someone’s reaching out about Damage. Clearly already opened it. Perhaps add instructions on the order to please film or video when opening- tells me I’m not the only one receiving damages because of the delivery company.",Neutral
The print is really nice unfortunately these are shipped in an envelope. Noticible creases and bent in certain places on the actual print it self.,Neutral
Print only frame not included. Words on back paper do not pertain to M.J.,Neutral
I like the ring but because it’s adjustable and you have to bend it to put it on your finger it will eventually break. I think I will order another ring same style but not adjustable and a thicker weight.,Neutral

"This is simply a photograph of a piece of artwork printed on thin photo paper. The colors, butterflies and flowers, are nice and well done with the female silhouette; the wording gives me strength; A unique piece I have not seen before.  . A nice piece of artwork.  Framed it in an 11 x 14 Black Picture frame cream matted to 8 x 10. Only gave a three rating because the picture gets washed out.  I am going to try a double edged colored matting to see if it will emphasize this piece.  With this nice piece of art, it would be better if it were printed on linen ruffled stock paper with serrated edge and then it could be so nicely mounted for display. So three rating, I’m not thrilled but I am definitely keeping it and  absolutely would love to see it done in a different way.",Neutral
A bit smaller than I thought it would be. A great gift for granddaughter.,Neutral
I gave it away because it was to small.,Neutral
First off buyer beware of the fonts used for personalization.  I ordered 5 of these personalized Yetti's for Christmas gifts.  Four of the five were perfect but the fifth one turned out horrible because of the font that was used.  The name on the fifth one should have read McKenzey but because of the font style used it came out MaKenzey.  Very disappointing.  I notified seller of this and they did offer to re-do it. I chose to keep the tumbler as is and not return it for a re-do because it was a Christmas gift.  Before you order you might want to see what kind of font will be used.  The picture shows all five tumblers.  You can clearly see the difference in the style of font and size used.  McKenzey's tumbler is in the middle.,Neutral
They are photocopies.,Neutral
"I had a completely different experience than most reviews I have read. The Crystal itself was flawess. The peridot nice and bright, the orgonite clear. I was truly excited after receiving the necklace.... However, after a mere week of wearing the necklace... I watched the crystal fall from my neck like a spirit conssiouer watching a college kid pour the last of a well aged scotch into a jungle juice mixture. I was appalled and devastated. Now I must find another. 3 stars due to the beauty of the crystal but the poor construction makes it a waste.<br /><br />-Los Angeles Heathxn",Neutral

"I love the way this necklace LOOKS, but when i wear it the dangling bar is too light and so it doesnt stay thru the ring it is supposed to go thru, and because of this I have almost lost it multiple times.  Very pretty but it winds up simply laying around my neck or sliding straight down my shirt, if the bar had more weight, it would keep thru the ring better and keep it secure. Unfortunate as i had planned to order several)-:",Neutral

"Bought this and I love the vibrant color of the amathyst, however, the combination of the three they do not seem to be working as great. Perhaps I need to cleanse them recenter myself.

These are just printed photos. If that’s what you’re looking for then 5 stars. For some reason I was expecting these to be printed on canvas. I did end up trimming and framing them in 12” square floating frames and they look nice. Just expected a little more than what I got.,Neutral

a little too long and the saying is just repeated over and over.,Neutral
Very nice but a little expensive just to be a printed paper. It was good quality. Would be very nice on canvas.,Neutral
Is plastics easy to brake plant stem,Neutral
Not worth the price at all. Wood arrived cracked. Emblem is literally just a sticker that is already peeling off. Whatever was used to stain and treat the wood is sticky and tacky too. This is an xmas gift. I'll see what the recieptiant thinks but I'd like to send this 40 dollar piece of junk back to the xenos scum who made it.<br /><br />update: the recipient liked it. He said it makes it feel more authentic and i guess to his credit and the creator that is true. These look to be handmade at least partially and if some of the flaws are something you can live with then this would be good for you. changing to three stars b/c could be right for some.,Neutral
The rose gold color I chose came in gold. The writing was so light you had to turn lights off to read it. It’s a cute cup but definitely needs better presentation.,Neutral

"I didn’t see any other reviews having this problem, so maybe it’s because of my specific hair texture (I have very thick and wavy hair) or maybe it’s the way I’m using it, but everytime I’ve used it so far it’s left my hair feeling very waxy. I’ve been using it for a few weeks, and I thought at first the wax residue was because it was a new bar and that happens sometimes. But even after several uses my hair still feels waxy afterwards. I’ve tried using less, tried rinsing it for longer, and even tried not using conditioner afterwards in case if it was my conditioner that wasn’t mixing well with it. My hair still feels waxy and I can see literal pieces of it in my hairbrush. I’ve been experimenting with different brands of shampoo bars and haven’t been able to find one that I really like. I thought this one would be it since it seemed to use very natural ingredients, but this one has been my least favorite so far. The only thing I like about it as that the smell is great!",Neutral

"I love the concept of these and they are so attractive and soft and fuzzy on my feet. I also love that they are fitted around the feet and have rubber bottoms. The problem is the heatable insoles filled with lavender (which smell wonderful) are lumpy and uncomfortable to walk on. Great idea, but doesn’t work super well in execution. Great for heating up and ki kicking back with your feet up though! Update: I got a pair of Snookease Microwavable and reheatable insoles to put inside these slippers and they work great!",Neutral
"I got these for cartilage piercings. The attention to detail on these earrings is a double edged sword. There are actual castings of the little legs for each bees, which is great, but also not great in that they rubbed up against my piercings and I now have protruding cartilage growths from that irritation. Should I have taken them out earlier? Yes, but any future buyers beware, these are best left for lobe piercings where the tissue has less resistance to rubbing.",Neutral
The product matches the photo. It was easy to put on my watch face. My only complaint is that it is difficult to fasten.,Neutral

It’s a cute necklace but I took it out of the box and there was a big knot in it. We have been trying to get it out for the past 30 minutes and it’s still not out. Otherwise it’s a great product very stylish,Neutral
I wanted this necklace for years! I finally bought it for myself.<br /> My biggest complaint is upon arrival it took my at least an hour to unravel the chain. There is no reason I should have to spend the amount of time getting the chain apart from itself.<br />Another huge issue is two weeks later I notice when I went to put the necklace on it seemed to be tarnished a bit on the WW piece. It had been hanging up alone and there is no reason in two weeks it should be 'tarnished' so quickly. It's sterling but I have had pieces that sit for months and months that don't need cleaned. I have fake pieces even that don't change.<br />This wasn't a 10 or 20 dollar piece. If I hadn't waited so very long for this piece and had such high hopes and didn't pay over 30 dollars for it I wouldn't be so harsh on my review. But I was so excited about this for so long to get this for myself for so many reasons and for it not to be better quality upon arrival is very disappointing.,Neutral
Beautiful bracelet and well made. The problem is that the men’s size is for a small boy at best. I think the vendor made these for women instead. I wish they would be made to fit my wrist like the other bracelets I bought from this vendor.,Neutral
got 2 for my girls who are in gymnatics as a suprise. both came on time and looked fine my 9 yr old only got to use hers once and on her way to gymnasytics the bottom of her s was leaking. not sure if it was just a default but she was really upset. git should have made it more than one day. everything in her bag was soaked. i would love a replacment bc she really loved it.,Neutral
Only complaint I have is that it’s smaller than pictured. I didn’t look at dimensions though so that’s my bad.,Neutral
Really pretty bracelet. Quick delivery and very affordable. I was disappointed that the engraving was extremely light and hard to read. We gifted this bracelet to a grandmother figure and she couldn't really see the engraving but loved the sentiment.,Neutral
"I laughed when I got this ring.  Because the stones are fake for one & the other they are so small you can hardly see them.  Seriously would never buy again & further more be very Cain the future for anything like this being like he photo.  Bcuz this one falls so short you can’t see it! The wrapping around the fake stones covers part of the fake stones because of how small they are.  Terrible product, terrible.",Neutral
"I had to set it up differently bc my daughter is in xcel team and it's only for her. I'm not keeping score on the team, so to not waste pages I set it up per competing season and wrote the gyms she competed at on the side. Instead of gymnasts names.",Neutral
The product is cute but it came in the wrong color. So Im sad about that.,Neutral
I love the letters but I paid an extra $10 for &#34;silver sparkles&#34; in the silver sparkle sample it looked like I was going to get my letters covered in sparkles. I can barely see sparkles up close. Definitely won't see any once it is up on the wall :/<br />I contacted seller to let her know. I will update with her response.,Neutral
The ring pinches,Neutral
Beautiful earrings but to small for a woman ear. Great for a young girl.,Neutral
"Great scent, exactly what I wanted however it didn't last as long as had hoped.  This would not discourage me from purchasing a different product from this seller again.  Customer service is excellent and shipping was fast!",Neutral
So cute on my Blueberry Front door.  Just can't seem to get it to stay stuck.,Neutral
This item came in pretty quick. Just as described.,Neutral
I love what it says but it's just a piece of paper and I could have done it myself. To much money for a printed piece of paper.,Neutral
The tee shirt is nice but color is not anything like the picture. Picture is a bright coral color and the actual shirt is a very light peach - almost tan in color. Otherwise good.,Neutral
These are so soft you can bend them just putting them in,Neutral
"Very disappointed  , the necklace was beautiful but it didn't last on week.The pendant broke off and got lost.",Neutral
The quality is good.  Love the design.  However for Samsung Galaxy s8 the fingerprint is on the back of the phone and I can not unlock my screen or sign into my bank accounts unless I take the phone out. That is a inconvience. But I would recommend it for other phones. The bad part is they don't do returns,Neutral
"I have waist length  hair and like to wear in a bun.  Two problems with this product... too small for large buns and the stick is flat ended instead of pointed so it pulls out your hair as you pass it into the bun.  Overall, I think this is pretty but is best for small / medium sized buns",Neutral
"Creases in foil, paper quality not as good as expected",Neutral
"looks nice, just really small packages. like 5"" x 7"" x 4"" rectangular blocks<br /><br />Maybe it was meant for people with really small hands? I will need more confetti but I might have to mix this with much cheaper confetti.",Neutral
This is a really great soap for the skin. It is rich and creamy. I just wish it smelled like honeysuckle more. I live in the area that this is made. I am going to go to the store and see if it might have more scent in store.,Neutral
"Very cute! Will have updates from the kitty after his birthday next week :)<br /><br />The only misconception is that the order only comes with 1 toy. I was under the impression there were multiple in a pack. I would have chosen not to purchase for this reason, based on pricing. Oh well!",Neutral
"The workmanship was EXCELLENT.  However, no one tells you, these are created with a pattern that is not one size fits all.",Neutral
Women’s sizes run small,Neutral
"This is an extremely cute sign, however mine came damaged. In 3 different spots 😔 I honestly did still hang it on my wall though 😂 I'm lazy and don't want to deal with the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new one...despite all of that I would probably still order from the company",Neutral
Ordered on Last Monday and received at my door the following Thursday.  Not bad service for an item shipping from Europe.  Item is nice and well crafted and fits my new 12.9 iPad Pro 2018 w/ keyboard folio perfectly. Also includes pocket for Apple Pencil.  Leather side is very nice and felt side is nice and thick. Very good quality.<br /><br />Scratches way to easily. Not happy.,Neutral
"I was a little disappointed when I received this ring. No problem with sizing. It’s a prettier thing in pictures than real life. It’s a bit rough around the edges of the name area. It’s smaller than I expected. It doesn’t snag or get in the way or stuck on clothing, which is an upside. Maybe if it were sterling silver or white gold it would be better, dressier? I can’t put my finger on exactly why I’m not happy with it, it just didn’t “wow” me when I opened it, wore it or now. It’s not horrible, it’s just ehhh 🤷🏻‍♀️",Neutral
"The pattern looks just printed on and they epoxy over it. I was expecting actually pieces to make it look like a mosaic. It’s okay quality and overall is fine, but was majority disappointed at how basic it looked after opening it. Not worth the money In my opinion.",Neutral
I was honestly not impressed with these stickers. The first couple I did were great but once I got to the last one it did not want to stick. I did it the exact way I did the others. It looks cute but quality is not the greatest. I would not repurchase.,Neutral
I ordered it 1/2 inch bigger and still too small to wear comfortably.,Neutral
What I received the earrings both of the posts were almost completely broken off and bent I did bend them back and have been wearing them ever since so no issues and they are very pretty,Neutral
Rather plain,Neutral
this was a gift i didn't hear from the person of they got it or anything,Neutral
"The charms were very large & appeared much larger than the picture, in my opinion. It looked a little bit crazy.",Neutral
"I only have this 3 stars because while i love these earrings, they are so tiny that if you sleep with them in, which i accidently did, my ear ate them. Had to push them all the way through to get them out.",Neutral
"If you're buying this necklace because you're hoping for the properties of Lapis Lazuli, (or just want a piece of actual lapis in general) you're out of luck - this is most likely a dyed composite with mica flecks added in this very convenient shape that fits the stone.  (see microscope photo - flecks of blue dye = not actually blue.)<br /><br />(nerd talk:  Real lapis Lazuli has a Mohs hardness of 5-6, which means while a stone of higher hardness would be able to scratch it, but it will resist scratches from anything lower than 5 on the Mohs scale.  with a piece of calcite--Mohs hardness 3-- I easily scratched a line into it.  That would not be physically possible with actual lapis.)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this isn't pretty.  It is.  the chain and bail are simple, and suit the stone well.  It all looks very nice.  But the fact that they're lying about it being genuine and preying on people with all the talk of how it ""helps complete your beauty and chakra""  (actual quote from the packaging)  That's gross.  Just sell it as a lovely handmade necklace.  People will pay for that.  It's a cute set.<br /><br />A quick look into the company shows that they've applied in Greece for a patent for ""Jewelry and imitation jewelry.""  Make of that what you will.  I recommend buying an equally pretty inexpensive stone from someone who's not lying to you about what it is.<br /><br />PS.  Dat not hematite either.",Neutral
It is a decent product.  It doesn't really work well for me.  The place where I put my hand is too thick.  I can't get a good grip.<br />I guess I could do a little whittling around that area to thin it out so my grip it tight.,Neutral
"Two things, not as detailed as shown in picture.  Looked like the coin was  worn down considerably.  The other thing is it's slightly beveled like a cone. Other than that it's a good ring.",Neutral
Bought this for an upcoming cruise. It would only stick to the doorframe. Would not stick to the door or the walls of the cabin.,Neutral
This is a picture of a painting.,Neutral
"I thought (for some reason) that it would be larger.  I was a bit disappointed with the size, but that was probably my own fault for not noticing the dimensions.  Otherwise, it's an ok cookie cutter.",Neutral
"I bought some of these for my wife. I have been purchasing solid colognes for myself through Duke Cannon and thought these might be the femal equivalent.<br /><br />And they are, but they are very tiny. Yes, you could easily fit it in the tiniest of purses, but you could also lose it in the tiniest of purses.<br /><br />These are just big enough you could get a fingertip in them.<br /><br />The scent is okay. Nothing revolutionary.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it’s a solid ‘meh’.",Neutral
This is a good product but could use more stability to it. With the bottles on it it wants to lean. I'm sure it would be great for plastic bottles but mine are glass.,Neutral
"This is a cute necklace, however, due to a glitch in the ordering system, I didn't get the necklace that I was wanting, & got a different style of necklace instead. The necklace I did receive is cute, just not my style. It is a well designed necklace, & looks good. The plating on the necklace is a high quality as well.",Neutral
"These are much smaller than I had originally thought they would be. They are also very dirty, so be aware of that and do not plan to work with them in your house. I ordered a C and a G and there is pretty tough to tell the difference.",Neutral
Item has a lighter color strip under the star area causing a distoration on the flac. Is thisn a defect that should have been seen by qualaulty control or is it acceptable and is acceptable ?,Neutral
Very light and has very thin writing.,Neutral
SMALLER than expected!!!!,Neutral
I loved the look but very flimsy and felt like it would fall apart,Neutral
It came already stained on a section of it,Neutral
The background was more light gray than black.,Neutral
"So, I received this ring last night. I was excited as it was a beautiful ring, the cut of the gems are beautiful and the rose gold, though not super polished looking, looks more matte but I actually love that. My one BIG disappointed and the reason for the 3 stars is the color of the stone. I knew at night it would look more red/pinkish but I expected it to look more blue/green or at least blue violet in daylight... It only looks like a deep purple in full sun. The color change is pitiful and I am considering returning if possible. I'll give it some time to see if I'm able to live with the poor color change. BUT, overall, it is a pretty ring if you like purple...",Neutral
"Bottle was not full, in photos the lane is different as well. I’ll rewrite a review after a couple weeks of working with it.",Neutral
I love the pictures but they came with creases in them. Not sure how they will look in a frame.,Neutral
Way overpriced,Neutral
Nice product,Neutral
Not framed like the picture suggests. Comes in a page cover.,Neutral
"I was very disappointed to be sent a photo after searching for metal signs. As I read it carefully, it does say it's an image. This is a fine photo but not at all what I was searching for or expecting. Read the description carefully.",Neutral
"The photo quality and cost of it, is not worth it.",Neutral
"It arrived on time AND the Leopard/Cheetah print package bag was hands down, AMAZING.<br />The lettering/name is not centered, the font is good. The Straps, wish they was longer. Quality of the tote bag, is great!",Neutral
Not what I expected.  Not sure I would buy these again,Neutral
"This was advertised as an ankle bracelet/bracelt. Unless you are a very tiny human this will not fit your ankle. Unfortunately that is what I purchased this for, as I spend a lot of time on a computer and don't wear jewelry on my hands. I wouldn't order this if you expect to wear it on your ankle unless you are a very small person.",Neutral
"This ring was a little small. And it was not well finish. But to me is difficult to return it. I will keep it. Sincerely,",Neutral
"Looks exactly as described. However, I’m pretty disappointed that the T-shirt is not soft jersey qualty, but is rough and itchy.",Neutral
It doesn’t last long but smells amazing!,Neutral
"As much as I love the scent, these don't desolve as much as needed. Maybe with shower doors it would work better as we only have curtain.",Neutral
"The seller is awesome and accommodated my special request. Loved how it came out. So bummed when it started fading 2-3 months in. (Picture is of fade at 4 months.) Not sure if it's due to the hellish heat southern California has had this summer, but it was just a bummer.",Neutral
Beautiful but frail.,Neutral
The chain was a couple inches short but otherwise I loved it.,Neutral
Good,Neutral
Kind off small but will do the job.,Neutral
"The medallion itself is very nice. However. The cord is of poor quality. I’ll be purchasing a chain for it due to the poor quality of the cord. Yes, selling with a cord vice a chain makes it more affordable, but again, if it was a better quality cord it would have been nice.",Neutral
"Great idea but I sent my information over as ""Monday November 12"" but the onsie shows the day of the week as Saturday. Bummer.",Neutral
way smaller than I expected.,Neutral
Thin and brittle,Neutral
The colors aren't so vibrant and the dictionary guide words include malaise.  Not exactly a love story I was looking forward to receiving.  lol,Neutral
"It was really cute, but it came already tarnished. Two of the charms where black instead of silver. I had no issue returning it.",Neutral
It appears to be a homemade mold that loses details in the making. Too expensive for something I could have made at home.,Neutral
So cute! The letter on mine was quite a bit smaller than the image which was a bit awkward proportion wise but he still loved it!,Neutral
"I love this necklace but the chain is short and the whole thing seems overpriced. If the chain were better and a little longer, it would be 4-5 stars. Maybe I’m wrong, I don’t know a whole lot about what’s valuable or not in gems. It just seems like the chain does a disservice for the gem.",Neutral
"Knew the size, but still smaller than expected for the price.  The pricing was odd as well. The more ""family"" members you add, the more expensive it is (obviously), but the price increase per piece seems extraordinarily high for what they are. It was an anniversary gift and we debated returning it. Significant other decided to keep it out of what could only be kindness to me.  Nice piece, just not for the price and sadly wouldn't recommend to a friend.",Neutral
Nice color. Too small for adult,Neutral
"My daughter didn’t like ‘ur old enough for a nose ring’ but then warmed up to it. However, when she wore it to school and put her hand in her pocket the nose came off the ring. She was like I hated it but I’m so sad it broke. She also thought the color should be able to be chosen not just a white nose",Neutral
"[[VIDEOID:726482394375e57f308f22f81eee3140]] I love these earrings. I purchased them back in January and posted a quick video on my IG stories to encourage some of my friends to purchase, in which I received confirmation that three people did! I posted a photo on my feed today, wearing my earrings and tagged the company (received DMs asking about my beautiful jewels as I also posted an IG story boomerang), looks like I was suddenly blocked by the company, which was quite alarming! Nonetheless, I love my earrings, I hope there is no malice between myself and whomever runs their social accounts. As a PR professional, I can say that it is counterproductive to block customers if loyal business is desired. Simply removing the tag from the post will suffice, or messaging the customer for removal to preserve aesthetics. Please consider the current climate, we are working to denounce exclusion and become a society, better yet, a world of inclusion :)",Neutral
Considered sending it back.  That right leg and foot are just so messed up.  But too much work to return,Neutral
It smells really good. But it dosent smell like love spell.,Neutral
The leather is thick and inflexible. The band is difficult to put on and off and doesn't lay flat on my wrist. I'm hoping as the leather softens it will improve.,Neutral
"This was a little hard to work with in the shower as it got really soft really quickly but I really liked the way this made my skin feel soft and moisturized. Unfortunately the smell was terrible, a cross between plastic and antiseptic. If you like the smell of bergamont its a pretty good scrub bar.",Neutral
"I originally thought the calendar was fine…in June, I noticed it states Labor Day which is a September holiday. Not sure if any other issues but their proofing department should probably give a final review before going to print.<br /><br />To be fair, the company did reach out to me to offer a refund due to the error as well as replace the page with a typo. I have increased my rating as customer care speaks volumes. Mistakes happen…",Neutral
Would have given 4 stars had I not been overcharged. Overall decent but the vinyl is thin and already peeling after 2 days,Neutral
"It's okay. Not the quality of a mission frame, but you get what you pay for.",Neutral
too small and get loose easily,Neutral
"The material seems like it's a good quality and I like the way the tanning looks.  My biggest issue is the instructions, mostly the LACK of them.  I realize that it shouldn't take a rocket scientist (and doesn't) to wrap handle bars with strips of leather, but I'm sure Trip Machine Co. has learned plenty of tips & tricks that could (and should) be passed along to those of us who have not done this dozens of times or more:<br /><br />-- Which direction should I start?<br />-- Do both sides wrap in the same direction?<br />-- What, exactly is the super glue for and how should it be used?<br /><br />I shouldn't have to search YouTube to find out how to most effectively install these wraps.  I am not completely thrilled at how the wraps turned out, so I may end up getting another set and try a few things different; I am just not sure I will get them from Trip Machine Co.",Neutral
A little shorter than I would have liked.,Neutral
"Looks and feels great, until you go swimming in a pool - my black band turned brownist/grey =-/",Neutral
Would have been nicer if the inscription was on the outside instead of inside.,Neutral
"I really loved the design and ease of putting it on hat.  However, following the directions, it bled on the white hat.<br /><br />Contacted seller and very happy with quick response and resolution to problem.",Neutral
"It's ok, paper is decent quality. It showed up rolled in a tube which makes matting a bit more tricky but not impossible. The print is slightly grainy, I could have printed this better on my home printer and on the same size paper.  I expected higher quality for the money.",Neutral
"It was the right size and color,but it was not as expected. I expected a second line saying ""established 1968"".I thought it was a wooden plank with the 2 lines of name etc. carved into it.Why did they ask for what to put on the second line if there is none????? Not happy!",Neutral
Cute bite not easy to put up,Neutral

"May today there be peace within. May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.

"I seldom write reviews, but wanted to let future buyers know my experience with this bracelet. While the bracelet is cute, it doesn't fit an adult wrist. I sent it to a nice as a birthday gift. She's 36, fit & lean, but the bracelet was way to small for her wrist. She's going to re-gift it to a child.",Neutral
"Kind of disappointed. It's cute but the wood piece has more ""character"" than I would have liked. I am really struggling with the fact that my ornament (meant to be gifted) is not more symmetrical.",Neutral
"The actual chain clasp was not in proper alignment making it difficult to open and close securely.  Also my opinion, the hoop around the sea glass should be fused, it was kind of pushed together making it vulnerable to fall and get lost. I switched the chain with a resizable one from Pandora, so I feel that I paid full price for a piece of glass rather than an actual piece of Jewelry.  I gave it 3 stars because I appreciate the beauty behind the pendant.",Neutral
Pretty but not 18 bucks worth of pretty,Neutral
"The coloring of the comics are light with dull colors. They allude to the fact that this is recycled comics (I would venture to guess that it’s actually just the same comics printed on card-stock especially since the comic scenes match those shown on the model pictured. The edges of the paper are also peeling and rippling under the plastic. This is a gift for a Betty & Veronica fanatic, so I’m torn on whether to return it or not. If I had bought it for myself, I would definitely return it for a refund!",Neutral
Cute. Very short chain. I've had it about a week and the letters are barely visible anymore. Fast shipping.,Neutral
"I love the bracelet concept and especially the thought behind it as my daughter bought it for me but it is made really cheap.  It hard to get on, bends easily and breaks easily  Not worth the money",Neutral
The stones where kinda dull not shining it looks like it needs brighter stones..,Neutral
"Product is cute and dainty. I wanted an anchor next to Navy mom, like in the pictures. I saw nowhere to make a choice like that. I emailed the seller twice to ask how to ensure an anchor was engraved. Seller never replied. I decided to take a chance and order it. There was no anchor.",Neutral
The bracelet keep on breaking where the name bar was held and I had to fix it a couple of times,Neutral
"Not as expected. Bought as gift, chain does not match pendant.",Neutral
The puzzle was much smaller than I thought for the price. Also paint didnt cover the grains in the wood.I was disappointed.The colors on the letters were good.,Neutral
"These are cute, but they are too small for my ears.  The length is not right, but I think they would work for small ears, such as a teens or kids.",Neutral
Please read the very fine print. This is just a piece of paper printed and you have to purchase a frame. It's nothing like I imagined. Not happy about it but at this point my project is almost complete so I will buy a frame for it.,Neutral
Very gorgeous but it doesn't fit,Neutral
I overall like the shirt and cape. But I think the crown could've been done better. It was just glued together and some part aren't mended well. So I had to buy a crown to replace it.,Neutral
To short,Neutral
"This design is nice, but it was difficult to put on compared to other similar products I have purchased. The name letters are very thin,and wouldn't apply properly. I doubt it will be stuck to my tumbler long. It also took a long time to receive this product.",Neutral
"Super cute case with name customization, however I was a little disappointed with the flimsiness of the case. It has an attached piece to hold together the top part to the bottom part of the case, therefore every time you open the AirPods, the top piece falls off and just kind of flaps to the back and hangs there. It doesn’t stay attached to AirPod case. A little frustrating. Also, the plastic is not the best quality. You can see scratches easily. But overall, for the price its not a bad purchase.",Neutral
Lasted a only few months until it broke. Not worth the amount they’re charging. Should be cheaper.,Neutral
"The quality of the picture is good, but I feel that the girl's body is not not well proportioned. The head should be bigger or the jacket smaller. Looks a bit strange as is.",Neutral
Much smaller than the pictures seem to depict. As you see mine with the headphones next too it how the actual size is. But it is nice.,Neutral
"Was given as a gift for a retired teacher & widow. Do not know if she enjoyed this. She lived in Redlands,CA for many many years.",Neutral
"This is a very cute watch band. However, it needs a different type of fastener. There’s no way to keep it tight enough so it wants to turn on my wrist.",Neutral
You get what you pay for it looks very cheap so I cannot pair it with my clothes but I will still wear it around the house with my pajamas,Neutral
Pretty small for me.  We ended up making this a she polish bag. My leather shaving kit it was replacing for my boys is still a search.  Not what I call full size shaving kit.,Neutral
"The color isn’t what I expected.  Though I ordered brown, the color is dull and not a rich color. The product is fine and so is the quality.",Neutral
I was very excited about this order. I ordered the bronze which is definitely silver tone. This color is very hard to read. I do like it. Just not what I envisioned.,Neutral
"I absolutely love this map, I have traveled on tour for 7 years and have collected key chains along the way. This is exactly what I was looking for as far as something to display my travels. It is well put together and looks great. The double sided adhesive tape works EXTREMELY WELL! When taking it down it removed quite a bit of the wall with it. I think there should be a better method givin to hang with piece.",Neutral
"Very nice, but too small.",Neutral
Leather is great was disappointed that the hardware did not match what was pictured. Part that holds the keys is chrome instead of brass.,Neutral
"I don't like it very much. It feels well made although I don't like the leather, it just doesn't feel &#34;nice&#34; to me. While it fits my Cadet SAK and the Space Pen, the metal lug scratches the knife and will wear down the alox. Overall it also makes the two pieces much more bulky in my pocket. Not going to use it. Bummer.",Neutral
"The bar itself is gorgeous and the color is beautiful and rare, greenish blue. The chain it arrived with looked really cheep, just like pictured. But I really liked the color of the bar itself, so I already planned to put it on a different chain. The problem with it was an additional cost of $45 at the local jeweler. It turned out to be a very unreasonable expensive necklace. The picture reflects the new chain.<br />Suggestion to the seller to place on a nice shiny thin  box chain, instead of the original chain which is too thick and too dull, it will look so much better!",Neutral
Not truly black. They are a black brown.,Neutral
"I bought the 2 packaged ducks and I have mixed reviews.<br />Pros: Both came packaged very well in boxes and styrofoam for each piece. Both look like the online product images. The strings to hang them from are very durable and the porcelain/ceramic bodies look sturdy. Fast shipping and delivered with care.<br /><br />Cons: While the original sunglasses duck is well made, the backpack straw hat one seems to have been done hastly with poor materials. Specifically, the orange paint (it already chipped and the backpack itself was partially discoloured when delivered). Second, the sunglasses on that straw hat duck have already fallen off (had to superglue them back on in 1 weeks time). Third, the chain should be glued a little better because while driving it came halfway off its tiny neck. Overall 3/5 because the simple duck is just fine but the ornament filled one was not worth the money.",Neutral
I was bummed that it was a print. I thought for some reason that it was individual petals that your guest signed and then you built the flower. It was neat and well done but not what I was expecting.,Neutral

slow delivery and I needed a magnifying glass to read it; otherwise okay,Neutral
Edit-great customer service.  I am not giving up. I did the reindeer and candy cane last night with better luck.<br />They are still tricky to use.

"Smaller than I had expected despite the measurements being posted in the description, also my order for changed from dark to light finish somehow.",Neutral
It didn’t look as good as the pictures but does its job. Got it for a friend for Christmas last year. He liked it and used it to store his phone and wallet in his room. Practical use.,Neutral
"Very nice looking necklace but not a piece to be worn everyday. After wearing for several weeks, peas lose their shine and become chaulky looking. Loved the necklace but disappointed in the fade of shine.",Neutral
My daughter is a big fan of Harry Potter so I knew she would like this scrunchie.  She did like the design of the material but not so much the feel of it.  She hoped it would be softer.  She still wears it but not quite as often as I think she would if it was softer.,Neutral
"It’s a good fit, and it’s light. I barely feel it on my hand when I’m wearing it. My problem with it though is that no matter which way it is turned it snags everything. Fabric, my hair, you name it. I’ve had to yank or cut it out of pockets repeatedly. That part is a pain and makes me wear it less.",Neutral
"Very cute but clock does not work.  I ordered a larger one and now I'm disappointed as I've had to take it off the wall repeatedly to get it going again.  The reviews regarding the bent arms were correct, but I fixed that and now I think the battery looses connection and needs to be fiddled with.  Very frustrating! Perhaps a smaller one would work better.  Also, the face of the clock is a sticker so  be careful removing the packaging.",Neutral

Much smaller than it should be. Did not fit me but fit my niece. It was a good product if only it was a little bit bigger,Neutral
The pillow was difficult to get into the case.  Was afraid I would tear the case or the zipper.,Neutral
These weren’t the size I was hoping for entirely too small beautiful nonetheless,Neutral
"Everything abt this ring was exact to my order, and it arrived in a timely manner AND with an extra ring. I just don't think it's solid gold like advertised. There's no stamp on the hoop and the ends are looking a little tarnished already and it's only been a few days.",Neutral
"Installed last December and the first number fell off in February, and two more numbers fell off in early May.  They use very cheap glue.  I used gorilla glue to fix and so far they have not come off.",Neutral
Was expecting this to come as a one piece sign instead each letter is its own piece.  Disappointed in that!,Neutral
"nice, but sized for a child's wrist.<br />Sent back to seller even though I was told to keep it.  The seller made this unique bracelet, Sorry it did not fit my small wrist. I felt the seller should have it back. Seller never responded to confirm receipt. Hmmm",Neutral

Ring is nice from. The front but uncomfortable to wear. Where the ring opens kept pinching my skin. I tried adjusting but not bend as easy.,Neutral
"Beautiful, but one of mine was defective. Left earring arrived with a hairline black line through it- maybe it is a hair in the material used to make the earring?

I had to drop off a bumper sticker at the UPS store TWICE because the seller couldn’t send the right item, kind of annoyed to be honest. Just beware.",Neutral
Did not smell as advertised. The unimpressive scent fortunately dissipates after a  while.,Neutral
Reviews were right...cute but overpriced.,Neutral
"I considered returning this because it is so thick the dispenser doesn’t even work. But I do like the smell so I decided to keep it and just pull the dispenser out and squeeze the bottle to access the lotion. The scent is strong and a bit like mens cologne, but I like it enough to use it",Neutral
"The finished product was rather small. I don't believe they were even 3/8"" across. I won't buy them again.",Neutral
The ornament was very nice. The added writing was faded.,Neutral
"It was smaller than I imagined, I could have printed it off on a computer and laminated it. But to be honest, it was exactly as described",Neutral
The item is not bad I just expect it to look more like a map. It is very cartoonish. It would have been  better to just print this from your printer.,Neutral
A little bit then didn’t realize it’s plastic but it did the job,Neutral
"I honestly can't be too upset because this was a relatively cheap purchase, but the bracelet lasted about a month before it became completely discolored and unusable.<br />Bought it for my husband as a birthday gift - cool bracelet with my and my son's name on it. But within a month the silver heads became completely tarnished/discolored and now you can't even make out the names engraved on the beads. Like I said, the price is fair for what you're getting. And my husband wasn't upset, but I don't imagine I'd ever buy this for anyone else because I'd be embarrassed it turned so quickly.",Neutral
"I've been looking for a small hoop for a while. I'm pleased with the size, but it's literally just a tiny wire bent in a circle. There is no latch or connector or anything to make me think it should be worth more than $1.",Neutral
This product is what I wanted except the seller decided to personalize it their own way when I had specified what I wanted inscribed on the tote. I paid $30 and should get  my money's worth. I don't think I will be purchasing again.,Neutral
Much smaller than I thought,Neutral
"Im giving it 3 stars Because I honestly didn’t like the smell, not for these or any of the other two I bought from this brand. Im not saying they’re not good, actually I think they are great, I just dont like the smells they have at all.",Neutral
Spend a little more and get a better quality product.,Neutral
"The comfort is not good at all,  even for the money.",Neutral
Unfortunately this is going back because it didn't fit. The size is better for a child's wrist. Pay attention to the measurements before purchasing.,Neutral
"I thought it was matted and framed due to the image associated with it. It does state clearly that it is not, but I missed that, obviously. It does not fit properly in an 8x10 frame.... I will probably never get the time or the additional funds to get it properly matted and framed, so it is probaly never going to be displayed.",Neutral
The preview is not working on the order page. Did it work for other people? I would like to see how it would luck but more importantly I want to make sure they actually get my order correct since that’s the only way to put in your color preferences. I change the colors and they don’t change on the picture.,Neutral
Ok so this slime smelled so GOOD just like boba BUT it rubs of onto your skin and is pretty strong after 2 hours I could still smell it. Also the slime arrived HARD it wasn’t stretchy and was very cold out might because of the weather but idk. One more thing the slime assemble was really cute but to be honest I wouldn’t buy it again.,Neutral
It's a nice bag. I should have looked at the dimensions better. I would have liked it to be a wider bag.,Neutral
"These will work for me, although they were smaller than I thought and more gold in color than champagne.",Neutral
this is a beautiful necklace that I wore for my wedding in memory of my brother... the only complaint that I have is when I took it off the next day it left a dark green ring around my neck and I am hoping that the ring doesn't show up in my pictures,Neutral
I was not the biggest fan of this product but I know what works for some won’t work for everyone. I definitely say try it to see if it’s a good fit for your locs..,Neutral
"I gifted this as an anniversary gift. It was too expensive for the size. Also, it doesn't come framed. It's just a loose leaf sized paper in a plastic sheet. So you'll spend extra to frame it.",Neutral
"Very strong smell for the first hour but quickly fades to nothing. Lotion wise, not the most moisturizing but will do as a backup if your preferred aftershave unexpectedly runs out",Neutral
Thought it came framed. Not worth price.,Neutral
"I bought this for my mother for Mother's day, so she's had it for a little over a month now. Originally, we both loved it! It would get five stars if it wasn't turning color after about a month of owning it.",Neutral
"Its Ok I Love it , But It Keeps On Shrinking smaller and smaller I don't know why? But When I Got it Fresh in the Mail It Was Nice But Sticky, Its Good Though.",Neutral
"Item is lighter in color and in weight then I expected... (not like pictured). the wood didn't looked like reclaimed wood it looked like it was sanded ,..kinda like a light oak with hints of grey brushed on it ..not like weather wood<br />(when I flipped it over the wood that was hidden under it was weathered  ... don't understand why they didnt leave the weathered look all over the console  )<br /><br />Now for the good -- it did come earlier than I expected and the item wasn't broke",Neutral
"Cute design, but I’m doubting the inks are premium as they look more subdued (less pigmented) and a bit pixelated in real life, at least the ones I received. Plus, several of my stickers on one sheet look like black ink from another print job smeared on them... very unpolished looking. See uploaded image for detail. Item also arrived later than expected and when I’d sent an inquiry to the seller, I never did receive a response. So customer service appears to be lacking as well.",Neutral
Reminded me of getting a poster in teen magazine,Neutral
"A little expensive for no longer than it was used. Could have probably made myself, but ordered for daughter",Neutral
Smaller than expected,Neutral
"Smaller than expected and took a long time to get them, already lost both 😩 bc of how tiny they are.",Neutral
"I am the recipient, this was gifted to me by my husband. It was a super sweet gift for my first mother's day and one of several things he got me. The candle smells nice. The lip balm is moisturizing and has a nice scent. The matches are convenient, I guess, if you don't have a lighter for candles. I haven't tried the loofah soap yet but it does smell nice--it's glycerin soap so I imagine it won't be super moisturizing. The butterscotch candies are regular old butterscotch but still yummy, tea is fine. Not awesome but I'm kind of picky about tea. The biggest negative was the lotion... it came in a very cute metal tin, but the metal left rust residue in my lotion. Gross. I tried a tiny bit of it from the center where there wasn't rust--it was pretty standard lotion. Smelled nice but felt a bit filmy/residue after. I tossed the rest of the lotion due to the rust.",Neutral
"Though I liked the decal and the design, the birth year of my late son was wrong. When I ordered this online I should have taken a screen shot on my smart phone, because I’m sure I would not have entered the wrong birth and date of death. So, I ordered another decal, this time I took a screen photo before and after pressing OK on options.",Neutral
I’ve been using this wallet for almost a year now. It’s made of some kind of leather. Definitely not good quality. Whatever chemical they used to cure the leather smells really strong. Odor just won’t go away after months.,Neutral
"Cute for price.  Still had to get a different chain.  It was too small.  The gem attached I was hoping to be little darker. Overall quality is good based on price. If you want high quality go to a jeweler.  Still happy with it.  Once 3 years pass, not sure what I’m going to do with it anyway .",Neutral
It’s pretty and I love the way the text looks. The wood is also a really pretty color and grain. I did notice some issues on the edges. Some nicks and wood that needs to be sanded down. I was also a little bummed that it didn’t come with the hardware to hang it up. But I know we can fix those things ourselves here. Little disappointed but pretty overall.,Neutral
"The product is shown in a mauve color. However the default color is white. If you want any color besides white, it costs more and you have to choose it at checkout otherwise you will get white. My daughter mistakenly did this and when I went to return it, it was going to cost me $13 to return! The shirt itself is good quality and soft. I ordered the right color but wasn't willing to pay to return this one.",Neutral
Now that I got it...no frame-black paper with print!  Don't waste ur money,Neutral
The only thing I didn’t like about this product is my name is engraved crooked. It’s much farther to the right of the case. Otherwise good case for your AirPods,Neutral
"Tarnish very easily, within a week it turned from gold to silver even though is water never exposed to water.",Neutral
"I expected/wanted it to have a weathered appearance, but there is actually an area that has been touched up with a much brighter white like someone tried to patch or cover something.",Neutral
"Nice ornament, but the lettering is smaller than it seems on the web page. Delivered in the time frame stated. Save your money on the gift box. Very disappointing. A plain white box for more than 3 bucks.",Neutral
I liked the old world Santa.  Looks like the artist takes pride in her work.  But .....  wish I knew when I ordered it was one. The picture shows a group.  So for the price for one  it’s a no for me,Neutral
Cute but tarnished quickly,Neutral
I would have like to known the dimensions of this piece,Neutral
"Doesn't look as nice as the picture does.  I thought the tie backs would be the same color as the flower.  They are a very bright white, and I have a difficult time hiding them behind my gray curtains.",Neutral
"Product is cute! It was bent when I received it , but hung it up outside In front of my salon anyway. I love the idea, but a bit thinner than I thought. The price was reasonable so it will work for what I needed it for.",Neutral
"It is cute, original chain is dainty - more suitable for a child. Packaging is great. The idea and sentiment are cool, but the dandelion is hardly visible, you’d have to peer at it very closely in bright light to see it.",Neutral
The gem is very beautiful. I recommend using a real silver chain though.,Neutral
Somewhat tinny. What would you expect from a shell casing.,Neutral
"Pendant is very nice, but the chain is not the length advertised; it is 10-12&#34; (did not measure it), not 18&#34; as it states in the description.  Also, I would have paid a bit more for better packaging.  I did not look at all the photos or read the full description to see it was just attached to a piece of cardboard.  I am giving it as a bday gift to a friend and I lowered the star rating because the description is not accurate; the packaging issue is my fault for not viewing all the photos and only glancing at the description.",Neutral
"These get a 5 for appearance and craftsmanship, but they are too heavy to wear comfortably.  They stretch my ear lobe and hurt after wearing them for a short while.  They are also very long, which isn't usually an issue, unless they are heavy and hurt.  Everytime I turned my head the earrings would bump my shoulder and it would hurt worse.  If you don't mind heavy earrings then these are very pretty and well made.  Since I wore them once I didn't return them.",Neutral
"I like the concept of the bracelet, but it is impossible to tighten on my wrist when I am alone.",Neutral
I was a little displeased with the centering of the name tag...I sent a private message to the manufacture and received a very unprofessional reply! Person I bought this for was happy ....at the end of the day that's what's important.,Neutral
"I originally got a unisex large of the darker gray, was nice comfy material but a bit tight on my mom belly but fit as a normal women's lg. I returned and got an XL White to wear till i lose a bit of weight and this was rough gildens fitting like an XL men's, completely different. Print was great quality varies way too much though.",Neutral
Fades quickly.  Cheap adhesive,Neutral
Product measurements are misstated and not correct.,Neutral
"I was very disappointed in it. Stitching was off the clasps, snaps and it was smashed almost almost flat. I would never buy from this distributor again. However I did keep it to remind myself never to order from a third party!!!",Neutral
"I received my item today. My wife and I really like the font and size we picked, but I am disappointed because there is an inch long scratch on the front side of one of the letters. Other than the scratch, the product is of good quality.",Neutral
Over priced for what they were...,Neutral
"Don't use black and white photos. They don't turn out so well. We used pictures of our Labrador dogs in a black and white photo. One Lab is a chocolate, so she turned out really dark compared to our picture that we sent them. I would have given this more stars if the pictures had been better quality on the stones. The stone coaster themselves are a unique piece, just wish the pictures put on them were better.",Neutral
"I got this for my Ma's 65th birthday cake I make. It was a thin paper and so I was so scared it would ripe before I could use it, but it worked out fine. Just be very careful when handling it.",Neutral
I ordered gray shirts for our family of 10. The color on the print is muted and not as vibrant as in the pictures advertised. Disappointed in the way they came out.,Neutral
I paid $145.00 for everything. It's all cardboard except for heart covering which is plastic. You have to put the cardboard box together which doesn't fit well and the hearts are too small to write much of anything. Very disappointed ☹️,Neutral
It smells really good. But it dosent smell like love spell.,Neutral
"These are very nice quality but would say color is more accurately a frosted rose color.  Kept them as I will wear them with other items than they were purchased for and, again, the quality is nice.",Neutral
"I bought two shirts, one for my baby and one for my nephew! Both were true to size but as soon as you wash once, it does shrink! So if you plan on wearing more than once, I’d definitely recommend buying a size up!:) Also, after I had washed my sons shirt for the 1st time, the design did start to crack and chip. So if you are trying to wear multiple times, maybe try to air-dry the shirt, instead of using a dryer machine!:)",Neutral
Thought It would be bigger,Neutral
Where the plaid is peeled up,Neutral
"The print quality is not good, and it is creased from shipping. Won't buy from this supplier again and I don't recommend to others.",Neutral
"I really like it... except the pins are just entirely too long. It would pin well on a thick hoodie or something but on my thin vest at work, not so much... Because it is so loose, it mostly hangs downwards and makes it harder to read/notice. I'm really disappointed that it doesn't work for me but it's still a good product.",Neutral
The paper was much smaller than I expected. It's very delicate. I would suggest opening with a helper to help prevent tangles.,Neutral
"Great gift! I bought one for myself & my granddaughter. I wore mine for a couple weeks without taking off & noticed it had bent. It held up to the water, but I’m worried by sleeping with it that it will bend & break.",Neutral
I love these earrings! Wish I could remember the name of the site. No worries; I still have the mailing envelope they came in so I can order some others. Very nice 👍,Neutral
Came out beautiful and super fast shipping! Kind of pricey for just a piece of paper... One corner was bent ): but thankfully the frame I bought covered it.,Neutral
"3 stars because it does look similar to the picture and the gift packaging is cute, but for over $20 this is not worth it. It’s small and fits in the palm of my hand and there is nothing exactly stunning about it. I thought it would be bigger for the cost",Neutral
"The picture used for the advertisement shows this shiny golden shine, in real life however it's a drab gold, with very little sheen.",Neutral
"At first I felt underwhelmed and even a little skeptical but once I put it on, it's super cute! Also very comfortable but kind of difficult to put on as you may worry you are going to break it or bend it the wrong way",Neutral
I liked it but is was way to small and left my wrist throbbing,Neutral
I was hoping for bigger letters but it's cute,Neutral
"Very nice , cleansed with sage to take off bad vive that was attached to it , but pretty",Neutral
These earrings are cute. I like the color but I don't expect them to last long. They seem pretty cheaply made.,Neutral
The wood color is nice and it came relatively quick. However it doesn’t come with the hooks to attach to the wall or an option to purchase that way which kind of stinks for the money you Pay. Also it arrived damaged. It is not bubble wrapped for transport and a corner piece got damaged ans is missing some wood and some color was missing because of it. Sucks cuz you spend $100 and want it to be as good as it can be. Didn’t return cuz I needed it as baby will be here soon. the script is nice and it was what we were looking for.,Neutral
"The necklace came in great condition. The only complaint that I have is that I ordered the chain in gold, but it arrived in silver. Still a nice chain but it isn’t what I ordered",Neutral
Not the same color,Neutral
A bit smaller than I had expected. Wish it was bigger and the names were bigger.,Neutral
Product shipped fast and with the expected design as shown in photos.  There was some ink/dirt on the white shirt that I couldn’t get out but otherwise decent product.,Neutral
"It’s too hard to put on. It also does not lay flush on my skin, so the features don’t work. It is very pretty though.",Neutral
"Very thin, lightweight plastic.  I expected a thicker, flexible tag.",Neutral
"I bought this book because I enjoyed her Energy Mandalas but I am very disappointed. The presentation of the book is lovely but not really my concern with coloring.  Most of it is very simple images. Just saying there are a variety of skill levels is not specific enough. I would wish that they put that into a percentage, such as 70% for beginners, balance being more advanced. I may find 3-5 pages that I will enjoy coloring.",Neutral
Disappointed,Neutral
"Slightly disappointed. Pyramid has far less crystals than are shown in the picture. The clear middle crystal is leaning and off center, seems poorly constructed, like it was thrown together carelessly. For the price I would have expected something consTructed with more care and better attention to detail. Bought as gift for friend, she likes it which is the only reason I’m giving 3 stars instead of 2.",Neutral
"I will say first, my child loves this night light. As the person that bought it, I'm not in love with it. Seems like there were some quality issues when etching the plastic. The plate has several cloudy spots that cause the light not to pass through properly. I am not sure if this is the plate itself or the etching. There is also an issue with the base. The base works as it should as well as the remote that is included but the plate itself does not fit in it. Either the plastic needs to be thicker or the base that it sits into need to be narrower. The plate is very wobbly and it is having a hard time staying upright.",Neutral
"I like the look & I like the leather, but it was hard to tighten & tie the leather laces. As a result the leather slips on the handlebar grips.",Neutral
Really small in size,Neutral
"Looks nice. But didn't feel the price was right, also looks very fragile. I returned mine. The seller was nice enough to let me return it.",Neutral
"Feedback:<br /><br />The product is 3-D printed. It did not seat on the B&T magazines. This might be due to the item not being sanded smooth or an error in the printing of the magazine loader. The ammunition did not slide easily along the grove and for me stuck in the track. Again this could be due to it being roughly 3-D printed and not polished smooth.<br /><br />Customer service was good and he tried to resolve my issues. I did have to pay the shipping to return the product, but I guess that is to be expected.<br /><br />With a little refinement and quality control, this product and seller have potential, but I would not recommend it at the moment.",Neutral
I wish the back was a little more sturdier. Otherwise ok.,Neutral
For $13 I expected at least a clear photo that I ordered.<br />I am not a photographer but this product seems to be a picture of a picture.<br />It is very disappointing that this item is blurred and not worth framing.,Neutral
Super cute but the page it’s printed on is slightly yellow compared to other llama pages I bought from the same seller.,Neutral
Cute but uncomfortable,Neutral
"Nice idea to send to a loved one, would have liked either a stand on the back to put on a desk or shelf or a little place to hang it on the wall.",Neutral
Pretty but much smaller than pictures depicted.,Neutral
"I bought these twice now and both times the flower has come off the post.<br /><br />But I love them so much. I finally found that titanium doesn't irritate my ears, and I can leave these in 24/7 with no irritation. If the seller has any tips for making the flower stay attached, that'd be great!",Neutral
I thought it was bigger.<br />I would like to have one that is big. Maybe this is a  baby,Neutral
Se me rompió pronto 😔,Neutral
Cute product! There were just a couple chipped spots on two pieces that I had to file down so that my toddler wouldn’t get a splinter,Neutral
"Didn't like the rough edges. Cuts my daughter's arm, edges should be smooth!",Neutral
"My sister liked this as her Christmas present, except nobody could tell what it was until I told them. She used it for a little while, but it broke when she accidentally knocked it off the counter one time.",Neutral
It's smells good. That's all I can say.,Neutral
"Average gift, usable, but not special, high quality I was looking for. I gave VERY specific directions on the engraving and the directions were not followed and no follow up communication to let me know it would not be the same as I requested. The gift is usable, but I am disappointed in the engraving, the customer service, and the end product. I did my research, gave detailed instructions and the final product was a letdown.",Neutral
Not as solid made as I had thought.  Pretty much it was just construction paper on a toothpick but it was still pretty.,Neutral
We love it lil smaller then planned but it’s cute where we put it,Neutral
I love the way it looks but the chain itself is a bit cheap and flimsy. I would probably order the bar itself and get a better chain because it broke a week after I had it on.,Neutral
"I love wearing my gold filled necklaces. I have others from Amazon, different brand,  that do not fade to dark, this one sadly is darkening. However, if you’re wearing it on its own, probably better, I ordered it representing each one of my 5 kids, so there are five letters and it holds up great! Sits perfect and comfortably on my neck and does layer with other pieces.",Neutral
Some arrived without the bead to allow for adjusting size behind the ears.  Disappointed....,Neutral
Ring is good and heavy but stone need to b more visible n show up. And ring must b wider frm other way .... Too broad on side ways .,Neutral
Use body powder to compliment my patchouli oil,Neutral

Smaller than expected,Neutral
These prints do not include the picture fram as pictured. Very disappointed,Neutral
Wish I wouldn't fade so quick,Neutral
Its really cute but a lot smaller than I expected for the money I invested but will use it as I am a collecter of snowmen.,Neutral
"The name on the product was what I decided to buy, but the utensils to hold the “case” in the bags broke in the same week. The price is expensive for the quality.",Neutral
This necklace is pretty but the stones are not cold to the touch like a real crystal so I'm not sure this is real. I'll keep it but probably put in cabinet with my crystals I will not be wearing it,Neutral
Painted from one side only! :(,Neutral
Its small. Should have gotten a larger size. I am not please with the size of it.,Neutral
Not much smell,Neutral
"Super comfortable and easy to put in given that sterling silver is a much softer metal than titanium. Love the non-specific geometric pattern of it. Really classy and different at the same time.<br /><br />Edit: I'm afraid I must amend my review. I noticed the jewelry moved a bit and I saw it looked very black where it had been in my ear. I decided to try to take it out and see what was wrong, and it snapped in my ear just bending it slightly to angle it out of my ear. There was no injury, but picture 3 is the result of being in my ear for over a year. I am very sad because I love the look of this piercing. I must note that silver does tarnish and this naturally happens over time, I just didn't expect it to snap in my ear when taking it out. I must also note that because my piercing was fully healed, the tarnish did not discolor or infect my ear. If your piercing is still new, I would refrain from purchasing this piercing because healing skin can discolor in the presence of oxidation.",Neutral
Shrank after 1 washing!,Neutral
"Lovely product,smoothes under eye,unfortunately does not take away the dark circles",Neutral
"the bracelet itself is nice, however the clasp is too difficult to maneuver. and does not lay flat.  Didn't care too much for it.",Neutral

It's giving what it fi giving,Neutral
"material that the bracelet was made of wasnt very sturdy. for the price that i paid for it, i would have hoped for a little better of materials",Neutral
Ok,Neutral
"Although it a cute ring, once you have it the inscription is difficult to read.  Upon returning, seller was a bit reluctant but did the return anyway.  I wanted this ring, just needs some work.",Neutral
"I like small jewelry since I have small features. I really like the meaning behind the turquoise, so it was an easy choice for me to select this one. It's definitely accurate to describe this as dainty. I could literally curl up the entire necklace onto a penny I had sitting on my desk. The ""stones"" are very small, but they look ok when wearing this as a choker.<br /><br />I had planned on wearing this all the time with my cross, but the care directions make it clear that you should not do much of anything with it on. No sleeping, showering, or even moving around too much. I'm not sure what kind of clasp this is since I've never seen it before, but the ball slider slips even when on. I tried to show in the photo that there is nothing to prevent it from sliding over the bar and off your neck. So I'm almost afraid to wear it for fear that I may lose it.<br /><br />It's pretty, but it seems pretty fragile. And it's a necklace that you will be regularly taking off and putting back on, which is a bit difficult due to the size of the clasp.",Neutral
I didn't like the turning colors that rusted my finger,Neutral
As expected,Neutral
Medallion is very small -- only the size of a nickel. Picture was misleading.,Neutral
"The pendant itself was beautiful, but the chain looks very cheap. After buying a new chain, my mother loves it and it looks really pretty!",Neutral

"My daughter-in-law, to whom this was gifted, loves it very much. That's good enough for me. When she sent me the picture of it, though, I was disappointed that it didn't look at all like the one I saw online. I wanted the more orange one for a reason, and that's why I chose it. This one is more blue. I'm not even sure it is a fire opal. Even the setting is not the same as the ad pic. Also a disappointment to me. If I'd bought it for myself, I would send it back. That's why I give it only 3 stars.",Neutral

"Purchased for my granddaughter, the necklace look good for the price. How the letter charm keep falling of the necklace.",Neutral
The earrings themselves are super cool however are far too thick of an earring to comfortably  wear for me personally. Definitely not a bad price for the quality of the product. I would still recommend for a child as I am a 37 year old woman lol.  I so badly wanted them to be a better “fit” for me personally.,Neutral
"The earrings and necklace are absolutely beautiful but the earrings are just a little bit too heavy. Craftsmanship is excellent and if the sea glass teardrops were cut in half, the earrings would be more lightweight.",Neutral
The case would not close. The zipper didn’t work properly. The sellers kindly refunded my money.,Neutral
"Although I appreciate the handmade quality of these stickers, $7 for one page of stickers is a little steep for me. I won't be purchasing again.",Neutral
"I bought this for a maternity photoshoot, but was hoping they could be a daily wear. They were so pretty when I unboxed them, and I didn’t wear them before the day of my photoshoot! Less than 3 days later (I never took them out after the maternity shoot) they were black and they turned my ears black as well. I wasn’t expected them to last a year or anything but turning black within a well? Terrible. Which sucks before they were sooooo pretty fresh out the package:(",Neutral
I love the charm with my sons initial and birth date on it but I had to have it soldered around the clasp that holds the charm to the necklace. It wasn’t closed properly and I was afraid I’d loose the charm.,Neutral

"I'm a bit disappointed in the color of the blood stone. I know colors vary on natural stones, but my is so muted and much more pinkish toned than the green/red of the photo given. And the turquois stands out much more than I wanted. The earrings look bleached out, and I was so looking forward to something that looked like what I ordered.",Neutral
"The necklace is pretty. The sand dollar is real but, it is not silver dipped as stated. It’s more like silver paint. Disappointed because I believed that it was silver dipped it would be stronger but, it is very fragile.",Neutral
These look super nice but immediately after putting them in the glass spice jars some of the corners began lifting. They don’t seem super sticky or sticky enough to last a long time. For the price I just expected they would adhere better.,Neutral

Not classy enough to be gifted,Neutral
It was an ok necklace. The reason why I returned it was because the stone was chipped on a side.,Neutral

"I was very excited when I found these online. I wanted to use them with chalk. I used the regular jumbo chalk that I normally get online and at the stores that my kids use on the sidewalks. So disappointed. The I don’t know if the wooden stencil, which is very nice, is only meant to be used with paint but using chalk did not work. So unfortunately I was not able to include bunny footprints for Easter morning. My plan was to use these for the driveway and sidewalk with chalk.",Neutral
"This ring is really cute and I enjoy wearing it every day.  My issue with it is twice now in the few months I have owned it, the stone has fallen out.  The first time I happened to see it lying on the floor.  I glued it back in with Tombow Multi Liquid Glue which is a really sturdy glue.  The other day I was washing my hands, and when I took the ring off, the stone again fell out into the sink.  It was lucky for me the stone didn't wash down the drain.",Neutral

"This is a beautiful bracelet and the price is right. The only problem is that Shannon attaches the crystals facing the wrong way, with the rounded part facing the disc, so the crystal doesn't lie flat and the facets are facing inside.<br /><br />But if you let her know when you order that you want the rounded part of the crystal facing outward and away from the disc, you'll have a five-star bracelet for sure.<br /><br />I'm having my jeweler flip those stones, and then I'll have a five-star bracelet too!<br /><br />As far as another reviewer's complaint that the etching was too small, that is not correct at all. It's beautiful and big, exactly like the picture. Also, some reviewers complained about the bracelet being too small, but you can get a larger one for just $3 more. And that one is perfect.",Neutral

"We purchased this as a wedding gift for our friends and we were pretty pleased with the timely manner in which we received it! My negatives I would write about this would be that it’s much much thinner than the one we received as a gift some years ago. You could also see a lot of slag bumps from the plasma cutter that weren’t exactly touched up and just painted over. Overall decently happy, if it wasn’t the fact of a time crunch I probably would have returned it.",Neutral

Nice but reverse side of lettering we can see the etching marks.,Neutral

Love but one of the tips is cracked off. Didn’t realize until I took it out of the package. I need the others how can I get a replacement for just one piece,Neutral
The letters kept coming off with the top sticker. I had to get it started and hold it down while I peeled it off. But I'm very happy with the end result.,Neutral

It is a nice print. I wish for the money the paper was more thicker than the normal standard photo paper. Will have to wait and see after purchasing a frame.,Neutral
Too small and very thin easily breakable but looks pretty.,Neutral
Seemed skimpy and smaller Thant I thought. It did not come with the watch charger.  I ordered two and only received one. Three weeks now still haven’t received the second one.,Neutral
"I first off want to say that when the product first arrived it seemed to be of good quality vinyl. The design was clear and not blurry and it does look just like the picture. Unfortunately, the decal does not cover the whole magic band. Instead of covering the whole side of the magic band without the holes, it has a curved end which exposes the color of your magic band. They do show this in the pictures, but I didn't realize because they show it on a purple magic band. If you have any other color magic band besides purple it makes it look ridiculous. The sticker also seemed to apply well at first, but soon got a ton of crease lines and didn't look good. I tried to use a blowdryer as per their instructions to re-activate the glue and press all the edges down. Unfortunately it still looked the same after an hour. I purchased a very similar vinyl to this on a different website and it applied perfectly and covered the entire magic band and didn't leave any part of the band exposed. I would suggest maybe skipping this one and looking elsewhere if you have anything over than a purple colored magic band.",Neutral
Love the shirt but stitching started coming apart from the first wear.,Neutral
So I opened the package tried to put it on it just fell down the drain. It is extremely thin and small cute but not worth the price even if I didn’t lose it. I never tried it on but it looks just like the picture just very small,Neutral

"I personally didn't feel any motivation or a boost in confidence, but it's cute at least.  For the price it's at ($25), it's not worth it.",Neutral
Really like the smell of this product. Unfortunately the lid wasnt fully sealed and about 1/2 of the mist leaked into the bag it was packaged in. Ill use the rest of it as it smells really good.,Neutral
Bent and paint coming off. One was smaller then the other and order the same size.,Neutral
I love this hat but the sizing was extra large. Way too big and therefore has trouble staying on.,Neutral
They melt out real quickly in the shower but does give some relief.,Neutral
"As I write this review the current price is $15. When I bought mine 1-2 months ago it was less than $5. I have no idea why they’ve tripled the price in two months, but it’s not worth it! This little ring is comfortable and looks okay, but it’s literally just a single tiny ring of fake metal. Are you really about to pay $15 for that? So annoyed with companies skyrocketing prices for the sake of profit.",Neutral
More yellow gold than shown in picture and also much smaller,Neutral
Ok,Neutral
"They look good at first. Unfortunately there is no instruction how to remove the back small pearl. So both me and my wife tried to remove it at the same time.

"This produce provides a very nice shine prior to finishing. The only problem I have is that it is dark green in the can.  It has left some dark stains on light woods in end grain that I could not even sand out. That was on some problem maple, so hopefully it won't be a problem normally. Very price competitive with other sanding pastes.<br /><br />Update- I've been using another brand with good effect. However, I made some small bowls from redbud tree wood and decided to try the True Grit on these since they are darker wood. It did a great job leaving a smooth surface and pleasing pop of the grain. It is quite thick and harder to apply than the other product, but came off well with buffing. I finished one with poly, and the other with Danish oil. Both look great!",Neutral
"These are cute, but quite a bit bigger than expected. I’d rate higher, but the shape was unflattering and not really a horseshoe.",Neutral
"the lettering is not a bold black as shown in the photos ,,, therefore rather hard to read,,, exspecially on a shiny surface ,,, its a gift so hope the receipiant can read it",Neutral
It was sharp edged and unpolished like the photos. Not sure it was worth the 18$ I paid for it. I expected better quality for the price I paid for the charm.,Neutral
Love the product. The butterflies a bit small for my liking.,Neutral
Not as glittery as I expected.  I will be using it on my great neice’s First Communion cake.,Neutral
"On the left is what I got (it was a gift from a sweet friend).  On the right is what you show here.  If mine had had a lighter and bluer background, and looked like your online example,  I would have loved it.  The picture composition is nice.  The print quality is not.  It was like a rorschach test.  I saw angel wings on a headless person, paddling a canoe.  In your online print, I see a fabulous astronaut.  I did like the moon, however, and the concept.",Neutral
I thought they smelled really good. The price was just too high though.,Neutral
"very cute bag- perfect for that smart-alec friend who has everything girly-girl. Anyway, I liked the bag but hate to say it's not entirely worth the price. I gifted this to a very good friend and within a week- the tassel came off the zipper. The zipper also started getting stuck. Then a week or two later I saw a similar bag on sale at a local drug store I frequent. It's a cute idea but for the price, definitely wasn't worth it this time sorry. I really liked it too, too bad it didn't last very long.",Neutral
"The band, or shank, is made from bronze and silver but feels like a welded strip of recycled tin or aluminum which means it must be something like 96% bronze and only 4% silver. Also, it slides on rough - making it feel like it will scratch the skin. Once on, the overall design is beautiful enough to almost make you forget the band. Is it worth $36? Not at all. But I'm not sure yet if I'll return it. I have to try it on again and see if it brings me enough joy to outweigh the disappointment.",Neutral
Too small for any impact.  Just average.,Neutral
Needs three attachment screw holes and doesn't come wit screws.,Neutral

The jewelry is beautiful but don’t think it’s actually 16g way to big to fit in my tragus piercing.,Neutral
"The paper side and the sticky side tear in-between a lot when you try to peel them off and it makes the sticker unusable (or if you're lucky, it's not sticky in only some parts), no matter how gently you try to peel them off.

"Not as pictured.  Should have paid more attention to the description / write up.<br />Totally my fault.  I reviewed pictures of the tube clock in various office type settings that made it appear larger than it is.<br />At the price of $229.  it is over $50. per inch.  Again, my fault so there it sits on a book case shelf.<br />I hope it last for many years as a reminder to pay more attention to detail when ordering items.",Neutral
Pretty but small for a younger person. Colors nice. I have some red ones from same vendor. I love them.,Neutral
"These four leaf clover earrings disappointed. They were cheap and plastic, and not as large as shown in he photos. As a red head who looks quite Irish already, I was looking for something more ironic, and these don’t work for that. On the plus side, they are lightweight and won’t pull down your earlobes. I will wear them but continue to look for something else.",Neutral
"I was so excited to get in this necklace! I do adore it, but the charm and the connector for the charm<br />Have faded to silver/steal color and the stone doesn’t have the transparency I would have expected for a genuine black tourmaline. I think it’s extremely important for businesses to be very clear I there is any other metal other than gold and what the base metal is. I am extremely allergic to anything that’s not pure gold, platinum, or high quality silver. My skin blisters and breaks out in hives. I can’t have any plastic against my skin or coated nickel or alternative metals.<br /><br />I’m grateful for the piece of jewelry but may fix it up<br />Quickly and regift to someone who doesn’t have sensitive skin.",Neutral
Arrived quickly.  Small in diameter,Neutral
"Nice but not as nice as I expected.  They did look good from a distance (across the room) but up close examination proved to be a little disappointing.  Being a bit artistic, I sanded them down a little and repainted them and they look fine.",Neutral
Thought these would be great for sensitive ears and they looked great upon arrival; but then my daughter wore these in the shower and they lost quite a bit of the paint. :(,Neutral
"Quite decent masks.  I've gotten compliments on the fabric patterns.  They provide reasonable, but not quite generous, coverage.",Neutral
"Banner arrived in plenty of time. Colors and photo great, but it was rolled  flat and appeared as though it had been folded in half at some point. Outer box appeared as though it had been folded too, which indicates it happened during shipping and obviously damaged the banner.

Can’t see the animal when it’s on because it’s too small.,Neutral
This is the price for one soap and not two as seen in the picture.<br />If you collect scented soap you may want to bypass this one.,Neutral

Writing is so small you can barely see it to read.,Neutral
"This is a nice necklace, but it's heavy. I've worn it a few times but due to it's size and weight I usually opt for other jewerly. It's a beautiful piece though.",Neutral
These are great in theory. Haven't had them long and the &#34;paint&#34; on the bullet head is already rubbing off.,Neutral
"These look very nice, but they are small.  With my shoulder length hair they were hard to see.  I returned based on their size.  Nice earrings if you're looking for a smaller one.",Neutral
"Very flimsy, but at least the gold flecks didn't drop off on the cake.",Neutral
"The overall item is ""cute"" but for the price, much smaller than I anticipated.  Be careful to look at the measurements to see if it's what you're truly looking for, before purchasing.  The photo on the site makes it appear as thought it's as wide or wider than a fireplace, when it's actually about one third that size.",Neutral
Not what I thought it was but works as I need it.,Neutral
This looks to be well made but the colors are pretty washed out compared to the images in the listing. I am keeping because it was too late to buy another gift and was quite disappointed,Neutral
I really love the bracelet but the clasp keeps loosening every time I tighten it.  It isn’t a traditional hook clasp the keep each side together,Neutral
I think the stone was black instead of blue but over all a pretty nice ring,Neutral
Bends very easily,Neutral
Ring is good and heavy but stone need to b more visible n show up. And ring must b wider frm other way .... Too broad on side ways .,Neutral
The stone is a lot smaller than in the picture. And mine was dark blue. Still kind of cute though.,Neutral

I expected them to be dipped in something to protect the stickers from coming off… I also got two stiff straws and one just floppy one that you can tell doesn’t go to these cups.. I should have just looked on Etsy for some different more durable ones.,Neutral
"I’ve wanted this band for a while, but I usually don’t spend more than $20 on a band. I finally broke down and ordered it. I love everything about the band except the clasp, which is a rather important part. It is like cheap jewelry that you get from a bubblegum machine.",Neutral
We really like the large letter but it was a Christmas gift I bought for my son and right out of the packaging he found areas of rust on the back.  I can’t find a way to communicate directly with the seller to see if there is someway to eliminate this problem.  Hopefully he will see this and get back to me.  I find the Amazon chatting system to be extremely limiting.,Neutral
The white area is faded and darker than it looks in the picture. Everything else works fine,Neutral
Gold plated I left the ring in my nose for four days  boy my nose was pussing up very cute tho,Neutral
I like the size and style of this bag but was disappointed by the color. I ordered it in navy blue and it reads as a strong black.,Neutral
These clouds are great for the nursery. Down fall is there is no way to install them without purchasing transfer tape from your local craft store. So whatever they cost add extra cost for the transfer tape you have to purchase separately.,Neutral
"This is a pretty bracelet, with beads that seem to change color tone in the light.  Not all the beads are the color changing ones, and two of three of these were broken the first day.  Of course, they were worn by kids, but I had to remake them.",Neutral
"Cute, but not as big as expected. Will still work to track water intake, but had problems removing stickers. Didn't seem like they were cut all the way through, so some peeled a bit. Color rubbed off a little bit on some, like the ink didn't set completely. I am going to use these, for now, but I won't reorder and I will find something else that is better quality/value. Really wanted these to be great...",Neutral
I purchased this for my 11 yr old daughter. She was quite pleased with it. I also thought it was really pretty and seemed like quality. However the first time she wore it the charm fell off. I was able to get it back on without too much trouble but later the same day the initial charm fell off and was lost. So she and I are both disappointed with that. But even with just the aquamarine gem it’s pretty. Just thought the initial would be cute and make it personal for her. I don’t think I would order from here again. For the amount spent I would rather try somewhere else.,Neutral
The online picture had me fooled! The print quality is good but it's just too small for hanging on the wall maybe I'll find some way to use it.,Neutral
The wall hanging arrived with the blue flower detached.,Neutral
Too expensive for one stick!,Neutral

"Product was nice but, it is clearly made to be used indoors.

I ordered two stockings they came out good but my name was spelt wrong.  I just contacted the seller and I am awaiting for a new stocking with the correct spelling of my name.  It is not as thick as I would have expected though.  The product is expensive and I expected it to be thicker.,Neutral
"The size is way off, you would have to have a very wide wrist to wear each of these. Additionally the Hers bracelet was very thin so two of the His bracelets would have been a better order.",Neutral

Got for my daughter and she loved it she cook in it every day,Neutral
The chain and pendant are on the small side.,Neutral

"The images are printed on glossy paper, which takes away from any vintage-like quality.",Neutral
"Thank God I have a jewelry repair kit, this is a pretty ring and I love it, but the setting prongs grab on just about everything. Luckily I noticed the prongs were opening before losing the stone.

They’re super cute. But they’re definitely not real Swarovski. The price is a little steep for what it is. Good for a adding a pop of color to your outfit though.,Neutral

For some reason I thought it was metal. My bad... I could have made this with my cricket a lot cheaper.,Neutral
expected a better quality,Neutral
Poorly put together. Some pieces have already come off. Didn’t realize the rings were plastic.,Neutral
Very disappointed I could of done a better job. Black paint does cover whole board it’s spotty very dull finish. Letters are badly sponge painted on. Looks nothing like the picture on amazon. They have been very nice about the problem and are working with me on it.,Neutral

"My sweet son bought me these earring for Christmas because ""mom loves the color purple"". He was so excited to see me open them on Christmas morning that I had to go put some rubbing alcohol on them and put them in my ears right away. According to my husband (he helped our son order them), the stones looked a lot smaller in the pictures. These earrings are just slightly smaller than dimes, so they're pretty big.<br />Unfortunately, day two of wearing them, I noticed one of my ears was starting to itch/burn. When I took them out, the burning ear had a perfect circle of bright red, crusty, bumpy irritation where the earring sat. The other ear was also starting to form the same irritation, but wasn't quite as bad at that point. They've been sitting in a drawer ever since. I can't bring myself to throw them away, considering who got them for me.<br /><br />After seeing all the other reviews that mention this same reaction, I wouldn't recommend. Buyer beware!",Neutral
"This is great when it is open for climbing, and I do like that it folds up. However, my 12 month old is able to push it around the room, and will push it into a wall or couch and is able to close it on his own. It then falls and is very heavy! Luckily it hasn't landed on him yet, but I wish there was a lock feature so that it would stay in the triangle position.",Neutral
Photo showed an emerald cut not a weird pear shape but for the money it's ok.,Neutral

I was expecting a little bit bigger stones but worth the price,Neutral
It is very obvious that it is 3d printed and makes it look cheap on my setup. Would probably look better if it was at least sanded smooth.,Neutral
"These are a ok size, but you can hardly see any of the iridescence, if that’s what you call it? Also at least 2 out of the 5 pieces had cracks throughout them.",Neutral
Well made but only about as long as a AA battery.,Neutral
The color of the wood is darker than photo advertised and the lettering type is hard to tell what the names say.,Neutral
"The runes are messy, some missing or incorrect. The pieces themselves are fairly small, which I don't mind, but I'm not excited at how difficult these are to read because of how poorly they were made. Otherwise I like them.<br />I got a really nice gift with this set that makes me unlikely to return it, even though the runes are what I actually ordered, and are not very clear. The pendulum sent with it is so pretty though, and I did get it all for a very good price, defects and all. Good enough if it's cheap (I paid like $9), but if you are wanting something that is gifting quality or a bit more finished, probably keep looking. My pieces do have a good amount of flash.",Neutral
"I really like the design of this rock, but for the price, it could be a bit bigger. Was pretty limited on space for the engraving on the back side and would have liked more room for additional characters. Overall, a nice expensive rock!",Neutral
it is so cute but very small,Neutral
Seems well made but the sizing is off.  Bought a Comeaux hat at the same time and was the same size. The Comeaux hat fit perfectly.,Neutral
Okay for the price,Neutral
Didn't realize it was just an insert and did not include the binder.,Neutral
"Stone is bigger then I thought it would be, chain is fine but a true 22 inch necklace. I like it but I won’t go with what I wanted to pair it with. I will keep it and hopefully find something else to pair it with.",Neutral
"Update: One of the hooks broke after second wearing.  Because of the shiny metal, it will be difficult to replace with the same effect.  Disappointing.  Color is beautiful.  Lovely shape and size.  -Mrs RIco",Neutral
"Not nearly  the size I was expecting. It's  super tiny. Craftsmanship is great though  7"" x12""""",Neutral
Only thing I didn't like it was wrong size sent. But a nice tshirt.,Neutral
Flimsy and not much use to hold things but shipping back too pricey to return. The floral fabric is cute. Would not recommend.,Neutral
My boyfriend and I wore these for about 2 weeks and both of our strings started to fall apart. The bracelets are super cute! Just wish they would have lasted longer.,Neutral
Very small chain. Child size. Pendant is very appealing however,Neutral
I had to the the money clip out on the back porch for three days to air it out the odor was so bad.,Neutral
"This is a cool looking bracelet.  However, I have been wearing it for about a week and I do not notice any of the anti-fatigue, or an increase in spiritual positivity.<br /><br />It wears well, and looks good on a man's wrist. It's adjustable, and is wearable for most any size wrist.  If you were purchasing for a female, it may be a bit large.  I have received a couple compliments, saying ""that's a different kind of bracelet"", and ""it looks cool"".",Neutral
Not true to size.,Neutral
"Ok, starfish looks cheap.",Neutral
"Disappointed , that the back side had no color or punish on it.",Neutral
Small and quality not what I expected. Was going to use outside my condo but not sure. Description of product needs to be updated.,Neutral
"My partner purchased this ring as a birthday present for me. He had previously purchased another item from this vendor, a pair of mermaid earrings, which I adore. He purchased this well before my birthday, and because he wanted to ensure it would be here before my birthday, it paid the + $25.00 for priority shipping. My birthday was the 9th, I received the ring on the 14th. If the quality of the ring was that of the earrings I had received, I may have been ok with the fact that it was late, but the bezel of the ring catches my hair every time I ran my fingers through it, and it has caught on my shirt and trousers when I was getting dress this morning. So its a nice ring, but the quality and price are simply not worth it.",Neutral
"Too tight, it pops off my hearing aids.",Neutral
I got cheaper rings that haven’t faded yet this ring faded pretty quick and I wear the other ones more than this one,Neutral
Super tiny not the size I needed but I made it work,Neutral
"When I got this there were frayed wires around the arrowhead that would poke me every time I wrote it. Then about a week after I bought it it just broke randomly while I was wearing it. Luckily the fraying metal strong kept and beads groom falling off, but it broke where the arrowhead was. Also luckily out fell down my undershirt which was tucked in so the arrowhead didn't break... But now I just have a bunch of beads. Don't know how I'm gonna string them up again.",Neutral
"i really want to give this sweater 5 stars because the first one i received (color sand, size M) was perfect. it fit as expected and it’s very soft and thick. i ordered another one because i loved the first one so much. unfortunately the second one i received (color white, size M) was made with a different brand sweater. it was way thinner than the first one and the size was a little on the larger side. still both cute sweaters but if you want them in all the colors then expect different quality sweaters.",Neutral
Like,Neutral
"These are small and cute. If you like the nose ring to be small then this is perfect, or if you have a small nose. These would be great for teens who's moms don't want to let their kid get a nose ring. Overall these are made good, they don't hurt when in the nose and they are sturdy. I recommend.",Neutral
It’s nice but for the price I would think it would be better.  I am going to make a new one with my Cricut which is what I should have done in the first place.,Neutral
"I bought this in October of 2020 and LOVED it. However, soon after it began constantly falling off the chain/cord. I have been unable to fix the issue but loved it so much that I was willing to keep putting it back on. However, now it is January of 2021 and my rainbow is gone 😔",Neutral
Looked beautiful for a little bit but unfortunately it does tarnish if you aren’t really careful. Other than that it’s wonderful,Neutral
Was a little bummed when this came in the mail. I ended up returning it because the graphic design was lighter in person and almost looked faded.,Neutral
Cute. As pictured. Not a good quality hand towel. Definitely decorative,Neutral
Wife really liked this.  I should have gotten a slightly bigger one.,Neutral
thanks,Neutral
"I bought this out of curiosity...lotion bar?  Hmm.  It's an interesting option.  The oils in it heat up as you rub it on, which takes away the soap texture that you initially feel.  Although it does have a lavender scent, the oils that it is made with also come through, and they're not especially pleasant.",Neutral
It's pretty but I don't think it's worth the price. I didn't read the size...my fault. For the price I expected it to be bigger and heavier. It is very light weight and pretty small.,Neutral
"It smells good, but the directions are tiny. I cannot even read them with my glasses on. The are no directions on Amazon either.",Neutral
Not as clear as advertised,Neutral
"After receiving the bracelets, the color shown is NOT what I received, the one I received was much darker, but just so happens it matched perfectly with the shirt I was wearing, so I kept them that’s why I gave three stars, still pretty!!",Neutral
Like the design of these small earrings but I wished they will be more substantial. It’s a thin gold wire with a half moon shape.,Neutral
"Super cute ring and I love that I can design what the ring says. I have worn this ring everyday for the past 4 days. I take it off when I shower, wash my hands, cook, and sleep. However, I have noticed that the ring is starting to turn black around the edges. It has not turned my finger green at all. I just wish it wasn't turning black. I got it in silver by the way.",Neutral
"Loved trying these before I got my nose pierced and it was cool but, it fell out easily",Neutral
"They are beautiful . Easy to thread through. But delicate. The stone  pulled off through its loop, I managed  to put it back on and clamped it togather. Will take it to a jewelry  repair shop and have the loop that  holds the stone welded. Just be careful when pulling them out of your ears",Neutral
Colors are not brilliant and it faded on the first wash.,Neutral
quality just ok,Neutral
"I like the wooden name a lot. But, it had flaws. First, i had to sand the edges of the name because the edges weren’t smooth & pieces of wood were sticking out. (like wood tearout)<br />Second, I paid extra for it to be painted white. It was painted nicely besides the back of the dot that goes on the “i”. It was dirty & not painted. I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good. Just disappointing when you pay that much money & the product has these issues with it that i had to take the time to fix / edit to make it right.",Neutral
look great framed,Neutral
Always great service from Amazon. Not exactly what I wanted.,Neutral
"Too small, chain to thin, tarnished QUICKLY!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$!",Neutral
I thought  they were too small.,Neutral
Now I get that these are custom. But I doubt they’re in so high demand as to take as long as it did to get to my friends. Took two months.<br /><br />On the flip side she really enjoyed it and said it looks great.,Neutral
"I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas. First of all, the message said to my son and the inscription on inside said love forever.  The bag it came in said to my grandson.  Unfortunately since it said that I didn't check. The bracelet itself is great.  Just disappointed it wasn't to my grandson.",Neutral
"It was very small, not as pictured.",Neutral
It is what you pay for. Frames are jot included so keep that in mind as it is not clearly stated in the description.,Neutral
3” is small and hard to read. Go for a bigger size.,Neutral
"Cute design, but I’m doubting the inks are premium as they look more subdued (less pigmented) and a bit pixelated in real life, at least the ones I received. Plus, several of my stickers on one sheet look like black ink from another print job smeared on them... very unpolished looking. See uploaded image for detail. Item also arrived later than expected and when I’d sent an inquiry to the seller, I never did receive a response. So customer service appears to be lacking as well.",Neutral
"Ehh, not what I was expecting. Quality is disappointing.",Neutral
Too big for me.,Neutral
A little disappointed in the quality. I knew it wouldn't be much for the price but it just seems very cheap and doesn't look as nice and big as the picture.,Neutral
"Item isn't heavy enough, scoots around on table.",Neutral
"Very cute and clever Christmas Tree Ornament to mark a most memorable year.  It arrives in a small gift box which makes it easy for gifting.  Please note that it's made of entirely paper, bakery string and a pasted copy printed inscription. The latter makes me think that as far as longevity in lasting for years to come, not so much.  Also, I know it's handmade but the price is steep for the materials used.  I've taken some photos and hope that they help you a bit in your decision.  It would be easier for me to recommend at a more reasonable price or if made with more longer lasting materials.  Thank you.",Neutral
Está muy bonita,Neutral
"These are excellent quality, perfect weight, even though a tiny bit heavy, hangs beautifully... The BIG BUT: 925 is stamped, quite largely, on the front of the teardrop. Can't miss it, it's so disappointing. I've worn them around the house, they feel wonderful but everytime I glanced at a mirror, the 925 jumped out. I even went back<br />to the site page and enlarged the earring to see if mine was an error so I could return them but even on the site page, there was the 925 on the front.<br />Who wants that? I can't wear these out anywhere, so I guess I'll wear them while housecleaning!!",Neutral
"Thought it was going to be like an canvas or even in some kind of a frame. No, it's just a flat picture. Cute though but I'll have to find frames for these if I want them hanged up.",Neutral
So far I like it as it appears it will protect my Iphone10. However it took long time getting to my home. I was not aware that it was coming from outside the country.  If I had know that I am not sure I would have ordered it. I does look just like the picture.,Neutral
"This was a really great necklace. I gifted this to my fiancé and the craftsmanship was terrific. I rated three stars because it’s starting to fade away like a cheap necklace from Claire’s. That’s the only thing, but other than that, great good.",Neutral
"Downgrading from 5 to 3 stars because the floral/filigree bits at the base of the earring kept catching on everything (hair, clothing, mask) and eventually started to bend and break off. This happened after only a couple times wearing them. I repaired them, removing that problem part. But the look of the earring isn't the same.<br /><br />Earrings are quite a bit larger and heavier than they appear.<br /><br />Will purchase from seller again (I own other items & like them), but not this particular style.",Neutral
It started falling apart as my mother opened it. I was ver embarrassed!,Neutral
I love the different stones they’re beautiful… I don’t like how difficult it is to clasp the band and the heart. I also work outside so the band looks filthy because of the light color. I also love that I had extra room to adjust the band ( I have a large wrist)… the band is durable again I work outside…,Neutral
Wasn’t what I expected. See through and thin. Not the greatest quality print.,Neutral
"Probably if I had read a bit more I would have realized how big these are.  Unfortunately for me, I did not read and they are huge for my little pots.  I still used 3 of them, and will probably use the rest when I get them planted.  I also thought the shipping was a bit high, but that might just be me.<br />The plant markers themselves are very nice and would work well indoors or out.  So with them item itself I have no complaints.",Neutral
"This reads blue.  Close up, detailed picture takes you back to spring.  If you're looking for purple tones like I was, I'd pass on this.  kGreat picture, just wish it was a true purple.",Neutral
"I really like this product, except the hook came out within 2 weeks. Now it is no longer wearable",Neutral
This ring is very interesting to look at and is made of sturdy material BUT you can tell by the image that it is a bit odd shaped. I have a pretty average/standard ring finger size (7) but this ring was so big that I couldn't even wear it on my thumb. I have adjusted it but if I adjust it too much more it will go from interesting looking to cheap looking and I also worry that adjusting it a lot will weaken the metal.,Neutral
I love the color and the look. The only problem is that it burns fast and when putting it out sends so much smoke in to my room.,Neutral
Nice me and my wife love them but they don’t stay hooked so we lost both of them socks,Neutral
Great night light and very cute.  But did not realize that it has no on/off switch.  My mistake.,Neutral
My size is 7.5 on my right hand. I ordered a 7.5 and it's very tight. The seller will accept returns but you pay for shipping. The ring is so cheap it's not worth paying to send back.,Neutral
Really liked the nag champa. The dragons blood smells decent but very weak. The patchouli is very very plastic smelling and the patchouli is very faint.,Neutral
It is my mistake for missing the product description but for $8.99 I really expected plastic and not a piece of foam with a sticker on it that will just peal after a couple uses. It make my daughter Happy and I guess that’s all that matters.,Neutral
I did not realize these had plastic post instead of metal. Have never seen that before and do not like.,Neutral
"I waited 2 months for this to finally reach my mailbox. I’m not sure if it’s real silver, there isn’t any stamp 925 on the ring. The sizing runs small so order a size up. It’s pretty but because because of the issues I had I’ll never order from this seller again.",Neutral
"It was good, not great. It fit well. It was a challenge to align. It wrinkled and delaminated around the face at the overlap.",Neutral
"Cheaply made, but you wouldn’t notice while wearing.",Neutral
"Beautiful and good quality, but it MUST be shipped in a box. I got mine wrinkled and bent. I was able to straighten it out and it's in a dimly lit area but if I were buying it as a gift, I'd have returned it.",Neutral
Smaller than anticipated and it came in a plastic bag not even a box. Found out from my friend that the clasp broke first time she wore it.  I finally asked last night why she doesn’t wear it so she told me it’s been broken.,Neutral
Runs small...<br />Tòo thin to be even noticed...,Neutral
Stone is good quality but about half the size of the photo.,Neutral
"I expected the pole to be sturdy in this price range, it is not.  The slate is what really bugs me.  I paid for slate so it would look like slate.  The back is great! But the engraved front is covered with a protective coating that makes it look like plastic instead of slate.",Neutral
It was very cheaply made.  I had to buy a mate and expensive frame to dress it up.,Neutral
Very cheap looking and discolored.,Neutral
"No me agrado el escrito, casi ni se nota el nombre i la tinta se borra y mancha",Neutral
"When I peel them off, part of the paper they are on comes with it.  I can get the extra paper off but it takes some effort. Wish they peeled off easier.",Neutral
"These are really cute but boy were they hard to put on! The first time I wanted to wear them, I had to give up because it was time to go to the event! The next day I tried again and after at least 20 minutes I finally got the first one in!<br /><br />Once they're on, they really are lovely, very light.",Neutral
"Very trendy fashion gadget. But as pucture shows, iteam received has torn leather on buckles end",Neutral
I ughh not have read the full description.  But these would be better if they were clear stickers.  But a surprise it was a while sheet of stickers.,Neutral
When they say “prints” they literally mean a Fuji film print. I could have printed these from Walmart. Thankfully my little nephew didn’t know the difference when I put them in a frame.,Neutral
The lettering foe the names is very small,Neutral
"I liked the quote and I am a fan of Manuel Miranda.<br />The quote was printed in good paper, but the printing was sloppy, in my view.<br />For this piece, the price is too high.",Neutral
"I have purchased this soap in the past with great results. The one thing is this soap disappears so fast. Sure, store it, hid it, etc. For $10.00 a bar I think I wil look else where next purchase. Peace",Neutral
The picture on each balloons came out really nice but I filled them up with the helium tank that you would buy from Walmart and the balloons didn’t float at all. I guess they were made out of a heavy material or there’s a different helium to use? They were still a hit at my daughters 21st but I which they would of floated… I was a little bummed about that. We just put tape on the back and stuck them to the walls. But great picture quality on the balloons.,Neutral
"I love the look, feel, and quality. However, it doesn’t stay tight on my wrist. I have to tighten it often. Being a mother to young children and an active person, I move my arms and hands a lot.<br />It seems like the band loosens a bit every time I move.",Neutral
sticks out on the side. A little bulky. But I love opal and im getting used to it. Still very pretty.,Neutral
It’s thick and takes up too much space and takes too long to revive. It’s ok.,Neutral
I order cuffs and ti pin. Tie pin did not come in. Requesting a credit to my card,Neutral
Look good on the picture but a little cheap in real life,Neutral
"I loved the necklace, but the chain broke after a week of having it. If you purchase it, buy your own chain",Neutral
Came off,Neutral
Chain stains your skin when you sweat.,Neutral
"Very cute, but the ball/charms are not as pronounced as in the picture.",Neutral
The sign itself is good but the clips that it comes with are super junky.,Neutral
It was smaller than I thought but good quality,Neutral
Love the soap but the sponge was too small,Neutral
"I purchased the decal to put on our new cooler, very disappointed after the first use.  The 2 of the letters has already fallen off after using the cooler.",Neutral
"The price of these bracelets are great. They do not last a long time as the string gets worn out fast and snap easily. Mine lasted about 2 weeks before breaking and the other one broke 2 days after that. They are cute, abd the magnetic heart didnt connect properly unless you adjust it to create the heart. It's cute for a short time.",Neutral
"While this is crafted well, , for the price I expected way more opal to shine through.  It looks like a quartz necklace more then anything which makes me sad. To me not worth the price paid",Neutral
The gold option looks bronze,Neutral
Kool idea . one was perfect one not so great. Engraved a little close to edge. If not for this engraved misalignment I would give 5 stars . but for this alone I give them 3 stars .. Wifes looks great just mine the heart is right on the edge. Little disapointed as time passes I think its going to look well crappy..,Neutral
I love these glasses but the sparkles fall off so very easy,Neutral
Pricey but there are no other cheaper options . I think it is well made but still falls off the chair all the time .<br />I ended up buying a $7 towel heavy duty ... Works better,Neutral
Was hoping for a rounded stone as was shown in photos...but maybe I can say it's a dog's head?!,Neutral
Cutest bracket set ever! It was a gift for my gf and she loved it. Mine unfortunately frayed after two days of wearing it. It’s been two weeks and it is holding up completely still.,Neutral
My daughter loved it and put it on immediately. Unfortunately the Cham came off and she lost it about an hour after she put it on.,Neutral
Much smaller than in picture,Neutral
"I tried for about 20 min to get the ring to sit correctly with no luck. I did stretch them out quite a bit, but was worried about stretching them too much and them loosing their shape completely. I was able to get them I to the nose ring hole itself, just couldn't get it to situate correctly. This is the first one I've tried since getting the actual piercing. I really wanted these to work :(",Neutral
"I'm starting it off with 3 stars mainly because I've only been using it for 2 days and for the price I expected more. The size of the bar is about average but it would have been nice to get a mesh bag with it. Also the description says an easy rich lather which I have not got anywhere close to with my hands or a wash cloth. It does feel very nice on my skin and I suppose barely smelling it is better than being overwhelmed. That being said I've already noticed less of my natural smell than before which was my goal since ""natural"" has become stronger since I had my last child and going into menopause. I also prefer not to smell like fruit or the rose soaps I have smelled previously.",Neutral
"The shirt appears to be a trendy, cute tie up in the picture, but arrived as an oversized T shirt instead.",Neutral
I like the product but unfortunately it is bent.,Neutral
They looked great at first. A few times after wearing them they lost their shine. They seem to be all plastic. In the picture it appeared as metal fastenings around the stone and that is not the case.,Neutral
"The metal was a little thin, but that makes it light weight. The etching was perfect. Pleased with aesthetics.",Neutral
The earring is really pretty but it wont stay in.  Unless I'm missing something will return it.,Neutral
"Cute, but I prefer the tie-type scarf.  This scarf wouldn't stay put and kept ending up on the back of dog's neck.",Neutral
"In the picture provided it shows the ribbon already tied into a bow, but they are already cut and not tied.  I also felt they were expensive.  I do appreciate the seller was accommodating when I needed to change the date of the wedding",Neutral
Love my rings I wear them everyday just disappointed that the bold black color of my kids names has already came off.,Neutral
"Pretty and fine, but they do bend with use. They are lightweight though, so to be expected I suppose on the the more flexible wire.",Neutral
"It's nice. Don't think it's worth the price tho.<br />However, it IS real leather. I bought a couple others of Amazon that said, ""genuine leather.""<br />That was a lie. Not with this case tho. It's the real deal.",Neutral
"Just okay.  Not bad, but not great.",Neutral
Loses scent.,Neutral
Dough stuck to the cutter even after dipping it in flour but cheaper that a wooden mold.,Neutral
I purchased thinking they were nose rings and weren't more like little hope earrings.,Neutral
"I love the picture, it is printed very nicely but I was no expecting it to just be a flimsy peice of paper. Maybe I didn't read the description thoroughly enough but I was expecting it to be thicker and not something I could print myself.",Neutral
Well made but only about as long as a AA battery.,Neutral
"My ring broke randomly while I was looking at it. However, I did get a couple months use out of it wearing it full time. The rose petals also dry up and turn brown after a while.",Neutral
really happy with the product but i did lose an earring after a few days. the post back is short which makes it comfortable to wear but maybe too short to keep the earring back on for long periods of time. i ordered another pair to replace it since i loved them so much hopefully will not have the same problem.,Neutral
I am so sad. I loved these earrings so much but they are not for every day use unfortunately. Both of the stones have fallen off at different times and I'm unable to find them so now I just have the posts. They are beautiful and perfect for all occasions BUT not for every day wear.,Neutral
Way smaller than I thought. But really pretty and good quality,Neutral
"All of these kinds of products are subjective and dependant on the users reality. Although this product is cute and relatively sturdy, it might also not be completely natural as some people define the word. It does seem to have shavings or shards of stones and placed in a resign. I didn't expect more than that. I have only worn this necklace a handful of times. The first time I felt horrible and then realized I had covid. Then after healing it seemed to have some sort of calming affect especially for my chest. I have had heart issues in the past so this was a pleasant surprise. But the chord isnt that comfortable on my skin and the back end of the chord shifts and pulls the pendant up my chest. But thats most likely because of my weight and shape in that area. So very subjective. I try to stay open to all forms of healing and natural elements. I probably just need more on skin contact with stones. But this might work for you as either a style choice and/or healing properties if your in that state of mind/energy/reality.",Neutral
I’m much more confident and able to explain myself well when wearing this crystal. Reason for 3 stars was the chain broke in the first week. I just moved the crystal to another chain. But would have liked for it not to break ofcourse.,Neutral
Overpriced,Neutral
"I've only had these for a few days. Working well so far. I've had similar ones before that were cloth, but they wore out and I've been looking for a replacement. Well made from what I can tell so far.  Thank you.",Neutral
"It’s nice, but seems like it may break easily",Neutral
"The etching is beautiful, but the glass is too small for my taste.",Neutral
"After awhile the plating begins to chip off,",Neutral
"These are very well done and added a great touch to my kitchen.  However I only gave it three stars for the fact that I was planning on putting these in an 11x16 matted frame for an 8x10 image and there isn't any border on the print to fit what I had in mind.  I do love them, but can only give 3 stars for that reason.",Neutral
"I love the shape of these earrings, but they bend too easily and lose their shape. I have to work on them every time I wear them.",Neutral
Not thrilled. Definitely not worth the nearly $20 I spent. Almost looks slightly blurry but will keep since I don’t feel like hunting down another first Christmas ornament after Christmas,Neutral
"Neat , creative idea but just waaaay to expensive for a piece of thick sheet of paper. Could have also included some clips or a board to get the sheet on for the guests. Great idea but overpriced .",Neutral
It's pretty but I don't think it's worth the price. I didn't read the size...my fault. For the price I expected it to be bigger and heavier. It is very light weight and pretty small.,Neutral
Covers county name and renewal sticker on Ohio license plates,Neutral
Love the shape and how light they are but sadly they’re thin enough to break. I traveled with them once and that’s all it took. Be careful!,Neutral
Child’s gift.,Neutral
The wood is unsealed.  I'll likely paint or seal it.,Neutral
I recently bought this and it is really cute but it doesn't close completely and I wish it did. otherwise great for the price.,Neutral

They aren't really from the actual comic which I get copyright and all but they are fanart hope they are getting credit,Neutral
We really wanted to try this product but the bag was opened.  Not sure if it happened in transit.  Would love a replacement!,Neutral
"I was expecting a larger mask,  NOT returnable.",Neutral
"Unfortunately, they are too large. My father is a size small and these fit like medium to large. They really should come in different sizes. Otherwise, very good quality. Lettering was exactly what I ordered.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought but very pretty and dainty,Neutral
I ordered an I. When it came it looked like a J. Then I realized it hadn't been totally finished on the bottom after looking at at the pictures of what it was supposed to look like.,Neutral
Very cute necklace but it is so tiny that it constantly tangles up.  Every time I walk the Lariat part tangles around the necklace. If it was not for this I would give a 5 star as it is cute and very petite.,Neutral
"Love the scent, doesn't last a long time but it stills smells good.  I have my warmer on 24/7 so I pretty much use 1 cube every 2 days, I have the door to my br closed sink don't lose the scent.  This one is as close as I can find to really smelling like roses, I don't like anything else mixed with it.",Neutral
"It arrived broken, its super light weight not for practical ouija use haha that’s for sure. Decretive novelty piece.",Neutral
I wish the back was a little more sturdier. Otherwise ok.,Neutral
"The problem is, Sam doesn't say Puh Tey Tohs. He says Poh Tey Tohs.",Neutral
It was very beautiful upon arrival. But 3 weeks later it’s started changing color 😩,Neutral
"I don't like it very much. It feels well made although I don't like the leather, it just doesn't feel &#34;nice&#34; to me. While it fits my Cadet SAK and the Space Pen, the metal lug scratches the knife and will wear down the alox. Overall it also makes the two pieces much more bulky in my pocket. Not going to use it. Bummer.",Neutral
"The writing is so small you really can’t tell it’s writing.  If you bought it larger, you may be able to read it, but the print is such a small part of it.  They just really need to make more of the words show up.",Neutral
It was a good novelty tee but after a few washes and yes hand washing and mechanical it faded away to relly unseeble,Neutral
I was disappointed when this arrived and this was probably my fault but I thought it was 3inches per letter not 3inches per whole thing. I guess next time I’ll have to read better.,Neutral
"Came damaged, also the stars are not painted white so it doesn’t match the stripes. Doesn’t look good.",Neutral
That came in and a reasonable time period the lid that originally comes with it doesn't fit proper proper. And it doesn't keep your hot beverages hot long enough.,Neutral
I was kind of disappointed with the size of them I expected something much bigger. They are cute though otherwise,Neutral
"I wanted a smaller fidget, that was colorful and cute, for my daughter to use in school.  Yet, this is colorful and cute, it is to small and it doesn’t really move around much.  You can feel the rings just not fidget with it which defeats the purpose of why I bought it in the first place.  My daughter asked for another one, just larger.",Neutral
Style was good,Neutral
"I REALLY wanted to love this product. I’m such a fan of a good lemongrass scent, in which you smell in the packaging. As soon as you activate the wax into an oil you smell absolutely NOTHING, literally nothing. You smell it more while it’s in its package rather than it being heated. I’m really disappointed in this one because like I said, I really wanted to love it.",Neutral
Very fun and soft looking. Looks impressive however it doesn't seem to hold the powder that well.  I'm not thrilled with it but will continue to use it until I can find something that may suit my needs better.,Neutral
It’s not as nice as expected. But once ironed it worked,Neutral
"Whoever packed it in my box placed a bunch of items on this photo so I literally have a cheap piece of wrinkled dictionary paper. I still have to go buy a frame and try to flatten it in a coffee table book. It's supposed to be a Birthday present for a friend but I am ashamed to give this to anyone now that it's wrinkled/damaged. Not worth the money damaged and with no picture frame. All in all, it sucks.",Neutral
These pieces were very nice and fit just right in my palm. Fast shipping. One arrived chipped a piece broken off the top but it gave it some character. Overall not too bad for value,Neutral
My fault for not paying attention to fact frame not included.  Paper sign only is not worth the money.,Neutral
Corners want to curl up,Neutral
"I really wanted to love these.  I thought they were a great idea for the very end of a period when the flow is next to nothing, or to help direct flow to the center of a pad.  And they are great for both of those things, just not great for me.  I find them irritating no matter how I fold or roll them.  Probably great for others, just not super sensitive people like me.",Neutral
"I was hoping for a red color book in the mix, but no.",Neutral
"I’m so happy I ordered the ‘18k Gold’ set of rings/hoops!! They’re so beautiful & dainty. I’ve been on the hunt for a very snug nose ring so the variety of sizes in the set was perfect. I currently have 1 in my nose piercing & 2 in my lobes. They were super easy to bend & adjust, they are very delicate so just be careful not to bend too aggressively. These have a high-end & sleek look without breaking the bank, I highly recommend these!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/9/23: full transparency- I’m taking off 2 stars with this updated review. These have held up fairly well. The hoops in my ears are still perfect. My main complaint is that the gold has rubbed off the hoop that I have in my nose piercing. I guess that’s to be expected with something that is only gold filled wire, although it says ‘the gold layer is thick’. It’s clearly fairly thin because I’ve had other gold filled nose rings that have lasted a years without rubbing off. I’m disappointed since the hoop in my nose is the perfect ‘snug’ size & I have had trouble finding one until now.",Neutral
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it looks very cheap,Neutral
"I got this for my wife and she loved it. Loved the engraving and the soft leather.<br />After wearing about a week though, she now has staining on her wrist where the clasp is. Not sure if anyone else has encountered this, but this is typically a sign of inferior craftsmanship.<br />If not for this skin staining due to the clasp, I would definitely have given a higher rating.",Neutral
"They don’t stay gold. After just a couple months use, the gold finish started to rub off. Now I have one silver and one that’s half silver and half gold. Not worth $60. Not even sure if the gem is real.",Neutral
I was really excited about this purchase. The ring came relatively quickly. I was in love.I wore this ring everyday. But after about a month of wearing it. The ring is starting to change color. 😔,Neutral
"I gave them an over all 3 star only because of the font. I liked the overall look, they seem sturdy and durable. The font though, has weird spacing from the first letter to the rest of the name and wasn’t online with it. My fiancé even was a little off put by it (had him look cause I thought I was being to picky). Other then that, the colors were exactly as described.",Neutral
Braclet is not as pictured. It's very thin and cheap looking.,Neutral
No to bad for price,Neutral
"Loved this product! Excellent bleaching on this tee. However, it was too small and seller will not answer messages about exchanging the shirt. Returning the item will cost me nearly $4 in USPS fees so it is not worth it. I ordered another shirt from this seller and bleaching was not as good (off center), but it was the correct size I needed.",Neutral
"My son thought it was be fun and loved it. However after a few times wearing it, the outside of his nose became irritated so he stopped.  Would Probably be fine for one time use, not as an everyday accessory",Neutral
Just like pictured...BUT a little wobbly...the taller bar won't hold the bracelets,Neutral
They look great but still irritated my skin enough that I can’t wear them. I opened them correctly but still have trouble with them closing completely. Wish it would’ve worked for me because they are beautiful.,Neutral
Leather is great was disappointed that the hardware did not match what was pictured. Part that holds the keys is chrome instead of brass.,Neutral
The pearl already fell of my necklace. It's only been a week. The black lettering is also fading.,Neutral
Guess that’s what I pay for but comfort kept getting into my hair and falls out and got stuck but delivery was nice and the earring was nice but not very well for a twist I wish it was click in instead,Neutral
"Loved it when received! But the letters are wearing off, no direct sunlight on rug and we use the garage door to get in the house. So we don’t step on rug much.",Neutral
"Okay so this slime was good but I noticed it smelled like they made it with paint, and the more I played with it the more the bead come out . But it’s a good product .",Neutral
"Was nicely crafted; however, I didn't check before the day of my wedding, but I realized that our wedding date was left off of the sign.",Neutral
"My case broke a month after using it, it is super cute but is just not very durable.",Neutral
"Apart from being a print that anyone could print at home and incredibly overly priced, it made an amazing gift for someone who is a dancer.",Neutral
Read the dimensions...it's SMALL!,Neutral
"The paper, while a decent weight and seemed decent....the ""gold"" shown in the picture is nothing like that in reality.  It is more of a flat cream color with beige highlights, not at all looking like the photo where it looks metallic gold.  Also, while packaged tightly there was a  tear in one sheet. Not sure if that will be visible upon mounting, but for the price and shipping costs it's highly disappointing.<br />**After contact with vendor, I have amended to 3 stars because while there was some back and forth, ultimately they worked with me to resolve situation satisfactorily.",Neutral
"Everything looks just as expected and described. I was disappointed because despite the efforts to mail them in a rigid envelope, there are multiple dents in the vinyl that definitely show in the frames. For how expensive these were I would hope for perfection. We were in a time crunch so we used them anyway.",Neutral
These earrings are a nice size. I like that the studs are 925 sterling silver. The screw back ball shape isn't my ideal type of earring backing and is a personal choice that didn't impact my review. The main reason I gave these earrings a 3 is their lack luster. They just don't have the quality glittery effect I'm accustomed to finding in CZ stones. It's disappointing since the earrings I ordered were 6mm and present a nice size for faux diamond earrings.,Neutral
I bought this as a gift because the 5 star reviews seemed legit. The printing is nice but the stationary paper is far too thin to deserve even 4 stars. Disappointed & unimpressed.,Neutral
Shelf was not very well made. Some of the corners were off by about a half inch. Nails were sticking out in a couple areas that I had to remove. I think if a little more time and attention to detail was made it would be a nice shelf.,Neutral
Cute,Neutral
"Cute designs, but it will require additional work as it is this thin flimsy cork board and nothing else.",Neutral
"This was purchased as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend! I'm sure that the meaning behind the gallifreyan text will still be appreciated, however I do wish that the text was actual metal and not just a picture backing. I knew that the galaxy background would just be a paper backing, but I didn't realize that the gallifreyan symbol would also be part of the paper background (it's very convincing in the product picture as real metal, but not so convincing in person). I know that the description never claimed that the symbol was real metal, but for $24.95 I just assumed based on the picture that it was. It will still make a good anniversary gift, though!",Neutral
"Cute but hard to read. This doesn’t look like the stamp goes too deep, I’m not sure how long this will last",Neutral
Too small and very thin easily breakable but looks pretty.,Neutral
it was beautiful but much smaller than I anticipated. I guess I need to watch the size,Neutral
Nice quality. More delicate and dainty than expected. I was mostly disappointed that it was more rose gold than regular gold.,Neutral
These are adorable but one of the three i bought did not come with the scratch off,Neutral
Color states Area 51 but it is more of a grey color,Neutral
It is larger than I expected and the material seems cheap. I have yet to even put it in because it seems quite unappealing. It will be my “back up” if necessary but I would not wear it all day.,Neutral
I looked forward to these for my second ear hole and I can’t get hold of it to screw it back on. Very cute but I guess I’m just fumble fingered or uncoordinated. I’ll probably give these to my niece.,Neutral
"The pewter basset hound pendant tarnished, and I can't clean it to get it back to its original finish.  However, I love the detail of the basset, so I still wear it.  I keep it in remembrance of my deceased basset hound.",Neutral
"Was so excited to find this product - sadly, I should have read the description better...IT IS TINY!! All the fun and impact of the ornament is lost since it's hardly recognizable on a tree unless you are a foot or two away and closely inspecting the ornament. The photos on Amazon are clearly closeups and not a great representation of how this will (not) stand out on your tree. It's even too shall to decorate a package or be placed in the house somewhere as a decoration. I had planned on giving this as a gift to a huge Bill Murray fan, but it's size is problematic and embarrassing, especially considering the cost.",Neutral
This isn’t exactly what I had in mind when I purchased it. I wanted to use it for cleaning purposes but is hard to do when it comes with the herbs in the bottle.,Neutral
"I love her jewelry, as I have bought from  her before and being a Wizard of Oz fan, this bracelet suits me.  However, her charms falls off very easily from the bracelets I have bought, especially the ruby slippers, so beware of that.",Neutral
Beautiful piece,Neutral
"If it didn't stained my few shirts with red color, I would have given 5 star rating. Corals are natural and don't release color however this coral was dyed to make it nicer and darker looking. Looks and feels original though.",Neutral
Pretty but very small - better for a young girl,Neutral
My fault for not checking size but it’s extremely small! Would be nice for a desk or something close up. Definitely wouldn’t have paid what I did if I would have checked the size,Neutral
"This needle minder is adorable but the magnets are charged so they won’t line up-which doesn’t make it very sturdy since very little of the magnets are touching. Bummer, but still cute!",Neutral
The rods are very bendable .after wearing once they bent,Neutral
They turned very fast.,Neutral
"I have had this personalized doormat for less than 6 weeks. It is in a covered front porch area but got wet when it rained ONCE. It dried out completely but never went back to its original light color. It’s dark (wet-looking but totally dry) now and much harder to see the personalized print anymore. I LOVED it and am so disappointed. (Photos are before and after - both 100% dry, same time of day, outside, no filter other than cropping.)",Neutral
"It's ok, not real impressed with it.",Neutral
This patch looked great in the end but it took a way more heat & way longer to attach than other iron ons. This was the only iron on colts patch I could find though. I would but it again. Just be aware it takes A LOT of heat & time compared to other iron ons.,Neutral
"I don't think anyones head is big enough to fit this hat. after fixing it, it's nice.",Neutral
Color was little different then I expected,Neutral
This print is less then what I expected.  The paper that its printed on is thinner then regular printer paper.  Its closer to tissue paper when felt.  Worst poster print I ever bought thru Amazon.  I wonder how long it will take to turn brittle and yellow.  See lots of 5 stars.  I guess to each his/her own!!,Neutral
"I love the style of these earrings. They have a nice feel and look to be pretty well made. However, I have a hard time believing the ear hook is actually 925 Sterling, because they irritate my ears after just a few hours of wear. Disappointing, since I specifically sought out brands that were 925 knowing it was a metal that didn’t cause a reaction with my skin.",Neutral
looks great should work if i can find a swarm,Neutral
Note that description.  I thought was metal sign but printed in photo paper.  My fault as the description says it.,Neutral
The top cover doesn’t stay on. Good thing there’s something that connects it but it beats the purpose. Kinda sad.,Neutral
"I got this for my mom for mother’s day. Upon receiving it, I’m not 100% sure the emerald is real. It looks pretty, but not legit. I may have it looked at. My mom is also scared to wear the necklace because the clasp may not keep it secure.",Neutral
It's cute but was expecting something more than a thin piece of ribbon to hold it around the bottle,Neutral
"I honestly loved this tag! Even though it is cute, I don’t recommend buying the charm because it’ll wear down or mark the tag. If they sent S-hooks or something more durable to pair with the tag, I’d probably bump up to 5 stars, but I think it’s the combination of the chain link closure and the thin keychain-type ring to attach to the dog collar that led to the loss of it within a week. I did use plier to close the links, but alas, it still got loose. Buy the tag, but purchase some durable s-hooks to keep it on.",Neutral
"Was very large for a little kid! The ears should be adjustable, I had to buy my own clips",Neutral
I had 3 apron and they work great . I order some more and the fabric it’s very silky and thin.,Neutral
"I have two cats and while the spray worked well on the older cat, the younger kitten was not deterred from scratching up the couch and other furniture I sprayed. So, it sort of works, I guess it just depends on your cat",Neutral
I placed two separate orders for these bc I wanted to try them out at first to see how the colors matched my walls. The first batch ordered are a richer/deeper color pallet while the second bunch is much lighter. I preferred the darker set as they complement my walls better.,Neutral
"I’m so bummed. Beautiful but be careful to not have any sudden movements. I have long hair and an hour into wearing these, I went to adjust my hair and my finger got caught, pulled the whole earring off. Now it’s bent and the hook won’t even hook!<br />Such a shame.",Neutral
I purchase this for my husband and has our wedding song done. I initially purchased for our 8th anniversary and the item says bronze but it is not. It is a photo of wood grain.<br />The seller was very responsive and got the item shipped in great timing but was disappointed that it wasn’t what was advertised,Neutral
"Will not stay in without a backing, which was not provided",Neutral
"Faded badly first time was washed w/ light-colors. Lots fuzz balls on towel now, too.",Neutral
Looks cute but quality is very cheap- particularly the chain.,Neutral
"It is a very nice bracelet and I would have give. It 5 stars but they misspelled the engraved name. They sent me a new one with the correct name BUT it is clearly not the same size as the small one I original ordered. So while I appreciate the replacement, it’s useless to me. It’s HUGE!",Neutral
Looks bigger in the picture; but it’s beautiful,Neutral
"Received anemone guard without the cap, without the cap covering the front of the pumps its useless",Neutral
"Cute, but the sheets made for difficult wrapping.",Neutral
"The quality of the shirt and the printing of graphics are top-notch. The only thing keeping this from being rated 5-stars is the color of the shirt was wrong. I ordered olive green and the shirt I received was a kind of charcoal or asphalt gray color -- which is puzzling because they aren't even options color-wise.<br />I wanted green to match the colors the Orphans wear, but the shirt I received isn't any shade of green I've ever seen. I'm disappointed, but returns are too much of a hassle, so I'll leave this review instead.",Neutral
Thought these were more of an off white. They are really taupe with brown stems. Cute design but doesn't match the aesthetic I wanted,Neutral
"I bought this for a baby shower cake. It was super cute but it fell apart. Sadly, that was $30 down the drain 😢",Neutral
This is my favorite necklace... so much so that I wore it every day for two months until the wire broke and I lost the coin. I'm very upset because this was my absolute FAVORITE necklace. Beautiful necklace.. just be cautious about the wire.,Neutral
"The Pendent itself is very nice, but the chain broke within a couple of days of wear.  Luckily, I did not lose the pendent because I wear a uniform for work and it was tucked into my shirt.  I did not even realize the chain had broke until I tried to show the pendent to a co-worker.",Neutral
I love this necklace…it’s dainty and looks amazing. But my only issue is the drop piece twist and rolls up into the necklace. It needs something to weigh it down,Neutral
Taking a star off because the copper has already come off the earrings!!!,Neutral
It could not accommodate cell phone.,Neutral
"So i absolutely loved these earrings. I am sensitive to metals so I usually buy titanium only. I had no reaction to these and they felt nice while wearing them, not to mention they are beautiful. I ordered these earrings on June 1st and now on August 24th a stone has fallen out. Im very sad about this cause I really liked these earrings.",Neutral
"Like size and the two tone color<br />Wire a bit flimsy,<br />Wish they were sturdier<br />Wear them with everything",Neutral
GIFT. ORDERED SOME SMUDGE SPRAY FOR MYSELF!,Neutral
"Unfortunately I received it once it was melted due to the heat so I really didn’t get to enjoy the full usage of it and only got the aroma and loofah. But it smelled good. The little soap that was left on the loofah did go fairly quickly, but again it could have been because there wasn’t much soap left.",Neutral
"They show you the measurements of the little globe, and when I say little I mean ""little"" but it is very cute! If you like small dainty jewelry,  you will love this!",Neutral
smaller than I thought,Neutral
"This was adorable Im not sure what I expected though, it's just a photo print of the wording I guess I could of just done it myself at a much cheaper price, But I mean its adorable.",Neutral
"The bracelet was very cute. However, it was a little bit smaller than I expected, not very thick, stones were small.",Neutral
"Great graphic, great sticker. However, did not stick to my hydroflask... I peeled the paper from the sticky part and placed it directly on my hydroflask and the top part of the sticker just hung off. Sticks more like a vinyl cling. Stuck to my adventure journal perfectly so, depending on your intentions... could be perfect. Very cute!",Neutral
Much smaller than expected!,Neutral
"I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46. I did contact the vendor but got no response after waiting two weeks to write this review.",Neutral
"the print looks just the picture above, but unfortunately it wasn't packaged correctly and it has creases and was bent when I received it. I ordered it with other 2 prints. The other 2 were just fine. They had been taped to a cardboard which kept them from bending. I don't know why they didn't do the same with this one :(",Neutral
"The title of this is ""wall art"" and other such misleading wordings. It should just say photocopy, because that's what it is. It is literally an 8"" by10"" Kodak picture. Not framed. Not matted. Not on canvas or metal. Just a copy of an albeit humorous picture, but not worth $12.95. If you scroll to the 3rd or 4th picture and read the tiny little writing you'll see where it says 8 by 10 photo. Why not put that in the title? 0h! Because then people would see that and not buy it.",Neutral
"Everything about the lanyard is great, the personalization and the badge holder. I was sold because the image shows a thicker lanyard and I got a very thin one. I’m a teacher and I need something thicker to hold ID, keys, hand sanitizer, you name it, and I can tell this will hurt my neck after wearing it all day. I put my old lanyard in the picture for reference, it is a big difference. So something to keep in mind, if you hang multiple things on your lanyard.",Neutral
I loved it but after a few months it’s now turned black,Neutral
Sucks they can't be bracelets,Neutral
"Love this item, but unable to frame and gift it to my husband for Christmas due to shipper or delivery driver damaging the package which went the prints in half",Neutral
Kind of dull for a baby.,Neutral
Very bendable.,Neutral
The back popped off after a few months.,Neutral
"It is a nice ring. Very dainty and a little blue can be seen in the stone. The stone is very tiny, but it looks nice in the rose gold setting. No wonder there was not a photo of the ring on someone’s finger.",Neutral
"Nice scent, but really not strong or long-lasting",Neutral
"If you are looking for a needle minder where the needle stays magnetized to the top of the pin, this is not it. My needle will stick to the inside of the pin but it won’t stay very well. But the pin is cute.",Neutral
The case is beautiful BUT ours has one defect.  the one we received covers the microphone so we have to take the cover off to use FaceTime or speakerphone. If not for this I would have given it 5 stars,Neutral
Ripped and my son was devastated,Neutral
"Smells great, very cute.  Picture shows four, I got one.  J/s.",Neutral
I am giving a 3 because the designs are cute.  The tag itself is over priced in my opinion.  It also broke within 3 days of putting it on and wouldn't stay on after about 3 months.,Neutral
i can barely see the bee. it is tiny. And while i haven’t had a chance to break out my measuring tape i’m finding it really hard to believe this is an 18 inch necklace and it looks very cheap especially compared to the quality look of the bee,Neutral
"It keeps coming apart,  it has not broken nor is the clasp lose but it has come apart like 6 times and I have been lucky to find it",Neutral
"These earrings look nice and are light enough to not pull my ears down while I'm wearing them, but the post is flat and tall. It left my ears sore after wearing them. It is so thick, that it wouldn't even go all the way in my ears, only the very end went in and I had to be careful when clamping them. I was happy with them when I first got them and put them on, but after a day of wearing them, my ears hurt.",Neutral
"Very cute nose ring, would work better for a septum piercing because it’s quite larger than I was expecting.  Cute tho!",Neutral
Liked the style and simplicity.  However they were much smaller than the visual...really tiny. The visual was greatly magnified.,Neutral
"READ ME BEFORE ORDERING! You can change that color of the shirt BUT if you order a shirt and shorts set thinking they will be the same color thats is not the case, they only offer the shorts that are pictured. You are not getting a matching outfit. Sadly found this out the day of grandsons party and had to run out and find a different outfit. Cute outfit but not very clear when placing an order, with how much it cost I am disappointed.",Neutral
Havent purchased yet. Description says birdhouse is  10-12” in height but one review says it’s on the “smallish” side. I’d like to know the correct height at before I order. It’s a little pricey for a “smallish” piece. Thank you.,Neutral
I purchased it for my daughter who is getting married in a couple of months and lost her dad at the beginning of this year. I know that she will love it. It really is a beautiful piece but I saw one afterwards that I liked better,Neutral
I loved the purchase however it was a little smaller than anticipated and the cork was missing. I notified seller and I hope they provide one.,Neutral
Disappointed in the size. It’s too small.  It looked larger in the pictures.  The stone is pretty and so is the style.,Neutral
"If you decide to get the stamping, do not stamp on both sides, you will see the indents on the opposite side. I'm not very happy about this, and will try to return it and get one without stamping on both sides.<br /><br />It may be a little hard to see in the photo.",Neutral
"The stone appears to be multiple small stones cured in epoxy, not a solid stone.",Neutral
"The initial 'S' is too scroll-y to be identifiable as an 'S' and it is not attached to the wreath; it's a DIY. Also there is no string or hanger for hanging. Other than that, it's beautiful.",Neutral
"This looked great in my grandson's room, but when we moved him to another room I was unable to move these with him. They were difficult to remove and left a sticky mess and imprint on the wall. It does not say they are re-positionable so I cannot complain, I just want others to be aware.",Neutral
Probably buy again,Neutral
"Came too tight, wish they recommended size up for wide bands",Neutral
"One of my twins could be white, and I was expecting it on red family color.",Neutral
I like it but it is somewhat small.,Neutral
"Could have used better description when ordering to ensure I got correct facing.  I ended up ordering wrong facing and had to improvise during install.  Completely my fault, but more direction at time of order could have avoided this.",Neutral
looks really nice but does not open bottles. opening is to small.,Neutral
Smaller thank I expected,Neutral
For $13 I expected at least a clear photo that I ordered.<br />I am not a photographer but this product seems to be a picture of a picture.<br />It is very disappointing that this item is blurred and not worth framing.,Neutral
"Nice stones, leather was kinda week",Neutral
I wear it-but it is kinda cheap looking. The clasp is giant.,Neutral
"This is my 2nd pair of handmade burebure boots. They're warm, reasonably supportive, so comfortable and pretty. I love that the sole is of a natural material so when I stand on the earth, the energy in my body is corrected. Great health benefit.<br />BUT imagine my surprise when I opened my package and found, not the white lined with Grey that i ordered, but Grey lined with blue! I can't wear them with the outfits I'd planned to. Since burebure does not accept returns, I accept these boots with good grace. :-)",Neutral
"I got this as a gift for my wife, and she accidentally dropped it on the floor.  It was so tiny, we never did find it.  Trying to see if we can find it in the vacuum.  It is tiny!",Neutral
It was beautiful and it's so tiny. I loved it all. BUT the open end is so rough and cut very sharp it actually cut into your skin. It scratches so bad it makes your eyes tear up. Now I hope no infection kicks in.,Neutral
"Interesting concept, but overpriced.",Neutral
It’s very small and light. I am using it to hang on my rear view mirror as decoration. It’s ok. Cheep enough to buy and throw away if I didn’t like it. I will be keeping it in my car because it’s just so small and light that it disappears.,Neutral
It wasn’t gold,Neutral
Lousy.. only worked a few times,Neutral
Great product just wish it had a way to hang it,Neutral
"Nice Matte but sadly chipped off my fingers on the next day. Stays nicely on my toe nails so although a little disappointed, I still like it.",Neutral
Disappointed thst us was so small.,Neutral
"I like the look but they move too much. Well, one moves and I have to adjust it. I fear it will break if I adjust too much.",Neutral
The material of the shirt is see through so he definitely will have to wear something underneath.  It also is not true to size. So if you buy it size up. The writing and picture is really nice.,Neutral
Picture was better that the real thing,Neutral
"Edited:Came in cutesy little bag.  The first time I used the reel it pulled out, never to retract again.  Waste of money and now time out of my day to drop it off to be returned.  The seller sent a replacement that works fine, so I split the difference in stars.",Neutral
Was okay Granddaughter loved it.  Just wish it were made out of a different material that was stronger.,Neutral
Great sign but the stain of the wood did not match what I’d ordered. It was too dark and you can barely see their last name. Reached out to vendor and they said sometimes stains don’t match the color sample on Amazon. ??? This item was too expensive for them not to get this right. I was definitely disappointed. Would not order again from them.,Neutral
Writing not prominent enough,Neutral
It’s a beautiful bracelet but haven’t felt any changes and it’s been over a month. We’ll see if anything changes ...,Neutral
"I liked that the set had many definitions of figurative language, but not the cost.  ""We bundled ten literary technique posters into one low-priced set.""  $60 is low?  These people don't know teachers.",Neutral
I gave to daughter for Christmas but was very disappointed when I received this and as it shows in picture middle is hinged and you would sit in on a counter it would stand up NOT MINE it came basically flat and NO HINGE so when I tried to close like what picture shows it just popped the tiny screws out so disappointed in  this,Neutral
The fragrance is very nice. Two things needed to make this a better product: 1. A powder puff and 2. A sifting top so toy don’t get too much powder at once.,Neutral
Mas pequeño de lo que esperaba. Esta muy bonito.,Neutral
"I will keep these earrings but they are teeny tiny! It is my fault for not reading the description more carefully. Please beware….they are extra small. The picture is a bit misleading, to me.",Neutral
"large enough for my face but did not fit snugly and it very thick, maybe ok for outdoor winter weather but will probably make me sweat indoors",Neutral
"I love the design. But it’s too front heavy, or not balanced properly if that makes sense. It tips forward constantly when wearing it.",Neutral
Cute! Backing is not very secure! Good thing they will only be worn a couple of times a year!!I’ll have to find something more secure!,Neutral
"First it's not nowhere near like the description dark blue shade with some brown varieties, they are chipped as shown in my pics also there's sum sticky substance on three. But you definitely get 5 stones ( I did test ) so they are stone n have a nice thickness",Neutral
"It was weird trying to figure out how to use it at first, but once I did, it was a good fit. I have worn it nonstop for over 4 months. After showering and bathing, it has become tarnished on the back, but that is from daily nonstop use for almost 5 straight months. I'd say thats pretty good for the price. My ear wasn't gross or anything when I took the earring out - the back of the earring was just tarnished.",Neutral
"I bought all 3 to give that layer look. They are cute, but They are a bit pricey and not really worth it in my opinion.",Neutral
"Very beautiful, but they tarnish. I wore them only a couple of times and then actually forgot completely as i do not accessorize much - took them out of the box after quite some time, and they had oxidized. I am not allergic but some people might be. Also, sort of expensive for something you have to wear right away or else it goes bad.",Neutral
Hard to insert into chip readers,Neutral
Pretty,Neutral
"This bracelet is really nothing special for the price. It's basically a rope bracelet with a heart charm that is cheaply plated. The letter isn't even centered on the heart, which shows how cheap it really is. I do like that the rope is polyester, so it should last a long time without fraying. If you're looking for a grab bag gift type of gift, this is ok. I wouldn't give it to someone you care about. They're going to think you're a real cheapo!",Neutral
Pretty,Neutral
Much smaller than anticipated.,Neutral
Haven't used it yet.  Changing around my room and this will be an very nice added addition.,Neutral

"If I wanted 8 mm, I would give this 5 stars. It is lovely. I just put it in & unfortunately, it's larger than the 7mm I ordered by an extra mm. I have many hoops, ranging from 6mm to 9mm. My favorite diameter is 7mm because it fits snug but not too tight like the 6mm hoops. The 9mm hoops are BIG & I only wear them to make a bolder statement. I am still comfortable wearing the 8mm because it isn't too big but just a little bold enough. I really needed a 7mm, tho. I have read the other reviews about skin irritation. Even tho none of us are actually meant to wear sterling silver 24/7 because it tarnishes & thus, causes irritation, I did see a review where they weren't allergic to silver but sensitive to cheaper metals & the metal caused a mild infection & bump on their piercing within several hours. I do not know if this was a new piecing or not as that wasn't specified by the reviewer. If your piercing is new & has not completely healed, never put in new jewelry, including sterling silver jewelry. Sterling silver will irritate new piercings that aren't fully healed, even if you *think* your new piercing is fully healed, it's best to wait at least 4 to 6 months. But again, I don't know if that was their actual issue so leave it to me to be the guinea pig. I will leave this piercing in for several hours & if it gets irritated, then you'll know this is not genuine sterling silver but cheap metal that isn't hypoallergenic. Wish me luck! (My piercing is old & completely heald throughout, btw)<br />I will update tomorrow.<br />*UPDATE*<br />It is tomorrow. I confess, I ended up taking it out only a couple hours after I left the review. Now, I don't know if I let some of these reviews get in my head but my nose piercing started to feel..... funny. Like a very slight tingling sensation. I have never had my piercing feel like that before & I admit, after seeing so many people warn that they ended up with bumps & infections & all around discomfort, I noped on out & took the ring out. I absolutely am not taking the chance of messing up my piercing. That said, and again, it could be fear & psychological, but after I took the hoop out, my nose piercing didn't tingle anymore.",Neutral
Really nice for the price and am happy with the quality!,Neutral
Nice a little flimsy need to be careful putting up,Neutral
I was expecting the material to be more like weatherproofed fabric and a little thicker and not just laminated paper but it will do. Also the blue in the picture is more rich than in person. Think it’s overpriced for what I received but I will make it work!,Neutral
"The necklace was fine until a few days after I wore it. It turned a dingy yellow. Apparently you should not get it wet. I wish it had come with care instructions. Also, I bought it thinking it was perfect for spring and summer. Well, obviously not if it turns yellow after it’s wet.",Neutral

Is so much smaller then u think or imagine<br />Is tiny not happy with it is not long enough either to look like a real necklace on a man is too short..disappointed,Neutral
"The design is great. You can see that from the product image. It's on nice paper that should be easy to frame.<br /><br />But it looks like it was cut with scissors and poorly so. That's not an issue with a frame, but it's pretty shoddy for a $30 print, and you'd see it if you used it as a poster. Further, there are scratches on the image itself.<br /><br />I love to support a custom print for the prices artists charge. But I feel some kind of way when it's so carelessly cut. I'd request a better product, but it's not worth the trouble. It's fine. But just that: fine.",Neutral
The necklace is beautiful but after a few weeks the chain on it is starting. I got the original necklace that came with it so not sure want to expect but the chain rusting? Sad I really love the,Neutral
"I really liked the look of this little necklace in the Amazon photo, and I do think it's pretty, but here's what I don't like about it  First, it's really choker length as one other viewer said and the chain is not that sturdy.  On a child's neck it would hang prettily but on me, it's a choker and not all that comfortable to wear as I'm continually pulling on it.  Next, and this is my worst complaint, the Swarofski teardrop is way too small.  It's barely visible when on the neck so wearing it is pointless.  Last, it's very difficult to put on.  The clasp is so small and dainty that it took me a long time to get it connected.  So, I will probably keep this necklace and give it to a child as a special gift, but for me it's not suitable.  If these would be issues for you, look for something bigger or ask the artist to make it longer and put on a bigger crystal so it can be seen and worn appropriately.  Just to be clear, my issues are not with the artist or workmanship; they concern the design aspects of the piece.  Just my opinion.",Neutral
Bought this for my husband for our anniversary. It's nice and he likes it but we both agree it's small,Neutral
"I loved these rings upon receipt. My husband purchased them for me as both of our sons are November babies and I wanted something dainty, but meaningful. I love the raw stones and variance that comes with it. However, they chipped after about a week of wear, which was quite disappointing since I don't wear them for cleaning or other activities that would pose risk to the stone. I still wear both daily, but wish they would've held up longer.",Neutral

If they were a mm smaller I'd be sending them back. I'd advise they add a half inch or more to make them more comfortable, or give a small / medium  / large option. My brother couldn't even get it partway on his hand and he's an average guy.",Neutral
Really cute anklet. Wore it a few days before the clasp broke and the  charm fell off. Really disappointed,Neutral

"This product stank so bad.  It is very lovely in appearance.  I don't know if the stench is typical of resin jewelry.  If it is I don't know that I can ever buy resin jewelry again.  I put a bag of charcoal in with it for a week and that seemed to remove the odor enough to wear it. But before that, the scent was just horrible.  If you plan to give this as a gift. Buy it far enough ahead of time for the odor to go away.",Neutral
Sweet but soooo tiny.,Neutral
Bracelet ran small and didn’t feel or look worth the price,Neutral
I thought the loop and stud were one piece or at a minimum that the loop was attached to the earring back. Instead they are separate pieces and you have to try to attach them once the stud is through the ear. It is very difficult and I haven’t worn them for this reason. I don’t want to go through the trouble.,Neutral
It went on easily and dried quickly.  Looked matte for a while but does develop somewhat of a shine. Started chipping after a day with normal activities.,Neutral

"As far as gold hoops go, they do the job. They are extremely lightweight so if you want to dabble into the possibilty of wearing hoops but arent sure, give them a try.<br />I definitely think these would make good earrings for little girls because they dont pull, arent distracting, and they are smaller so they wouldnt look out of place on smaller features.<br />I give them 3 stars because I had a hard time clasping them in place, since its an insert rather than a clasp.<br />So far ive worn them twice and had no skin sensativities as well.

Bought this for my little girl’s nursery and it arrived broken. One spot had a small split and another was actually splintered wood.  Contacted the seller and they said to put wood glue on it and would get a partial refund (which I don’t think I ever got).  I used wood glue and painted it but it definitely still shows.  For $70+ I’m not very happy with broken areas showing….,Neutral

"They were a little larger than I envisioned. Not the artist's fault, just my ability to judge. The colour is very nice and overall I was pleased until I put them on.

"I was so excited to receive this coffee table.... I was expecting the wood to be rustic with possible knots and imperfections as stated in the description. However, I was not prepared to see a very large, completely open knot hole on the top of the table, where I can see clear through to my carpet. Such a bummer. I will now either return the item, or attempt to fill the knot hole, but neither solution is ideal. The table is pretty, but the wood feels extremely light weight, not very durable and there is no poly to protect it. If I end up keeping it, that is yet another step I will have to take for the table to last any length of time. The company has beautiful pieces, and I wanted to buy more from them, but sadly this was not a great first impression :(<br />**UPDATE** We ended up keeping the table and adding a few coats of polyurethane. The color is now darker but at least we can use it without staining it. As it settled in our home, a the ends of two boards have slightly popped up causing an uneven surface. You can tell they tried to fix this problem as there is a hammer dent on one of the boards. All in all, I’m adding a star for the uniqueness of the table, but wish there weren’t quality issues :(",Neutral

"This artist’s minimalistic style is very, very cool.  His shipping was extremely fast, too.  However, when I took the poster to a local custom framer last year, they advised me that the image transfer onto the poster material was uneven.  They had to cut into the border at an odd angle in order to get the poster to center correctly inside the frame.  It’s in a frame now, and it’s never coming out, so I guess in hindsight it’s not that big a deal.  It looks beautiful framed up, I’ll say that.  Having said that, though, it sure would be nice if this artist put as much time and effort into the print job as he does actually creating the artwork itself.",Neutral

I don’t want to discourage future shoppers but the pic on Amazon and what you get is very different.

The tags are beautifully scripted. The problem is they are made of such a soft wood that they break very easily. The vendor was very nice and replaced the one that came broken.

I would suggest to make them a bit heavier even if the cost was slightly higher.,Neutral

"To start out, I got this kit as a way to have a little break and relax as I wasn't able to celebrate with family over the holidays. While this was relaxing overall, there were several issues that I would think about before purchasing.Here are my thoughts:<br />Presentation: This comes in a much smaller box than I thought. While all of the items I would say were full or travel sized everything was fit very tightly together/you couldn't immediately see everything in the box before you unpacked it. There was a bit of packing stuff but it didn't do much to lessen the overcrowded box effect.<br /><br />Candle: This candle is 4 oz and will likely have about a 15-20 hour burn time. It had a nice clean burn and the wax melted evenly around the candle. It has a very light scent and I had to be very close to the candle to smell it.<br /><br />Bath salt: comes in a vial with crushed rose petals and large salt crystals and will probably last one to two baths. I have dry skin and found this overall to be very soothing. The only issue was that while most of the salt dissolved easily within 1-2 minutes there was a bit of a sand at the bottom of my bathtub after everything dissolved. It had a nice clean vaguely rose scented smell. I would have appreciated a little more fragrance but appreciate that it wasn't overdone to the point I would come out smelling like a funeral home. The crushed rose bits also made for extra hassle during clean up.<br /><br />Eye Mask:I was impressed with this, the satin was softer than others I have received in kits and wasn't overly tight as to press too firmly on my eyes.<br /><br />Body Butter: This is perhaps the item I am most confused by. It is a very thick, rich formula but when I went to apply it, it stung a bit. I have very dry skin during the cold months so this has happen before with lotions but is generally not a problem with body butter. It was a mild irritation that seemed to go away after a few minutes but was still offputting so I only used it on my legs. It also has a pretty funky smell coming out of the container that is hard to place. After a few minutes, as it soaked into my skin it evened out and smelled like a bit more like sandalwood.<br /><br />Bath bomb: It's vanilla coconut scented while the rest of the kit is some variation on rose. As a result, I have not used it yet.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay gift set and did have some positives but the scents and formulations would keep me from fully recommending it in the future.",Neutral
Bought this for a christmas ornament exchange,Neutral
"I guess I wasn’t reading carefully enough before I clicked “purchase”. This is just a printed piece of paper. The pictures are a bit misleading, so don’t use them as a guide for what you’re getting. I was hoping this would at least be heavy cardstock, but it really isn’t. It’s not even as heavy as a poster, so you will likely be as underwhelmed as I was… if you don’t read closely too. Thankfully I checked it out before giving it as a gift. I’ll purchase a frame first, and then gift it. The frame will likely be cheaper than the print, so the value for the money isn’t there.",Neutral
"Slime smelled like an overly sweet pastry candle. So strong that I cannot open the container without feeling nauseated from how overpowering it is. Did not smell like pumkin spice much, at all. The slime was very sticky even after being mixed. No activator was sent along with it, so I'm not sure if it's due to lack of experience on the seller's part or not. I've ordered many slimes and they've all come with activator and care instructions (even if all I ordered was a sample size). The packaging was cute and the texture of the slime wasn't bad, outside of the stickiness. If you don't like sweet, sugar cookie smelling candles, I recommend trying a different scented one. Did not look as pictured, either. I wouldn't buy it again, but others may really like it. When it comes to slime, it's all about preference.",Neutral
WISH THEY WERE BIGGER,Neutral
"It was only about enough for four (properly) filled Bridesmaid boxes, the color was a little disappointing. Not bad but not great.",Neutral
I thought it was framed as it was shown.  I did frame it.  Did not realize it was also printed on back which cannot be seen.,Neutral
It was a gift for my wife,Neutral
Nose wire is the deal breaker,Neutral
"Way too long of material for a head wrap. Long enough to be a long shawl. Difficult to too, too wide",Neutral
Have to be careful the chain is very very thin,Neutral
"Good quality overall but the crown could be better. Also takes a while to prepare, so plan ahead before you order.",Neutral
Small and the paint was chipped in a few spots. My sister in law and brother in law were still happy with it.,Neutral
I love hammered jewelry but was very disappointed with this ring. Looks much larger in the picture than in person.,Neutral
Is very very small,Neutral
It’s important to know that it’s not in a frame or plaque it’s a print of a “poster” it looks a little distressed around the edges. People usually don’t read the description (including myself) it’s ok though I bought a cute frame and it came out nice.,Neutral
If I saw in person I am not sure I'd buy them.,Neutral
"I liked the links.  Delivery was prompt.  However, the second day, one of the pin mounts separated from the back of the disc, needing to be remounted.",Neutral
"Very cute, but honestly the bracelet is cheaply made. I expected better quality metal. This can easily break.",Neutral
Colors were not as pictures online. Faded and almost white rather than as shown,Neutral
It was way too thin. Everytime I caught it on something it would stretch right out. Didn't expect this from Sterling Silver,Neutral
They are cute but the main picture posted is kind of deceptive.  The only reason I picked these is because I thought there was a pink border around the picture and there isn’t.  Also it says they fit an 8x10 picture frame and they do not.  I am having to trim the pictures and pray that I make them even.  Other than that great shipping time and nothing was damaged.,Neutral
Very nice. But does NOT match the size I expected pictured in the photo. Actually half the size,Neutral
Just okay.  A cardboard piece of paper with a nice printing on it.  Will need a frame!,Neutral
"This is a quality product, but it arrived with a crease in it from when it was rolled.",Neutral
I have gotten other very vibrant cards for the Lunar New Year.  This was very blah and I was very disappointed as it was for a family member,Neutral
"Let me begin by saying this is very cute and for the price you know it’s clearly costume jewelry. I got exactly what was ordered. However, within an hour of placing my order, two tops, I contacted the seller to make a change and they refused to accommodate. What made it more frustrating, my item wasn’t shipped for SEVERAL days later so I’m confused why a simple change from rose gold to gold couldn’t have been accommodated. This makes me think twice about ordering from this seller again or recommending them despite the cute necklace.",Neutral
"The product is a graphic, sandwiched between two pieces of plastic. The plastic pieces seem to just pop together. Mine popped apart as I took it out of the box for inspection.<br /><br />Otherwise it is a nice presentation, great message, unique and giftable. I popped it back together and gave it!",Neutral
"First of all, I haven't received the legs of the bench yet.  (I just now received the top, so I'm giving them some time, figuring they might be shipping separately.--But why?  Why would you ship them separately? That's so weird.)  So, this review is just for the top.<br /><br />And the top is... not what I expected.  The wood looks nothing like the picture (which I now think likely has some sort of photo filter applied to it).  It looks like cheap pine you can get from Home Depot.  The pieces seem solidly joined--so that's good.  But the finish is bad.  I can and have done a much better job finishing furniture than this.  I expect professional woodworkers to be a little more skilled than I am and to put forth a better product.  It's stained with a red-ish stain, but it doesn't even have a clear coat on it.  It certainly doesn't have a ""walnut"" finish, as the description claims.<br /><br />I'm gonna have to sand the whole thing down, restain and then seal it.<br /><br />And the cut of the wood lacks the rustic quality shown in the photos.  Like I said, it just looks like lumber from Home Depot.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much it would cost to just buy legs like these separately, but if it's less than $75 or so, I'd say I way overpaid for this.  And I got it on a significant sale.  If I had paid full price, I probably would try to return it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solid joinery<br />Nice, thick slab<br />Size is as ordered<br />The shipping on the top came significantly early<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bad finish<br />Legs missing or shipped separately<br />Not rustic--cheap-looking lumber<br />Off-gassing from finish<br />Just overall unimpressive",Neutral
"It was beautifully done....but it was just 3 cardboard with each word on it. ..no wood, just 3 cards in an envelope.<br />Shame on me if it was written and I missed that or shame on them for being deceiving in their ad.",Neutral
"These are just okay. Probably get what you pay for, but nothing impressive.",Neutral
Not the easiest to bend. hopefully i'll make it work.,Neutral
Too long.,Neutral
This specific scent is not my personal favorite. It doesn’t smell bad but if I smelled it first I wouldn’t have bought it. It does not moisturize my hair at all. It actually dries it out significantly. If you have naturally oily hair causing build up in your locs this will likely work for you. Also if you accidentally over-moisturized your locs this is good to counter that.,Neutral
I thought it would be nicer.,Neutral
"I think the label is beautiful, classy!<br />The problem I had was attaching them to the quilt.<br />The white fabric used was really good quality..so good that I had an impossible time trying to sew the label to the quilt.",Neutral
"I thought it was matted and framed due to the image associated with it. It does state clearly that it is not, but I missed that, obviously. It does not fit properly in an 8x10 frame.... I will probably never get the time or the additional funds to get it properly matted and framed, so it is probaly never going to be displayed.",Neutral
"Cute fun faux nose piercing. Looks realistic, for the price it’s fine. Happy with the product and give that a thumbs up. What I didn’t like is the way they shipped it! This is the smallest item that could have easily fit in a regular white envelope and still had room! They sent me this very small item in a huge poly bag. It was ridiculous and a waste. I’m environmentally aware and friendly, this upset me to see such waste.",Neutral
Is very very small,Neutral
Expensive for what it was. It was a cute gift though. Not sure how well it actually worked since it was a gift. I believe it did have a good smell.,Neutral
"I got this for my husband and son for Christmas. I expected a pocket knife feel. This is so light the wood doesn’t feel real -  it’s like plastic wood.  My husband tried to comb is beard, made a face, shook his head ‘no’, handed it back to me and asked where did you buy this crap the $1 store?  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT especially considering the cost!",Neutral
The smell wasn’t very strong and only lasted about a week,Neutral
Not terrible but a little smaller then I thought,Neutral
"Very nicely made however the flowers are somewhat cheap looking so I would suggest to order the jars without them & packaging consists of wadded paper vs bubble wrap so depending on the carrier handling the product, there may be a risk of damage like in my case where one of the jars arrived chipped.",Neutral
"I was very disappointed to be sent a photo after searching for metal signs. As I read it carefully, it does say it's an image. This is a fine photo but not at all what I was searching for or expecting. Read the description carefully.",Neutral
"I really like this necklace bc I wanted something simple to represent me and my son. However, I wore it once, and it’s already tarnishing. So I’m disappointed about that :(",Neutral
Photo quality is not great for the price paid.,Neutral
I thought this tag would be sparkly but it’s only a copy on paper of sparkles. It is well made but I wouldn’t have purchased it had I known it was a paper image of sparkles. Looks better in the picture than in person.,Neutral
"The hanger is super cute and was delivered quickly and packaging was great. However, the hanger is really flimsy. The wire can easily bend. It is not thick and sturdy. If I would have known how flimsy it was .. I would not have paid $30.00 for this. Very cheap looking and not high quality. Hope the bride likes it because it’s personalized, has to go to her!",Neutral
"Loved giving this to my husband for his new office, but I feel a little overpriced.  Seems like something I could have printed myself. Paid for  Convenience I suppose.  Could of justified price w frame.",Neutral
Magnet not as strong as expected<br />😐. Love the color of the stone,Neutral
I focused on the beginning of the name of this item: unframed wall art print. It says at the end of the that it is ready to frame photo. And that is exactly what it is. A photo. I guess I could have typed it up on a word document and printed it on photo paper myself. Would have saved $12.95,Neutral
Good,Neutral
Bought this for a christmas ornament exchange,Neutral
I thought this was printed on dictionary paper. It’s a photograph of an up cycled items photo paper,Neutral
"Could've sworn I'd ordered black, but red still fits my decor. Expected a brighter, shinier red for the price, but will gloss or spray paint it. That should work!",Neutral

Product was ok. Packaging was very poor.,Neutral
"I was so excited when I ordered my noodle board. The seller was responsive and designed my board with a rooster design.  When the board arrived I found that the workmanship was less than good. The handles are loose and cannot be tightened. They are loose enough that I am afraid to use them to pick the board up. It is also obvious that the seller put the handles on incorrectly and replaced them, leaving holes that he fixed with putty. That would be okay if it wasn’t so obvious. The attached pictures show the repaired holes and how they look on the board. There are also holes on the back of the board that were made when the seller put the handles in the wrong spot. They were left unfilled and it looks unfinished and cheap. The board itself is made with three pieces of wood that do not lay flat making It difficult to put anything on it. I contacted the seller to see if there this could be remedied but I got no response. I recommend you use another vendor if you want a noodle board. The quality and service are lacking here.",Neutral
"They were healthy, but definitely not 50+.  There were no more than 25.",Neutral
It wasn’t as big as I thought it would be. It’s just sitting in the corner of my porch,Neutral
They need to be bigger,Neutral
Sadly we got our order and our daughter's name was miss spelled. Also there is no real sparkle or sequence. Very disappointing. We looked to see if we could get a refund and they do not offer one. Overall the quality of the shirt is good. Just nothing like the photos advertised.,Neutral
I thought it was going to have a sticker back but it doesn’t.,Neutral
There alright. I don't think I would repurchase.,Neutral
Cute but very expensive. Also they are paper rather than a sticker like paper which isn't ideal for what I'm using them for. I put them on sanitizer bottles that will be wedding favors. If they get wet 🤷🏼‍♀️,Neutral
Not really what I expected. overpriced.,Neutral
It was pretty but the “ M” was a little awkward. Seemed a like it wasn’t done cutting,Neutral
"This item would be perfect for a clip on nose ring, but I don’t think it’s made for an actual pierced nose. Painful to insert and SUPER tiny. It’s a gorgeous piece of jewelry, though, but not good for its intended purpose.",Neutral
The gold separating beads faded almost instantly after one time use it’s a very pretty bracelet besides that,Neutral
"I got the rose gold. The color started fading after two baths. The engraving seems to have been done with a laser, the smoky patches after engraving showed on my ring. However it was okay after I cleaned it. Overall, I don’t think it’s a high quality ring if that’s what you’re looking for.",Neutral
"Just ok, kind of expensive. Could have done this myself",Neutral
"beads smaller than they appear in photo. but very well made bracelet,",Neutral
Was ok.,Neutral
I don't think its worth the money.,Neutral
Ok but smaller than anticipated and the stone is almost colorless.,Neutral
Cute but smaller than expected,Neutral
Functional,Neutral
"Beautifully crafted but so large I am unable to wear it! Break my heart, it is so much more beautiful than the picture!",Neutral
I love them they're awesome but as soon as a plant gets anywhere close to being as big as the clip it breaks,Neutral
Reminded me of getting a poster in teen magazine,Neutral
I was really expecting a whole lot! It was beautiful in other people’s pictures and thought it would look great for me. I chose the gray stain and it did not look as gray and beautiful as the one pictured on review. And the flower was bent in the box. Also the hinges weren’t on well. It would not keep the lid open and would flop down. To top it off I originally got someone else’s order with 2 weeks to spare from my wedding day! So I was highly disappointed when I finally received my order and it was a subpar ring box. The box itself was very thin and feels like it would break if you dropped it.,Neutral
Have to shove them in to fit in standard ear piercings.,Neutral
"thought it would be a little heavier, light weight aluminum seems like and the pin won't stay in",Neutral
They are pretty difficult to get off their b,Neutral
It came a bit beaten and the letters are nice and well done but very small. For my taste I would not buy it again. Now I will have to send them to fix them so that the letters stand out. It also takes longer than it says.,Neutral
The pics were fine altho' I was surprised that they were just glossy printouts.  One of the pics was double-triple print offset and blurry.,Neutral
It took a long time to receive.  It also came doused in a very strong scent. I was not able to keep it in my house as the scent was too strong. Had to return it and paid for postage.,Neutral
"I agree with the others who have reviewed, it is very small but very cute.  The description gives the size but its kind of like when my husband stretches his caught fish to measure it.  ;)  Maybe the seller could take pictures with a ruler or her hand next to the items.  Also, on the 6-inch snowman, there was a sticker that was 4x1 inch explaining the coffee dye appearance but when the sticker came off it took the dye with it, leaving a 4x1 white patch.",Neutral
This product does not clean and barely frizz. I was very disappointed. The ad should state that it is a deodorizer because it does have a nice smell but a cleaner it’s not. A waste of money and time.,Neutral
"Bought a pair about two years ago and LOVE them. Tough, durable, beautiful. Bought another pair about a year ago and the quality has gone significantly down. Bought one more pair a month ago to see how they've changed and they're still cheap. Flimsy, will break very quickly since these types of earrings require you to mold them to your ear a little. The first pair is stiff and strong. The last two pairs are thinner and cheaper than most paperclips.",Neutral
"Purchased this gift twice it was liked so much, but both had the chain break within a month. Thought the first break was a fluke and the moon with monogram was so cute. Tried again and the same thing happened.",Neutral
Too big for women.,Neutral
Pretty. A little different than pic but nice,Neutral
"The tags are the perfect weight, and the inscription is clear and easy to read. The problem is that the hole that was drilled into them is absolutely too small to fit through the attachment on most dog collars. I have yet to figure out how to get the tag on my dog’s collar.",Neutral
I like it overall but I've yet to see if it will fade plus the metal fairly thin and soft. I wanted this for a hanging sign off my lamp post but it bends easily.,Neutral
Put it on my truck & it's changing color/fading. Good for inside places.,Neutral
Very disappointed. looks so cheap.. not of good guality,Neutral
I love it how it looks on my hand,Neutral
It's a pretty keychain but... I ordered a necklace,Neutral

"I got these to help with the arthritis in my fingers, and they actually seem to be helping. They are attractive, though not gorgeous, and I like the way they look stacked on different fingers in combination with other copper rings.",Neutral
"I work in healthcare and have to wear a real medical grade mask all day every day. I bought this mask to wear when I'm not at work but have to go out somewhere. It's very well made and pretty lightweight. But to be perfectly honest I don't find it more comfortable than the medical grade mask. It also holds moisture inside, so it gets damp inside my mask, which is not an issue that I experience with the other kind.",Neutral
Looked very cheap!!!,Neutral
"Very pretty and lightweight.  I haven't got to wear them. I was frustrated that they arrived unassembled. As a older woman with less than perfect dexterity and vision, I haven't been able to secure the disc to the earring. Hopefully I find someone who can help me.",Neutral
Not as colorful as their pictures show ... ALL browns and beiges ... nice quality tho,Neutral
"This is a nice item but is deceitful. It is silver plated copper, and the band is plastic. Definitely not worth $30 like it is listed at now.",Neutral
"This was a gift for a musician buddy of mine.  He has a slender build and the bracelet did not fit his wrist at all. I make jewelry as a hobby and had the materials to extend the bracelet so that it did fit, but be warned that this item runs very small.",Neutral
"I got this for my wife and she loved it. Loved the engraving and the soft leather.<br />After wearing about a week though, she now has staining on her wrist where the clasp is. Not sure if anyone else has encountered this, but this is typically a sign of inferior craftsmanship.<br />If not for this skin staining due to the clasp, I would definitely have given a higher rating.",Neutral
Although I think it was a little overpriced it's nice. It's a nice gift for someone,Neutral
Half of the flower clip was badly tarnished and does not look like it appears on image. The clip is way bigger than it appears because the image shows the clip tucked in. I returned it and received my refund. I gave them 3 stars because they did not give me any hassle returning it.,Neutral
"Smaller than I had expected despite the measurements being posted in the description, also my order for changed from dark to light finish somehow.",Neutral
It has a good cuality print but it is to small,Neutral

A little heavy to breathe thru,Neutral
The spider web is mostly gray.  Tiny bit of web,Neutral
"This item from what I thought was like a wooden plaque or something hard to put on the wall, but it is not. It is just a piece of thick paper. To expensive for the price. Now I have to go buy a frame for it to put on the wall. Would not recommend it.",Neutral
Not the best quality smaller than expected,Neutral
"Nice print,  Too bad prints don’t come with frame. :(",Neutral
"I mean, they are what they cost. They don't hold their shape, but are about the quality you can expect for this price point. Shipped quickly, seller is great.",Neutral

"Having seasoned these new canelé molds, ( these are the ones in the left) I was surprised at the difference in color btw these and the other molds I purchased (also on amazon, all from France; others were more expensive).

I have not baked in them yet but will report back.",Neutral

Love small earrings. These are super duper small.,Neutral
"This is a beautiful pendent but it can not be removed from the chain without damaging the chain itself. I bought this as a gift for my husband, ergo the need for a tougher and thicker chain.",Neutral
I love these pictures I framed them and they look great. BUT.... the description says that there is a Stevie Ray Vaughn picture and that is complete BS because there is not. He is my favorite guitarist of all time and that’s part of the reason I bought it.,Neutral
"I got these dividers because were simple and versatile for any style. The dividers are of a thicker paper with the printed font. They do extend beyond the regular a5 paper width so you can see the tabs and are slightly bigger in general. The papers aren't of any special material or laminated, and when the product arrived it was slightly dented in a corner in a non-fixable way. I found these dividers just okay, but definitely not worth the 17.95.  I've already thrown away the wrapper so I can't return it.",Neutral
Its was bigger than I thought and I thought engraving would be darker.. Also thought chain would be longer. A.Lil sad,Neutral

The magnet is not very strong and falls off the fabric very easily. Graphic is cute though.,Neutral
"I wanted a smaller fidget, that was colorful and cute, for my daughter to use in school.  Yet, this is colorful and cute, it is to small and it doesn’t really move around much.  You can feel the rings just not fidget with it which defeats the purpose of why I bought it in the first place.  My daughter asked for another one, just larger.",Neutral
"The scent was very fragrant!! Overall it was good, but the top was not screwed all the way down and it spilled out. All in the shipping package. Is this a scent that I would get again? It’s not my personal favorite, but it is good for someone that’s likes floral scents. Again it’s very fragrant!! You won’t be disappointed!",Neutral
"I loved this bracelet, but its a heavier  bracelet than normal. It broke within a week.<br />Stones are real, and beautiful",Neutral
"Had to send it back because the strap was very thin and tore the first time it was worn. Good construction, just need to inspect the leather carefully.",Neutral
"I customized and ordered this shirt in the women's slim fit, v-neck style. The material is very good quality. The art is printed directly on the shirt, and is not a transfer. All good. Unfortunately it runs very small. I usually wear a size 12, which is a large, so that's what I ordered. The shirt was so tight, that I could use and XL or even an XXL. It would be great if Amazon vendors provided an accurate size chart for their items, especially ones you cannot return.<br />My daughter likes the shirt and wears a small or medium, so I will give it to her.",Neutral
i wouldn't of ordered it if I would of realized it was plastic.,Neutral
Really cute. Just thinner and smaller overall than I was expecting.,Neutral
Love the size,Neutral
So smallll,Neutral
Small and the paint was chipped in a few spots. My sister in law and brother in law were still happy with it.,Neutral

If you couldn’t have stamped or engraved it straight you should’ve said so.,Neutral
Pretty good quality.,Neutral
Was not real thrilled with this. It was expensive with shipping for what you receive. I knew it would be flexible I wanted it to be to use with make up but it’s really not worth it,Neutral
They are really beautiful but I got two identical ones unlike what the description says. I won't return because that will just make it more inconvenient and the necklaces are nice anyway.,Neutral
I love it other than it came bent. So I won't be able to hang it up like I wanted.,Neutral
I wish I could have seen an example or preview of how my name tag would have looked. The cursive font is very unreadable and how the lines are formatted in the back also look weird,Neutral
"Cute designs but seriously, had I known they were just little stickers printed off a printer I would have done that myself. Smaller than I thought too.",Neutral
Beautiful but price point is not worth it,Neutral
This ring is nice. I like unusual jewelry so this ring fits the bill.,Neutral
I like it but it is not worth $17-18.,Neutral
Bottom is cut off,Neutral
"Wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it is still pretty.",Neutral
"Not creamy, very dry not smooth. Not worth the money.",Neutral
"these are TINY. I knew they'd be small, but didn't realize how small. Because of their size, you can hardly read what they say. I personally think they are way too small for the price. The quality seems decent, though they do pop open and fall off my daughter's jacket. She tried putting them on her backpack, still the same, they just fall off. I've found them laying in the floor through out the house. I can't recommend these at this price point, just too small.",Neutral
"The stickers looked great but they can not be placed in anything that will attract water to them. Even if they are cold and set out and start to sweat, the label will discolor. I sat these out after being refrigerated and as they started to sweat the color faded and the labels were no longer noticeable. It was kind of embarrassing.",Neutral
"I really loved ""Sarah Cameron's"" star necklace from Outerbanks and this is exactly like that but a little too tight for my liking. I knew it was a tighter necklace and the description says choker but it is really tight for me and I don't think I will be wearing it all that often. My advise would be to measure how tight it would be around your neck and decide if you like the look or length! It is personally my preference but if you don't wear chokers a lot I would measure first!",Neutral
they were a gift for a friend but she hasn't told me that their is anything wrong with them. i thought that they were a little large but she likes them.,Neutral
"Good quality product but runs small around the hips.  I had to return mine.  The delivery was very efficient, though.",Neutral
"Fast shipping and okay product but not at all what I expected. This is the best picture that I was able to take. The background is really yellow, not white as pictured, so the name blends in with the background and is hardly visible. If they did something about the paint colors mixed with the resin it could be a better product.",Neutral
"Nice illustrations - floppy magnetic strip type material, not what I expected!",Neutral
Nice design but very small. Wish they were bigger.,Neutral
Love this book! It will be a family heirloom after all the grandmas recipes are inserted.  I would have given it more stars but the elastic string that holds the book closed wasn’t connected and too short so I had to go buy more.,Neutral
Shape of glass is rectangular not like picture. Color nice.,Neutral
"I ordered this for my brother's gf because she's a cowgirl at heart.  We go line dancing often so I knew for her birthday she'd love it.  I got a matte frame to put it in which made it look even better.  The paper itself is extremely thin so be careful and it was smaller than expected, but she loved it and that's what matters.",Neutral

Colors were not as pictures online. Faded and almost white rather than as shown,Neutral
Way too small,Neutral
"Product looks nothing like picture.<br />Expectation: Cute, small but chunky earrings that will match most anything, that will bring me better memory<br />Actual: Big and chunky dark, dark earrings that don't look appealing to wear most of the time. They're nothing at all like the pictures suggest. I knew there would be variations but the pictures aren't even close. I've cleansed, set intentions and charged them and haven't noticed any differences. I found a cure fluorite bracelet and it's making a difference so I dont think it's me.<br />Over all, I wouldn't re-order, or buy a set for someone else as a gift. The post seems glued to the crystal well, but they're just kind of really ugly",Neutral
"These earrings were less visually impressive., more cheaply made.  If you are interested in druzy earrings, check the offerings of the several other sellers on Amazon.  Thickness and the base used to support the druzy ( real or imitation) do differ from seller to seller.",Neutral
"This bracelet is really nothing special for the price. It's basically a rope bracelet with a heart charm that is cheaply plated. The letter isn't even centered on the heart, which shows how cheap it really is. I do like that the rope is polyester, so it should last a long time without fraying. If you're looking for a grab bag gift type of gift, this is ok. I wouldn't give it to someone you care about. They're going to think you're a real cheapo!",Neutral
"There's not as many beads as advertised and the watermelon charms are very small compared to the image, but the scent is good.",Neutral
"The ring is pretty but I didn't know till I received it that you can't get it wet or get lotion on it because THE GOLD COLOR WILL COME OFF!  Had I known that, I never would have bought it.",Neutral
"We loved this customized photo frame for a photo booth for our wedding day. The only unexpected thing was this was poster paper, like the kind of paper you might see a movie or band photo on, tacked on a teenager’s wall. We had to buy a poster board from a box store and find a way to adhere it and cut out the center in order for this to work as a photo frame. If we had known this, we might have purchased something different for ease of assembly.",Neutral
"This is simply a single necklace. Since it's called a best friend necklace and you get to choose the initials, I thought I would be receiving 3 separate necklaces. Sadly, I received one necklace, one pine-cone and the 3 initials I specified.  The  necklace is beautiful. Just know that you are only getting one.",Neutral
The rose gold wore off in about 2 days after wearing it. Don’t get me wrong it is beautiful. But the fact that the color wore off that fast was really disappointing.,Neutral
It does not run big as previously stated from another review. All my jewelry is size 7 and this ring fits snug and uncomfortable. It is much simpler in comparison to the pictures privided.,Neutral
"Its a good tumbler but very fragile, not the best quality in material. You can buy a better/sturdier wine tumbler for less. Maybe worth 14.99 for the custom engraving of the elephant.",Neutral
"I really like this necklace, but when I got it, it was a little bent, and even has a little scratch on it.  I was able to bend it so that the mountains were straight in the circle, but the scratch is there to stay.  I wish it was a little nicer quality, but it will be appreciated by the person receiving it anyways.  I don't think I would buy this again.  I might pay a little more for something a little more sturdy and better quality.",Neutral
Very flimsy,Neutral
"Ordered this for my 12 year old because he likes to fidget... He loved it! However, within the first half hour the chain part of the necklace had already broken while he was wearing it. I can easily fix it myself, so won't return it, but it was a bummer and I'm worried that it will break again easily.  Love the look of it and it meets his fidget needs, but the cord/chain could be a better quality.",Neutral
"This is definitely *not* engraved. Honestly, I'm concerned how the print and overall color will wear. Maybe not the best choice for a man that's hard on his wallet.",Neutral
This arrived bent and the print quality was subpar. It looked cheap and faded. There is no way to get another sent by my anniversary. 😖<br /><br />They contacted me and fixed the issue,Neutral
"This is gorgeous, but NOT a low profile, everyday, sort of wearable ring! It's LARGE, and sits up HIGH & bulky! That said, it is a STUNNING ring! Now, I gotta find an occasion in this podunk, hillbilly town, to wear it in...",Neutral
"This arrived and it was printed really close, maybe a centimeter or two, from the top, so it will look weird in a frame. It is also creased at the top where it didn't quite fit onto the cardboard it's against in the packaging.<br /><br />I usually don't order anything that is not Prime because I really like to have free returns, but I paid shipping for this because I thought it would be so cool in my children's room.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed.",Neutral
"I purchased this necklace based on the image pictured. I'm disappointed. It's very yellow not a nice gold like the picture. Looks kinda cheap in person. I have only had it for about 2 weeks and it has already broken 3 times. Just falls off my neck and a link is broken each time. Luckily I have been able to repair it but for the price, this shouldn't happen, also was expecting the color that is pictured. I have to say though that I had to contact the seller about a shipping question and they were excellent at communication in that respect.",Neutral
The crochet to attach to oven handle is a nice fit but the towels are not as thick as I would like them to be.,Neutral
The bracelet is beautiful and feels nice on the wrist when first put it on.  The problem is that it constantly needs to be tightened.,Neutral
Scent could be stronger,Neutral
"I like the chain and the lion charm, but its too small.....I cant read the message on the little lion.<br />Next time I will order bigger.",Neutral
Not a poster. Only 10 by 12 photo on photo paper.,Neutral
I bought this as a gift for a man’s hand and when it arrived I was kind of disappointed at the size it looked like something for a baby!<br />Or maybe a girls hand not a man’s. But it was made well it was pretty just the whole thing the stones the bead was too small.,Neutral
"I bought this for our granddaughter who is cheer crazy, we liked the cost and understand you get what you pay for regarding $40 vs others at $100. The issue is when my son received it being in the graphics business he noticed an issue with the vinyl decal. Whoever placed the decal on must of lifted the decal off again before pressing it down creating the ripples / scratch etc. If you look at the photo you will see 2 areas above the M & below the A. It figures I sent this item to someone who  does vinyl & screen printing for a living lol. (Yes I could've just had him make a bag, I was trying to surprise her)",Neutral
"It is pretty, but the clasp is so small that I can’t clasp it alone",Neutral
"Product came customized quickly as described. If you are using it indoors or for 1 day you should be happy, though name could be larger, if you are planning to post it outside for a 3+ days sign fades and runs pretty quickly.",Neutral
Didnt come framed as pictured,Neutral
I love the design! I have mixed review on this at the moment. I initially bought this for my nose piercing which is so funny because it doesn’t even go in my nose. It’s so small in length and thin when you try to put it on. you need to be careful with it. The good thing it says it can be used for other ear piercings which I am getting in the future. I’m not sure it will fit but will just have to see.,Neutral
It's a gift you give someone for their 80th birthday as it says right on the hat. Not high quality but they at least have something to wear at the party and maybe a few times after that.,Neutral
It’s a cool print but low quality,Neutral
Gift. Not as pretty as the picture,Neutral
"I guess with the title ""whipped,"" I was expecting it to be fluffier, but it's closer to bar soap.  It does lather better than a regular bar of soap.  I used it on my legs before shaving and it worked just fine.  It smells really nice, but so does the moisturizing body wash that I normally use.  I'll keep using the product until it's out, but I personally wouldn't buy it again.  My ""idea' of what the product would be like based on the picture just doesn't match what it's really like.",Neutral
Good!,Neutral
I really thought the picture was going to be bigger,Neutral
"My boyfriend loved the ring, fit great, but not to happy with the dull green color we got.",Neutral
It is very pretty. Buy to pricey .,Neutral
It is done nicely however the magnet was not strong enough to hold it on the door to our state room.  We bought other magnets that stayed much better on the door but they were not as nice as this would have been.,Neutral
Cute photo for bathroom or something. I wasn’t expecting it to come on regular photo paper. I figured it would have come on canvas,Neutral
"Looks acrylic and it is nice, but not the most beautiful ornament.",Neutral
Did not meet my expectations,Neutral
"Based on the picture, you'd think it was a normal sized item about the size of a quarter, but when received I was surprised at how small the pendant and how fine the cord is.  The pendant is a hair smaller than a dime.  The cord is thin - will not likely last more than a few months.",Neutral
The red sticks arrived bent in multiple places and now won't stand up straight.,Neutral
Nice quality. The moon/star a lot smaller when worn.,Neutral
This was a gift and it looks pretty!,Neutral
Pretty but smaller than anticipated.  It'd be nice to show on an ear in the product pics.,Neutral
"Leaks water that catches on the ledge in the back, pollen molded.  Pieces came apart when I tried to clean it out by running water in it.  I am sure I can glue them together and caulk the back, should have been done prior to sending out.",Neutral
Very well made and possibly for one pig this would be a wonderful idea but with multiple pigs u have to change this every other day if not daily.,Neutral
Is Ok<br />had to iron it several time to make it  folded<br />n,Neutral
Was expecting larger,Neutral
Just okay.,Neutral
This hand towel is very thin and to me not worth $9.99.,Neutral
Size,Neutral
"This is a tiny bracelet for babies. It is very small and you can hardly read the engraved name on the bracelet. It is not expensive,. I guess  you are getting what you pay for. I returned the one I bought. The seller took it back but I had to pay the postage.<br />I guess it pays to spend more and get a better bracelet.",Neutral
"Very nice looking necklace but not a piece to be worn everyday. After wearing for several weeks, peas lose their shine and become chaulky looking. Loved the necklace but disappointed in the fade of shine.",Neutral
Comes rolled up with lots of creases... how do  I make it flat without ruining it ???,Neutral
Looks cheap,Neutral
Disappointed in the size and i guess i didnt read where it said it was paper.,Neutral
About a half size too small. Tried to make stacking rings in photo.,Neutral
Had to turn L shape since it showed and messed it up a bit.,Neutral
"I loved everything about these ear rings till I had a reaction to them. I have never had a problem with any ear rings and I questioned if I become sensitive to any metals. I can wear all my ear rings without a reaction, this one sadly I can’t.<br />Be careful if you have sensitive ears with these.<br />The only reason I gave it a 3 out of 5.",Neutral
Product looked nice but had no room variations with the sizes of the chain. Product was meant to fit a 3.5mm chain but simply could not.,Neutral
I'm disappointed with the overall quality of the final outcome. The little circle is off centered and does not cover the whole side that it is meant to cover. It is a basic measuring tape that they got from home depot or lowes and they glued a thin wooden circle to the side of it. The engraving looks fine. No issues there but I'm still wishing that they picked a better size circle of wood or at least centered it better. This is meant to be a gift... and it is barely giftable with the poor attention to detail here. And there's some type of dried glue that didn't get clean up and now it's dried on there unable to take off... was excited for the concept. And I might be nit picking.... but I expected better quality. I guess the measuring tape itself works fine. 3 out of 5. marked down one star for placement of wood and another for the wood glue.,Neutral
"Look as shown. Didn’t hold nearly as well as other brands I have used, though.",Neutral
Bag slot needs to be smaller to make it tighter and easier to rip. Other than that it is super cute,Neutral
Not soft! It is made of acrylic yarn. Otherwise fits as expected and good quality.,Neutral
Birthday for granddaughter bracelet is discolored already and turning black:(,Neutral
I liked it,Neutral
Product came damaged with a hole in it.  Cute socks.,Neutral
"This was a lot smaller than I imagined and is only really a blue lace agate bead wrapped, rather than shaped stone.",Neutral
Price point and over packaging make it 3 stars,Neutral
Too small for my nose which is a little bigger but good quality,Neutral
The picture makes these earrings look like real slices of grilled cheese sandwiches. The earrings I received look very fake and cheap. Especially considering the high price. Bummer!,Neutral
"This watch band is beautiful and seems to be well-made, however, if you like to wear your Apple Watch snuggly on your wrist, this is not the band for you. I am unable to wear the band because I cannot get it tight enough to stay snuggly on my wrist for the sake of haptic notifications, etc. Really beautiful, it just doesn't work for me.",Neutral
"I received almost half jar, it's not fair. I don't know yet if the product is good or not.",Neutral
I did not receive all of my stakes.<br />Otherwise they work great.,Neutral
I gave it a 3 because the words are fading out.,Neutral
"Much thinner than I expected for a keychain.  I was expecting one at least twice as thick as the one received.  The stamping was nice, overall a decent product, I would probably not order again due to the thickness",Neutral
I should've read reviews... It does NOT include the frame.  The idea is so cute and the product is good. I just wish I'd read more.,Neutral
"My name is wrong, it should have been<br />S  Hahar’s",Neutral
This is a Christmas gift for my daughter it is nice but I would have made the beads larger. Hopping she likes it .,Neutral
Very pretty and looks just like the photo however the backs don’t stay on for me I have to use backs that did not come standard with these.,Neutral
"The nose part being bendable is cool. Other than that, they were too thick and klunky for me.",Neutral
It is well made.  But I can’t get the smell out.<br />I’m afraid if I put it in my purse the whole purse will smell. I think I will return it and try a different one.  It’s that dirty socks / basement smell.,Neutral
It's okay thought the gold letter would be bigger.,Neutral
"I really like the burlap mat, it’s really thin and not very Sturdy it could be thicker",Neutral
"Update...after spending more time applying and using a blow dryer to help, I think I got them on half way decent. Time will tell how they look after we visit DW in Jan.<br /><br />Not a fan of these skins, too many wrinkles and bubbles, and hard to get on straight. Would not recommend.",Neutral
Loved this! BUT it got sooooo stretched out throughout the day. It wouldn’t stay on my head. Super frustrating out there on the slopes. Not great material for this unfortunately,Neutral
Bent up !!!,Neutral
The earrings were nice but the bottom of the earrings were bent out to much and the end was very sharp. So I sent them back. I don’t know if they Were defective or if that’s the way they’re supposed to be,Neutral
Not as bright as pictured. Color was also not as nice as pictured.,Neutral
"The necklace was absolutely beautiful when I received it. Unfortunately, the necklace metal started turning green after only having it for a month. I never got it wet so I’m unsure why that happened.",Neutral
Will say it feel and fits great. i got it on time with no issues. However with in 3 weeks of have the ring the gem pop out.,Neutral
"The pillows were ok.  I was hoping for them to be more soft and the sequins to more more smoothly.  Also, the picture of the unicorn was very faint.  Probably will not purchase again.",Neutral
"Pretty, not as large as I thought it should be. Very flimsy silver. But my daughter loved it. Great etching!",Neutral
Information was OK. Was received in a timely fashion. Not really suitable for framing..it came bent and a bit flimsy.,Neutral
It’s not what I imagined but I mean it gets the job done.,Neutral
I love the color and the look. The only problem is that it burns fast and when putting it out sends so much smoke in to my room.,Neutral
Liked the design.... too fragile.,Neutral
Painted from one side only! :(,Neutral
Beautiful but not worth the price,Neutral
"Photos are misleading, the garland is actually quite small. It won’t work for what I had intended.",Neutral
I ordered 3 for my home office. I mean they're cute and all...but not for $18 a piece!,Neutral
"Necklace is perfect.  BUT, it does not have the Grandmother, mother and granddaughter message on the card.<br />I'm disappointed because without the message it's just another necklace.<br />I sent a message asking if it is possible to get the cards with the message on them and they didn't bother to respond.",Neutral
ok,Neutral
"Ordered a medium it fell a little short for me just about my waist, i am 5’10, if you like longer tees I wouldn’t recommend.",Neutral
The word Venezuela is very small,Neutral
"Very personalized and perfect gift. However, it doesn't have glass.",Neutral
"I don’t feel like the item was worth the 35$. It is custom and was for our wedding anniversary but it’s so small and the quality is average. Plus I paid an extra 35$ to get it here in time, so a total of 70$, wouldn’t but again.",Neutral
"The look is great and goes perfect with my space but I was really disappointed with a few things, you would think if you are paying a bit more for a product it should be made right, the end piece of the wood was super loose and fell off while putting it on wall, also one of the hooks was bent in.",Neutral
"It's cute, but I wanted to use it in my classroom as a motivational poster.  The guide word at the top is &#34;hanky panky&#34;, so I don't think it is the best idea in a 5th grade classroom. Wish I would've seen that detail before I ordered.",Neutral
It’s pretty but smaller than expected—can’t use it so it will have to become a gift,Neutral
Ok,Neutral
"I bought this for a baby shower cake. It was super cute but it fell apart. Sadly, that was $30 down the drain 😢",Neutral
"While the hippo itself is beautiful and well crafted, the chain itself feels cheap and the actual latch to connect the chain to itself is small and fustrating to deal with given the slot is barely a fingernail's depth.",Neutral
It’s cute enough but pretty plain. Not very special.,Neutral
The poster was ok but I paid for it to have my son’s picture on it and it was not. So what was the point in me sending a picture and it wasn’t on the poster.,Neutral
"Really cute, the tops are nice but the posts are soft/flexible. I bought these about 4 months ago and 2 posts have broken off from 2 of the sets.. they are good for my daughter's sensitive ears, just wish they were stronger.",Neutral
I don’t know what to say. Nothing wrong with it but the birds that come to my yard ignore it. I can’t see that any of it was ever used. I’m not sure why.,Neutral
Muy pequeños más de lo que esperaba,Neutral
Definitely cheap<br /> Got it to say my new Borns first name and middle name cute but very flimsy and know it'll get cought break since it opens up on everything,Neutral
"Has a soft texture. Very nice feeling, but does not smell like sweet pea essential oil. Not even close.",Neutral
"I really like the consistency of the body butter and it is very moisture rich. My only issue was the apple caramel scent was really, really, really strong. It smelled like a glade plug-in. I would have loved it if the scent was a bit lighter. I will try other scents.",Neutral
It was an irregular T-shirt. I was not happy about that so I didn't wear it on my birthday.,Neutral
I absolutely LOVE the look of this watch band and have zero complaints about its beauty or appearance. However I can only give it 3 Stars since it fails to fully function as an Apple Watch band should. This band cannot keep a tight fit against your wrist and as a result your health data isn’t computed properly because your watch is not understood to be “on your wrist”. I REALLY wanted this to be functional for everyday use but unfortunately it will only be used for special occasions. i am DEFINITELY keeping it because it’s so gorgeous and I LOVE IT!!! Just wished it could be improved to clasp tighter on first wrap.,Neutral
"Comes in a great pack, engraving not very visible , gif-table, tiny and looks very elegant",Neutral
I bought two bracelets. I lost one at the park because of the clasp and the second class on the second bracelet also opened and I lost it in a store and don't know where. I wish that the closure very much more solid.  Maybe a lobster claw and be good.,Neutral
"The plaque is attractive and the saying is catchy, but overall it's really not worth the money.  I didn't read the description well enough or I wouldn't have bought it because it has vinyl lettering rather than carved.  Painted on lettering would have given this plaque a higher-end appearance.<br /><br />Since it's meant for outdoors, I really don't see how it's going to last. The vinyl letters don't appear to have had a sealant sprayed over them and the plaque is very thin.  This is NOT a sign meant for an exposed area...definitely needs to be on a covered porch with protection from moisture.<br /><br />Those who are crafty could simply buy a black plaque from the craft store with 40-50% off coupon, press-on letters from the dollar store, and make it for far less.",Neutral
"Takes up a lot of room and if you’re tall like me, you’re going to bang your knee and eliminate the “middle seat” on a Honda Pioneer.",Neutral
"It's very pretty but a little snug, but I should have requested a little larger size, hopefully it will stretch just a bit over time. Otherwise I'm pretty happy with it.",Neutral
Card slots are a bit tight,Neutral
I love the pendant with the birthstone.  The chain was good for the price I paid.  It looked good it just irritates my neck. The only real problem I have is the birthstone  won’t always stay on the front.,Neutral
I had issues getting the sticker to stay in certain spots. Not excited about that.,Neutral
It's small but it's cute.,Neutral
"Absolutely beautiful necklace! Very well made. I love it. My only problem is the clasp. It slides through the ring and gets stuck so that the necklace can't move and has to be freed from the chain, only to get stuck again. I'll have to figure out a way to fix or replace it, so that I can actually wear the necklace properly again. Other than that, totally wonderful piece that I am very happy to have.",Neutral
Well certainly didn't work for my eggs. I used it to then stamp labels and put on egg cartons.,Neutral
"The product smells nice, but the color of the liquid is not as advertised. It is a yellowish green, not a clear to blush pink color.",Neutral
Small but very nice for my son's space theme room. Comes unframed. I just used dbl sided tape and stuck it to the wall. A little pricey for something so small that I prob couldve downloaded and printed myself off Pinterest or etsy,Neutral
"I like the wooden name a lot. But, it had flaws. First, i had to sand the edges of the name because the edges weren’t smooth & pieces of wood were sticking out. (like wood tearout)<br />Second, I paid extra for it to be painted white. It was painted nicely besides the back of the dot that goes on the “i”. It was dirty & not painted. I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good. Just disappointing when you pay that much money & the product has these issues with it that i had to take the time to fix / edit to make it right.",Neutral
Its very beautiful and well done but very heavy.  Owner of shop worked with me and I was able to return it.  If you have a job where you have to dress up this would make a great piece!,Neutral
They have a nice idea but it wasn’t that craftsmanship that I expected with the interior glass. From the photos I saw It looked more authentic. Maybe a deeper color.,Neutral
It serves its use It's okay,Neutral
"Items is very nice and easy to use, just when I received them. They was broke, the y on family on all 3 was broke. I had to glue them together.",Neutral
"The item is exactly as pictured.  However, the quality isn't great, so I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.  I probably could have taken some spare wallpaper and done the same and it would come out similarly.  Well, next time...",Neutral
The colors are far from being as vivid as on the photo.<br />Overall quality is ok. All in all it is overpriced and I would not buy again.,Neutral
"I wish I could share a photo, but I purchased this item for my sister, with her two daughters and her names Engraved!  It’s still a beautiful necklace, but extremely too, too small! I shop online slot, I consider myself a professional online shopper, and anytime I buy jewelry I want get it if I can’t see a picture of the item on a real person! If the item is on a person that’s when you can truly see the size of the item, before purchasing! The print is soooo tiny, you need a magnifying glass to see names, and that was DISAPPOINTING!",Neutral
The material felt like it should have been on a table... I paid for express shipping it got here almost a week later... and a color was added to the name that I didn’t ask for or that doesn’t match...,Neutral
Over priced and very small. I thought for thebpricr I may be getting something a lot bigger. That may have been my fault for not estimating the size properly. But after I recieved it I say similar mirrors at the local stores for a fraction of the price.,Neutral
Looks nice I just thought it would be a bit heavier. It's extremely lightweight.,Neutral
"Feels like it's self-adhesive &#34;label&#34; made.  The kind that you can press on and peel off.  I can feel the roughness of the art over the dulled looking hard plastic cover top ( we were just looking for; (1) the hard plastic to be a little clearer and (2) made with better quality materials).  Sadly enough, but, sooner or later the beautiful art will eventually lift and peel off.  We're expecting sooner than later.",Neutral
Super small,Neutral
"This is not a one-of-a-Kind print like others I have purchased. This is cute, but it is a scan of an original, then printed on FujiCrystalArchive photo paper. It doesn’t have the look of the original dictionary paper and a block print or screen print. Ok for price point, now I know why this was basically the two-for-one pricing.",Neutral
I wouldn't say the quality is the best,Neutral
"ok,very small",Neutral
"I was very excited to get this suncatcher. However, I'm not impressed. It's cute but doesn't sparkle in the sun as I expected it to. Definitely not worth the price I paid.",Neutral
It wasn’t “ gift worthy” .. very cheap looking,Neutral
It didnt come as advertised the I'am a grandma again was not on the back so i had to fix it. And the blocks dont have a nine. But other then that turned out ok.,Neutral
Adorable but tiny. Kind of expensive for what I got.,Neutral
"The smell of the Palo Santo was really nice when it first arrived, of course after some time it does lose a bit everyday though. The packaging was nice and the letter that came with it as well.<br />My main complaint is the metal piece, it has been turning my skin into green without water touching it, no sweat either. I'm very careful not to ruin jewelry especially wooden ones.. if Creator had used Stainless Steel, this wouldn't be an issue. I did buy this and another a gift but wouldn't do it again..",Neutral
The pendant is beautiful but the only time I wore it my neck rusted. That was after a few hours so now I only hang it above my altar,Neutral
"It was mostly comfortable, breathable, and warm.  It just irritated the tip of my nose which is neither big nor small, with an impossible to ignore tickle.  It may be perfect for others' noses.  Other than that, the craftsmanship and color were lovely.",Neutral
"I thought that price was for a set of four.  My fault, I should have been more careful.  So many people/companies trying to take advantage of the consumer with trickery and misrepresentation.  It did say one (next to the photo of 4).  Consumer beware",Neutral
Bought them for boyfriend but I’ll be the one wearing them. They are small. I wish they had option for sizes.,Neutral
I have placed it on my dresser but have yet to see any miracles or energy radiating from it.  Ha Ha Ha.!  I can only hope it effects my energy level soon.,Neutral
It wasn’t gold,Neutral
Very cute print and I love it for that but you need to iron it to keep it in place.,Neutral
Very cute Hanger however the wiring is very flimsy and non sturdy. You can definitely bend the wires to spell another word lol<br /><br />Probably won’t purchase again but will still give as a gift! I just don’t think it will last more than 5 days with the wire.,Neutral
"Cute, like the look but black in writing is worn off after 4 weeks.",Neutral
I love the design of it but the quality isn’t there it’s just stuck on with some sub par adhesive and will not last long at all,Neutral
This is very nice but disappointed that it didn't include dog breed at the bottom as shown.,Neutral
"I did not expect anything spectacular with the price - but $14 is too much to pay for a photograph of a wooden sign.  It would probably look ok framed with a matte.  But I do not want a photo of a wooden sign in a frame.  I gave it 3 stars rather than 1 simply because the print was good quality.  So disappointed with this.  I admit I did not read about it in detail, because I was in a hurry.  But I never would have even considered it was a photo based on the price!",Neutral
"I love the concept of this air tag holder for a wallet to keep the air tag in place.  Unfortunately it is too thick.  I can’t for it in my wallet.  It’s sturdy, and I can see using this in a purse or bag, but not a wallet",Neutral
"This fragrance oil smell very close to the original perfume, but doesn't last as long as the original perfume on me, despite it is a fragrance oil. I will use it to make candle instead of using as perfume. Lovely scent.",Neutral
I used for my certificate of accomplishment.  The turquoise color is not very true or very deep.  The picture of the color was misleading.  Nice frame though.,Neutral
"Reggy Wever, te gustaría ser mi padrino?",Neutral
"Very cute, stitching came undone after not much use.",Neutral
These are so soft you can bend them just putting them in,Neutral
"The pillows were ok.  I was hoping for them to be more soft and the sequins to more more smoothly.  Also, the picture of the unicorn was very faint.  Probably will not purchase again.",Neutral
"After while some of gold coming off, but to be expected for fake",Neutral
Pages are tiny and there's not much room to write anything much. About as useful as a post it note.,Neutral
"Ordered this for my 12 year old because he likes to fidget... He loved it! However, within the first half hour the chain part of the necklace had already broken while he was wearing it. I can easily fix it myself, so won't return it, but it was a bummer and I'm worried that it will break again easily.  Love the look of it and it meets his fidget needs, but the cord/chain could be a better quality.",Neutral
This fragrance was a bit strong for me but love their Christmas tree fragrance!’n,Neutral
Part of the aninal is cut off on the edges of every pic. Have to use a frame or looks funny.,Neutral
The W is crooked and the finish looks off,Neutral
it’s a wee bit to small to be perfect for my likes,Neutral
"The quality is excellent, but I can't rate higher because it's not an efficient way to get bases.<br />I was trying to order multiple bases, which the picture had me believing and the title said ""bases"" indicating plural. The price is fair for one base, but I would rather buy 4 and pay to ship together rather than paying as much for shipping as I did for the base itself.",Neutral
Bad box,Neutral
"I really like that the weekly starts on a Sunday, that was the whole reason I bought it and it fits in my happy planner perfectly. I gave 3 stars because my highlighters and even pen ink bleeds through the pages pretty bad, I probably won’t repurchase for that reason.",Neutral
Its like they are copied on the cheapest paper. After them costing so much they difinatly need framed,Neutral
I wish I could have had a preview of the initials. I got TLZ for my son. The Z looks more like a 2 than a z. I'm dissappointed in the appearance. The concept is really neat. He loves to fish. It's a christmas present so we'll see what he thinks.,Neutral
"They came in great but I mean for what you get, you could have printed this yourself at home with a good quality photo paper. Maybe they could consider lowering the price or making it a canvas print.",Neutral
"As with any custom order, sizes vary.  In this case, however, the sizes of the 6.5 bracelet varied from 6.25&#34; to 7.5&#34;.  These were purchased for my partner who has a 6&#34; wrist.  She liked them, I just wish sizing was more accurate.  In the case of these, make sure you realize the measurement is from clasp to clasp. and variable.",Neutral
"Lovely product,smoothes under eye,unfortunately does not take away the dark circles",Neutral
"It’s very cute, and does it’s job, but for materials used it is extremely overpriced. I feel like now that I have seen it in person it could easily be made yourself if you watch a video. Learn from my mistake and save yourself the money.",Neutral
"Poor quality cuff links, the black part feels plastic and not onyx. The initials are printed, white and not nicely contrasting with the silver buttons. The closing mechanism is cheap, not even minimal resistance to hold its position. Not going to wear it,  Disappointed.<br />Good service though, responsive seller, arrived on time",Neutral
The keychain was well made but the name that I personalized it with was much smaller than anticipated.,Neutral
"I thought the print came with  a frame.  So, I  was disappointed when I  received only the print.",Neutral
"The “turquoise” is not genuine. I have many pieces of the real thing, this is not.",Neutral
Very fun and soft looking. Looks impressive however it doesn't seem to hold the powder that well.  I'm not thrilled with it but will continue to use it until I can find something that may suit my needs better.,Neutral
"For the price, I expected a better quality. Dainty is another word for small, which is fine, but also the connected chain is a disappointment",Neutral
"My son LOVES this toy, but after ONE day of very gentle use (hugging, not throwing or tearing) the side seam popped and he pulled out its stuffing. The stitching should be a lot firmer for children’s use. I was able to re-sew it, but it doesn’t look as nice now. The materials are nice and soft and it is overall perfect, but I was very disappointed in the seam.",Neutral
It was a cute little puzzle but I ordered the maid of honor one & I got the bridesmaid one & obviously I didn’t see it until she put it together.,Neutral
Loved the mask design and flamingo pattern. Liked mask was made in the USA  Did not like the nose piece constantly coming out of the hole. And the mask is hot. Needs to be lighter material.,Neutral
"It’s nice. But it’s NOT the strip. Statue of Liberty in between Strat and Paris? Nope.<br /><br />I like it, but I think those who love Vegas might want more accuracy.",Neutral
"I initially used this product for knee pain... It was great the first time I ordered it. It was smooth and it just rolled on my knees without any problems. The second time I purchased it, it was pretty grainy and kind of dried up... it was a little disappointing to say the least.",Neutral
"Product container cracked in shipping. Overall it was a good slime, but there was more pink than blue so the slime ended up turning light pink. The scent made the slime cloudy.",Neutral

"I searched Patuchouli soap because I wanted it for a gift for a friend. When it came soap looked fine, but the aroma was pretty non existetent. So therefore it is sitting on my kitchen counter and another gift was purchased.",Neutral
Love the look of two hoops but it was flimsy. I wiped my face with a towel after a shower and it caught and stretched it out and now it’s ruined. I also got the 8mm and it stuck out further from my nostril than I like. I like them snug so I might try the 6mm,Neutral
Love these! Hilarious! But they do make my ears hurt after a few hours. Holes swell a little and are painful for about 24 hrs after wear.,Neutral
Pretty but came tarnished and I was unable to gift so I returned it.,Neutral
Looks better in the picture than in person.,Neutral
Daughter thought it was a cheesecloth which makes me think it had to be thin.  Overall she thought it was funny and cute.,Neutral
For the price thought the mirror would be bigger. The stain was different than the color picked.,Neutral
Thought it was a full nylon bottom with a mailbag flap. Nothing more than a mesh bag with a small zip pouch and strap. Was kinda disappointed.,Neutral
It is pretty and just like picture but bends too easily. I returned it,Neutral
"I get a lot of compliments on it but it is a little bulky and heavy (even tho it’s made of felt). The alligator clip has a tendency to spin so the little book is often off kilter, sideways or upside down while wearing it. I do like it and think it’s cute, though.",Neutral
"I bought solid wood framed map in large siz to display in medical clinic patient waiting room. The frame was apparently handled while stain or finish was still tacky because it is covered with prints in the finish. In addition, the foam board id thin so that the push pins go all the way through. If you should purchase this, be awarre that it will possibly NOT be the quality workmanship, and that the manufacturer argues that the item is perfection and does not stand behind the product. We would have, at the very least, expected an offer of a sheet of foam board to spray glue tto back and stain to touch up the many fingerprints or rubber  glove prints, as the seller claims. All we received was an argument defending the seller’s educational credentials.<br /><br />Follow up.  Debbie after several phone calls, replaced the defective frame.  Although the inital order was not done to my satisfaction, the problem was fixed.",Neutral
Complete junk  dont waste your money it is too thin of plastic it wont last at all or you will burn yourself with hot coffee. It is way too thin. Once again looks good in licture until<br />It arrives. Very didappointed,Neutral
"I like the idea of the ring. The stone sticks really far out off your hand so be careful with hitting it on everything throughout the day. Mine was just poorly made, although I'm sure that isnt the case with them all I can see them being very popular. It would be cool to be able to choose your stones because I wouldn't mind mine and my husbands stone instead of my birthstone and a cz. Maybe secure the pins that hold the ring on better. Mine could have just fallen out but I didnt wear it after I noticed that within the first hour of having it. Great ring though.",Neutral
The product looked like I needed it too and would have been perfect for a late Mother’s Day gift for my mom…however there is a whole in the product. Very disappointed about this seeing how it was already a day late being delivered.,Neutral
nice but you can buy it cheaper then I did,Neutral
Much smaller than expected.,Neutral
The length of the necklace listed is 1”. I didn’t realize that included the loop for the chain so the stone is smaller than I expected.,Neutral
I got compliments on the pendant but the chain was turning on me. I thought stainless steel wasn’t  supposed to turn,Neutral
A lot smaller than you think but still nice,Neutral
"Happy with the product overall, however it was not delivered as pictured.  The print I received was landscape layout.  Chose to keep and work around the layout issue.",Neutral
Product looked nice but had no room variations with the sizes of the chain. Product was meant to fit a 3.5mm chain but simply could not.,Neutral
It is a cute pic...for the price I would have thought the paper would be better quality.  Seems like it was on a home printer...but looks fine in the frame.,Neutral
I absolutely love the idea of the necklace the colors are not as vibrant I was a little disappointed,Neutral
These were great at first but they began to tarnish very quickly and it became a hassle to have to clean them everyday.,Neutral
I really wanted to give this 5 stars. This blanket is so soft and super cute with my pups name. But it is too small for bigger dogs. Too bad there isn’t an option to purchase a bigger blanket.,Neutral
Not worth the money as it is dim and faded!,Neutral
Looks like what you paid for. A little larger than I expected from pictures others posted.,Neutral
It was ok. Thought a little bigger.,Neutral
Looks really cool! Biggest issue is that it looks like the etching machine left some horizontal scratches on the glass that aren’t part of the art.,Neutral
In hindsight I should have just bought the scent from bulk apothecary. Smelled fine but the alcohol it was in broke out my eczema.,Neutral
I like the bracelet but the string is coming apart and pretty soon it won't be a bracelet,Neutral
"The product does have a disclaimer for using flour dough, where the gluten causes springboard.<br /><br />Beautiful craftsmanship but much too expensive for the extra effort need to stretch out whole wheat flour dough",Neutral

Tags fell off today somewhere in my 1.5 acre yard, rings still attached to collar and tag gone.<br />It is advertised as ""NON LOST""<br /><br />I will order another tag but I will use my own ring to attach to collar.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed.",Neutral
I like this product. I am not a fan of the spout to use this product. I feel like I am wasting more than I am actually using.,Neutral
"In actuality, it is not what I thought.  The color is green while in the picture it is blue.  The ring is not smooth.",Neutral
Too pale,Neutral
"I ordered this to be part of a baby gift.  I do paper crafts myself, and wish I had taken the time to make a banner myself.  It’s cute, but the sides and backs are not finished.  They are raw cardboard.  I will use the banner, but would not order again.",Neutral
cute but VERY small,Neutral
"Photo paper prints were well packaged and arrived in great condition. The photo is in the center of an 8x10 printer photo sheet. The photo is actually really pretty. But for me I felt that the colors were not as vibrant or standout as in the amazon pic. I laminated them and that really made the colors darker and stand out more. Not too happy with the price after all, but not entirely disappointed. I am using them in my office and after laminating and framing I am sure they will garner positive attention from all who come in.",Neutral
I bought because it was cheaper than the Comfortroll D-Lux tray but there are quality differences. I mistakenly didn't check my tray to the cutout template before cutting. I discovered my tray wasn't square so a couple of screws don't hit. This could have been resolved if the tray cap has the screws set further out on the flange.  One big item is that the trolling motor cable cutout is too far to the left. I had to cut out additional clearance to keep my Fortrex pedal centered. If I didn't clearance the slot then the pedal would have been jammed against the left side of the tray. Other little things are the sloppy waterjet start stops and the fact that every tool slot had to be filed to fit my standard pliers and scissors.  Not the best if you don't like to modify things.,Neutral
"The cup is mostly ok except the vinyl and logo are two different colors and the TM mark shows through the vinyl. It would be fine for me, but it was bought as a gift so I’m a little disappointed.",Neutral

"I got both, they are cute but definitely isn’t worth the price.",Neutral
"Overall this custom made sign is very nice.  Easy to order.  Quick delivery.  However, they used cheap, old, white household string for hanging.  Very tacky and ugly.  Sure it won't be too hard to get different cord and restring, but really? Why cheapen a very nice display this way?  Otherwise this was a very nice product.",Neutral
"It’s a cute concept but it is kind of cheap material and the picture is already cracking. However, it was good in a pinch and my 4 year old loves it so that’s really all that matters!",Neutral
"Very pretty necklace but I returned it.  It is very delicate, which I like but that also seems to make the quality of the chain not very good at all.  It kinks easily and my biggest pet peeve is that hook part of the chain is constantly slipping around to the front of the necklace.  It is almost like the hook is heavier than the heart which weights it to slip to the front.  For the two days I wore it I was constantly adjusting it.  Also, like others said, the heart is very, very tiny (it is super cute) and flips around on chain a lot.  It is so small that it is hard to tell what it is when you are wearing it.  Oh well.  I will keep looking for something similar but a bit more substantial.",Neutral
Sent as a gift,Neutral

Was big on my face and doesn't stay tight on nose,Neutral
Chain is flimsy and turned green within a week.,Neutral
It’s very cute but at tad cheap! Definitely don’t regret buying it for our first Christmas engaged!! Love having Christmas ornaments to remember a time in our lives. Especially now!! Can’t wait to put it up next year!!,Neutral
I have had two of these and both times the chain has snapped. It’s very thin and breaks easily. You cannot add another chain since it runs through the middle.,Neutral
"Missing the heart around the letters I asked for, a little upset because it was for my wedding",Neutral
"This piece looks GREAT once hung on the wall, but the final finish on the piece is rough and needs to be sanded since the finish that's on it raised the grain.  The routing around the letters is also rough like a dull bit was used to create the piece.  If you look at the picture, there is quite a bit of ""chatter"" around the edges.<br /><br />Since this will be hung at 10 feet off the floor, it's not going to be an issue for me, but if it were at eye level, I'd have to sand it a bit to clean it up and then refinish the top coat.<br /><br />Am I happy with it, yes, will I order from them again, probably so, but I expected a better final finish than I received for the amount I paid.",Neutral
"When you look at the pictures, I thought they were matted, not cardboard paper. I didn't realize I would have to turn around and go buy frames to put them on the nursery wall, which was another expense.",Neutral
The ink doesn’t dry,Neutral
"It’s a nice concept. But the spiral is uncomfortable to actually insert without major distortion to the ring. I imagine that a few jewelry changes and the metal will break from repeatedly pulling and pinching the spring back together. The end(s) also rub your nostril and can make a raw spot. Most annoyingly though, the end that rests inside your nostril will unfortunately collect mucus over the day and that’s not something you want to advertise to the public. Overall, it is hard to keep clean and not worth the irritation. I was pretty bummed because I really liked the intended look. Maybe someone with a different nostril shape would have a better experience.",Neutral
Much smaller than I expected. They were cute for the birthday party though.,Neutral
Need something to keep them on... they come off way too easy.  Disappointed I lost.,Neutral
This came with no instructions so I had to mess with the screw and the green sticks to get it to stay. And the a b c thing yea it doesn't work.,Neutral
Looked great on our wedding day but after a couple of days the letters started peeling off,Neutral
The size of the gauge is not accurate it’s TINY.,Neutral
"They are very pretty, but smaller than I expected.",Neutral
"These earrings are very small, which is why I bought them - and thanks for the reviewer who attached a photo wearing them.  They're cute, but they're so small, they are a hassle to get on and off.  And you have to do a lot of bending of the metal hook - not sure what it's called, but the part that goes through your ear - to get them on and off.  Eventually that metal is going to break.  Thus, they're overpriced.  And I have 4mm birthstone earrings, and I really don't think the turquoise is 4mm.  More like 2.5 or 3.",Neutral
"I thought it was like a solid piece of kyanite, not like little pieces inside a ""tube"". Was my bad for not paying attention. My daughter loves it and it is pretty despite my initial reaction.",Neutral
Broke before we got to use it,Neutral
"It’s too hard to put on. It also does not lay flush on my skin, so the features don’t work. It is very pretty though.",Neutral
Not as delicate as the photo shows. Doesn’t deserve the money.,Neutral
stone was lighter shade of pink than in the photo...was looking for something with a darker shade but nice ring for the price,Neutral
Not as bright or colorful in the picture shown..I’ll still use them not the color is off,Neutral
Scent not strong enough of lavender.,Neutral
"Basic gladden tee shirts you find in the craft section at Walmart. Super bummed, ordered white with pink, like shown in the picture and it’s not bright pink. :( there was only only “pink” color option, so The picture they have posted is misleading.",Neutral
Very unique and well loved by my Boys and I.  Unfortunately we’ve already had to replace two of the chains.  Otherwise a great gift idea!,Neutral
"This is a beautiful piece. However, the light sensor, which determines whether or not it illuminates is on the bottom. This makes the light stay on in many situations where it is not needed as there is ample light. This is especially true when using a counter outlet or one close to the floor. Moving th sensor to the top would alleviate the problem, so all that’s necessary is to assemble it facing the other direction.",Neutral
I love it. Exactly as pictured! My only concern is the colors are a little faded.,Neutral
"I’d love to rate this item higher, but unfortunately the sizing was so far off, I haven’t been able to even wear it. The ring itself is lovely, and looks just how I expected. It has a bright, shiny finish and is ever so thin, just like I wanted. But it fits about a full size smaller than what I ordered so I can’t even wear it. It’s just sitting in my jewelry box at this point, which is unfortunate since it is a nice ring. Definitely order a size up from your usual ring size with this one.",Neutral
Lettering is already showing wear. I’d say it’s not durable at all. Been used for 2 weeks.,Neutral
Face carving isn’t very clear. The chain is a choker which arrived tangled.. Wish I waited and bought a better cheaper one I found a couple days later.,Neutral
"I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46. I did contact the vendor but got no response after waiting two weeks to write this review.",Neutral
"Only issue is that this actually doesn't come with a frame, and I've been entirely unsuccessful in finding a 10.5x10.5 frame.",Neutral
"In the picture, there is a patina that is not on the delivered earrings.  If you are looking for the overall look of the earrings, these are great.  I am a little disappointed that they are shiny with no patina, but they are nice and I will still wear them.",Neutral
Nice quality. I liked it. It was a gift and my daughter-in-law did not appeared thrilled.,Neutral
Pictures of necklace and earrings misleading. Not vintage looking at all and much smaller than shown in photo. Love the color though,Neutral
"This item was more poorly made than I expected.  It broke almost immediately the first time I tried to use it.  I was able to fix it so it will still get some use, but it is not what I expected.",Neutral
Did not realize cards were 2 sided!  This was exactly what I was looking for.,Neutral
"This is a beautiful design. I have only given it three stars because after wearing it for two months all the gold has worn off and the tarnished silver is now showing through, particularly where the rings rub together but also around the bottom of the rings. I love the design an the stones are beautiful, however it has not worn well in a short span of time. Saddened by this because otherwise I really like the ring.",Neutral
Loved it but disappointed in the size. Waaay smaller than pictured.,Neutral
i like this. but this is a piece of paper......... not even metal or plastic or anything.... might as well of just made it on my own....,Neutral
I broke shortly have receiving it.,Neutral
These shirts run very small,Neutral
"It's super adorable but its damaged due to shipping. The product is very nice, just sad its bent badly due to shipment being in with other items in the same package",Neutral
Received the product right out of the box with scratches. It’s very thin and not worth the $38 when you include delivery even though I have Prime. Apparently in small print it says there’s a shipping fee. You’d think it wouldn’t arrived scratched up then. Disappointing.,Neutral
I didn’t realize how small the product was gonna be for the price. I also just came in an envelope as a piece of paper so I will have to try to find a frame to put it in or just tack it on the wall.,Neutral
Sizing is really off,Neutral
I liked having my name on it but top would not stay on and you and not charge it using an charger pad. Would not lay flat. So had to order a different case. Wasted my money.,Neutral
I was hoping these would be solid a thicker than they are. The earrings are VERY thin and light weight and I am VERY concerned these will bend. I will update this review in a few months after I’ve worn them a few times. I hope they don’t get bent putting on sweaters and coats in the cold weather seasons.,Neutral
"This was listed as a poster. What I received was an 8×10 print on photo paper. The copy is clear and nice, but you can't just hang on the wall as is. It needs a frame. I was expecting the print on a thicker poster like paper.",Neutral
"Was looking for something shiny to frame for my bedroom/bathroom. I did really like what this said, because the statement is so true!! That being said I thought it would be a little more sparkly/shiny. It comes in gold also, and that appears to look more shiny on my computer, but doesn't go with my decor.  I've ordered a silver mat to put around it, and may bling it out with some little rhinestones, so hopefully with a little ""tweeking"" it will look better. I thought it was kinda pricey for just a piece of card stock.",Neutral
Love the idea and look of these earrings. They look pretty in the ears.  Only problem I had was keeping them in my ears.,Neutral
Too expensive for what i got.,Neutral
It’s expensive.,Neutral
The charm itself was nice but the chain was broken.  The end was totally off  We didn’t send it back as we needed it right away.  Was disappointed,Neutral
I bead the metal bead is ok the dead beads are plastic. But cute.,Neutral
I couldn’t believe how small it was. Too small for a charm let alone necklace. It looked good. You just have to get your eyes to focus on the tiny thing. So sad.,Neutral
Disappointed as there is hardly any color to these earrings. I received bracelet too and it’s the same. Doesn’t look like aquamarine.,Neutral
"The pointed top of the wire hurts my lobes, I can’t wear them more than an hour without them hurting!! I am very disappointed because I think they are beautiful!!",Neutral
Order size down,Neutral
Smaller than expected.,Neutral
Looks like picture but extremely tiny if you have a big nose don’t buy,Neutral
It was broken off base I glued it because it would not have gotten back before Christmas.,Neutral
It looks okay. it looks like a picture printed onto the paper and then outlined in sharpie. The price was great and my spouse loved it.,Neutral
I thought for some reason the pattern was going to be printed on the cover but it is a regular cover wrapped in a printed sort of tape. Works great in its intended room color wise.,Neutral
"It's beautiful at first but after a couple weeks, my charms turned colors and my personalized charms fell off. Not worth the money. Maybe if it was cheaper",Neutral
The writing of my dogs name was hard to read and the telephone number is extremely hard to read.  Disappointing purchase.,Neutral
It's overall a nice bracelet and my granddaughter enjoys hers very much. I was disappointed in the colors. The colors are not as vivid as shown in the picture of the ad on Amazon.,Neutral
"I love the concept, but the text on the back is flaking off and it's not a total black out eye cover.",Neutral
Scent didn’t last very long,Neutral
Nice!,Neutral
"The photo makes it appear that it comes with a frame, however it does not.  You should not include items in pictures that are not included in the product.",Neutral
Some of the photos were not too clear.,Neutral
I was disappointed for the photo of the item looks as though the prints are borderless canvas wrapped.  What I received was paper prints with white borders.  I realize after that they said no frame but consider it deceiving with not a correct photo.,Neutral
It says genuine stone but it’s obviously some sort of colored glue or something similar. It’s still very pretty and is sterling silver,Neutral
Less than expected.<br />Napoleon and Queen Vic had poor senses.<br />Musty and quick dissolving.<br />Once was enough in my venture into<br />history.<br />Other products maybe more desirable. The cost plus shipping is a negative 👎.,Neutral
"These brakes have a design problem for my flexible long board: there's a low spot of the friction material 8-9"" in front of the truck. Company says they can get that clearance to more than an inch with other parts. I don't want to try though, with my bamboo deck. Turns out that's a problem on sidewalks and streets. If brake material drags unexpectedly, on surface irregularities, I'd fly off. I think longboards can't handle any low clearance spots that aren't right near the axles, like the trucks are.<br /><br />Too bad, because brakes would be a great addition!<br /><br />I have a 37"" Sector 9 longboard with drop through trucks.",Neutral
Sits too far down on my head which cause my ears to stick out. I don't normally have this problem with hats.,Neutral
"I was anxious to receive the poster.  The delivery was prompt.  Detail was excellent. Packaging was professional and prevented bending.  Reason for three stars: Clarity-I believe I must have mis read the ordering detail; I did order the car color as black, however I was disappointed as I would have preferred a black outline vs. solid black.  The white background is fine.",Neutral
Great quality,Neutral
You get what you pay for. Pretty cheaply made. But they are cheap so.,Neutral
"I was really excited about this product. I have dry skin so I really like using oil-based cleansers, and I LOVE the smell of palo santo.  So, I was certain that I would love this product.  Well, I do love the cleanser.  It is rich, soft,  and leaves my skin plumped and moisturized, but I HATE the smell.  To me, it smells almost like a bug spray.  I'm dumbfounded because, as I mentioned, I should love this fragrance.<br /><br />I like the product well enough that I probably won't throw the bottle away, unless I find the fragrance gives me a headache, but I don't think I would buy the product again.  Shame, because it is a great product.",Neutral
Much smaller than expected. Pretty color. Decal is EXTREMELY fragile. I would buy another one if it was offered with elephant facing the opposite direction.,Neutral
"Just received these earrings today, and they are pretty. However they did not come with real backs, just the ugly cheap rubber stoppers. Which ruined it for me as now I have to find proper earring backs. I would not have bought them if that had been clear in the description and may return them.",Neutral
worth the money...these were the hit of the Baby Yoda themed birthday party at the Y,Neutral
I ordered 24 inches and it’s smaller than that. Not a big deal as it’s only a half an inch but I paid a lot of money for this product.,Neutral
Tiny tiny tiny. They do not look any bigger than the 3mm earrings.,Neutral
"They're nice and genuine, but the backings fell out. I thought the seller was going to send out an extra set for the 2nd purchase, but only received 1 set. Good craftsmanship on the casings themselves though (I reload so I would know).",Neutral
"It does the job. It’s cute. It’s affordable however..what I did not like from it was the way it was printed. When you peel the sticker off, it cuts off the majority of the flowers. If you know it’s going to cut out the flowers, why not shrink the label into fitting into the size of the sticker? It just looks like a lazy print job to be honest. But again, you get what you pay for.",Neutral
"The tray looks as indicated. My only complaint is that it was 3-D printed. It looks pretty cheesy, I probably should have printed this myself.",Neutral
Nice but think it may be hard to stamp on an egg.  I couldn’t figure it out.,Neutral

The workmanship is great but too big for the yeti.,Neutral
"Product seems great, but was leaking when I opened the package.",Neutral

Cheaply made. Some of the pieces were not properly glued together. My kindergarten students could make these better!!!,Neutral
Product was very difficult to transfer to the wall.  We were unsuccessful and gave up on it.,Neutral
"The cloth itself is quite lovely -- though I would have preferred cloth material to the plastic coated material that it is (although easy to clean). I give it 3 stars because it has no zipper or snaps to take the cloth off the umbrella table. As it is, one would have to take the umbrella out of the table each time you put the cloth on the table and each time you take it off.  I cut the cloth and will have the tailor put either snaps or a zipper on it. I bought two of these cloths in different colors -- really like them both, except for this nuisance. American-made cloths usually come with an &#34;escape route&#34; for those made for umbrella tables.<br /><br />Ruth Dunner",Neutral
Small,Neutral
The item really helped my scalp itch but it leaves a residue. The spray bottle doesn’t work either it’s too big for the bottle and gets stuck. If it didn’t leave the residue on my scalp I would love this product. But I will have to continue looking for something that helps my scalp itch without the white residue.,Neutral
I liked the design but I didn’t have a notebook and had a hard time trying to figure out where to get one. Pretty disappointed.,Neutral
Ordered a painted blue one and they only painted one side and the other side was just smeared paint,Neutral
"Thought it had Canada on it, too, as United States alone was less money.  The order form was a bit misleading to me.  The size, however, is good for a small, vintage camper.",Neutral
Less vibrant than expected and one of the stones cracked apart where it threads onto the bracelet. But it is authentic,Neutral
I'm disappointed with the overall quality of the final outcome. The little circle is off centered and does not cover the whole side that it is meant to cover. It is a basic measuring tape that they got from home depot or lowes and they glued a thin wooden circle to the side of it. The engraving looks fine. No issues there but I'm still wishing that they picked a better size circle of wood or at least centered it better. This is meant to be a gift... and it is barely giftable with the poor attention to detail here. And there's some type of dried glue that didn't get clean up and now it's dried on there unable to take off... was excited for the concept. And I might be nit picking.... but I expected better quality. I guess the measuring tape itself works fine. 3 out of 5. marked down one star for placement of wood and another for the wood glue.,Neutral
Love the design. Unfortunately it was too short. Bought a 2xl. Width was great but length wasn’t equivalent.<br />Still good product.,Neutral
Kool idea . one was perfect one not so great. Engraved a little close to edge. If not for this engraved misalignment I would give 5 stars . but for this alone I give them 3 stars .. Wifes looks great just mine the heart is right on the edge. Little disapointed as time passes I think its going to look well crappy..,Neutral
"I like the weight and size of the necklace but I have two problems with it:<br />1.  The colors are not as vibrant as in the image.  My guess is light would have to hit it for colors to show vibrantly, but who's going to sit in bright light/sun just to show off their necklace?  The colors are dull.<br />2.  The adjustable necklace is awkward.  You can adust it but it leaves a 'pony tail' at the end of the necklace that can only be covered if you are wearing a t-shirt.  Does not look attractive.  Easy fix is to replace the cord (yes, it's just a cord).",Neutral
"It does not work for my son. It is a great quality, but not safe. I am afraid using it as I always think my son will remove his hands and fall down.",Neutral
"The ad does say they are very small in a few places. Anyone complaining about size did not read what they were buying.<br /><br />I have mined Herkimer diamonds, found only in Herkimer, NY. What distinguishes them from regular quartz crystals is that each have 10 facets and double terminations.  The smaller they are, the more likely they are to be crystal clear. The larger ones are more imperfect and sometimes contain sediment.  We were fortunate enough to find 4 golf ball sized “diamonds”, but they were not as pretty as the tiny flawless specimens we have. Odd that these are made and/or sold out of Texas.",Neutral
Disappointed in size.,Neutral
Came bent,Neutral
Great looking chain broke after second time I wore it.,Neutral
"I neither dislike nor hate the images, they're pretty, and the company whom provides the images are super helpful if you have no way of printing out your own images. I just wish I could order just the one image instead of all.",Neutral
Packaging was a little disappointing being A garnet and gold necklace. I planned to gift to my friend for her birthday but I’ll have to find a way to package it so it doesn’t look as cheap:/,Neutral
"My cat didn’t go into a frenzy like normal, so I was a little disappointed. The material and shape were fun, but it seemed like a waste of money.",Neutral
"Bigger than expected, but still very cute and creative",Neutral
They only really show their beauty in very bright light. I think they look better in the picture.,Neutral
"This tarnished pretty quickly after wearing it. I don't ever take it out, because it's so beautiful I just wish it kept its silverness",Neutral
"Cute, but my size small is HUGE! It looks sloppy because of how large it is.",Neutral
A little shorter than I would have liked.,Neutral
"This is a medium V-neck, I’m 5’1 and 140lbs, fits a lot snugger than I expected and the material isn’t as moveable as it appears in the picture. It’s big up top in the shoulder area but right in the stomach.  The picture also shows the shirt tied and you’d have to size up if you want that fit.",Neutral
"I love the positive affirmation quote. However, I expected a poster size, not an 8 x 10. That's my fault for not reading the size. However for the cost, I thought it would be much bigger, as it appeared to be poster-like. I'll be more thorough in my reading next time.",Neutral
More suited to a child than a 16 year old. Unless you want to give an expensive souvenir. The return cost me $15. Waiting for my refund which at least they approved. Lesson learned.<br />Update: my refund was issued immediately upon return and customer service was efficient and prompt.,Neutral
"I am no pearl expert or even amature but these just don't look like pearls. They are are button shaped and flat on the back.<br />They are very cute and they are stamped 925, sterling. They are lightweight and very comfortable. These would make a nice gift for a young girl or someone who just likes minimalist jewelry.",Neutral
okay but not really what i expected,Neutral
Like it good condition,Neutral
It would have been nicer if they were bigger,Neutral
Only took few days for button to break meanwhile I took it out of my pocket maybe 4-5 times.. but it has great leather and feels amazing.,Neutral
Wish it was easy to find 22 inch length necklaces- 16-18 inch are not comfortable for me,Neutral
"I've always loved this image and was looking for awesome art to lead my staircase.<br /><br />I ordered four different prints; however, all images are imposed upon the exact same page from the dictionary, on photo paper.<br /><br />I've seen these before done on actual dictionary pages, but I didn't know these were just digital prints, not paper.<br /><br />I'm hoping people don't look too closely at them.<br /><br />Variety would give this 5 stars. I was just very disappointed that they were all printed on the same background and was computer paper.",Neutral
Really cute. Just thinner and smaller overall than I was expecting.,Neutral
"The chain is good quality, but my only complaint is the closure. Instead of a traditional lobster claw closure, this necklace has a spring ring, and very small connector rings. Long story short, I have to put the necklace on backwards in the mirror, and then turn it around.",Neutral
"It looks like it should be on a metal board, not just a printed picture. I get needing to make money, and I'm okay with that, but 12.95 is ridiculous.",Neutral
Loved it.  I do an ornament each year for my kids.  They moved to Virginia this year!,Neutral
It's a little tricky at first but I figured out how to assemble.  One of them blinked on while the sun was out and then it didn't work at all during the evening. I don't know how to replace that one.,Neutral
The paper is flimsy and they look like they were Xeroxed on a cheap copier.,Neutral
I like it i wont be returning it but not able to wear it on my toe because its too loose. Pops off when i take a step. It doesnt have an adjustable size thing which is fine by me i just really like the design,Neutral
"We loved this customized photo frame for a photo booth for our wedding day. The only unexpected thing was this was poster paper, like the kind of paper you might see a movie or band photo on, tacked on a teenager’s wall. We had to buy a poster board from a box store and find a way to adhere it and cut out the center in order for this to work as a photo frame. If we had known this, we might have purchased something different for ease of assembly.",Neutral
Arrived quickly<br />Very cute<br />Sadly kind of small<br />Nice gift,Neutral
We bought these as a gift. They are nice but are much smaller than we expected.,Neutral
"Glass is nice, chain is cheap",Neutral
"The reviews had mentioned these are small earrings, but that's an understatement.  Putting them on, if you're an adult, is quite a challenge.  And, depending on where the piercing is on your ear, they don't dangle or move at all.  That said, the stones are quite lovely and the very first time I wore them, I got a compliment.  Plus, in these days of mask wearing, they don't interfere or get caught up in the mask.  So, if you have petite ears or are willing to be patient when trying to put them on, they really are very pretty.",Neutral
"Its honestly a nice wall decor, the craftsmanship is superb BUT this is not what I ordered. The border pictured is distressed and that is not what I received. I had to spray paint the border grey to my liking.",Neutral
"Too small for the price, for that price should be canvas, not just the paper",Neutral
The lettering appears to be filled in with sharpie. It is very cheap aluminum. Was expecting something a bit weighty,Neutral
The frame is cute. However the price is absolutely ridiculous. When it came in it looked like a homemade DIY that anyone would have been able to make with things from hobby lobby. Wish I would have gone and made it myself. Would have saved a ton of money.,Neutral
"It fit my Petit Noe width-wise, but it was too tall that it took away from the slouchy look and took away the ability to tie it. I modified it by making it shorter (by a few inches) and now it works with my bag. The pink color is nice. I ordered the petit noe size, so perhaps they sent me the wrong size, but I can’t tell by the packaging I received.",Neutral
The prints have a few dark ink spots on them.  I may return them for new ones,Neutral
This is not really a towel more like a piece of cloth.,Neutral
Exactly like picture. Wish chain was a tad longer tho,Neutral
Hard to put the latch.,Neutral
Stone can out had to super glue it.,Neutral
Picture made it look better. Wasn’t worth the money.,Neutral
It was hard to pull them apart. Some even ripped -_-,Neutral
These earring are nice but beware they are Extremely small.,Neutral
For every clean,Neutral
Gave as a gift. Friend loved them! I was expecting more of a vibrant color. Looks a little more pastel to me.,Neutral
I am a little disappointed in the bow. The red is not a true buffalo plaid red. It has a pinkish hue to it that will not match the red shirt that it was intended to match. It’s soft and stretchy and is comfortable for my daughter to wear.,Neutral
"Bottle was not full, in photos the lane is different as well. I’ll rewrite a review after a couple weeks of working with it.",Neutral
"I was hoping to try out a very small nose ring before purchase and this was bigger than I wanted and more importantly, hard to put on.",Neutral
I like the look of these earrings they are just flimsy and easily loose their shape! They need to be made of better material that is thicker and sturdy. They are cute on I just don’t know how long they will last before they completely loose their shape. They are very light weight and comfortable. I probably wouldn’t have bought them if I would have known how flimsy they were though!,Neutral
Cute but super tiny. I could barely get them over my earlobe.,Neutral
What I do not like it because is very thin.,Neutral
Stickers' color is not as bright and vivid as it appears. I think I could have just printed my own.,Neutral
"So, when I was considering my order, I wanted light to medium brown color band with no ginger or yellow-ish shades.<br />The descriptions and photos looked good to me, but as the result I got this - it is exactly what I didn't want to get in color.<br />Quality is nice (don't really like hard leather bands, I prefer soft leather, but still it's fine) and I'm sure it lasts forever, but can't see it on my skin.",Neutral
Good quality but color wasn't what I expected. Darker then I wanted,Neutral
Works amazing will not smell like body order but will make you smell funny. I don't know how to describe but it will make you smell like spices. And not particularly good smell but not the worst. It works if it all you have .,Neutral
"The earrings and necklace are absolutely beautiful but the earrings are just a little bit too heavy. Craftsmanship is excellent and if the sea glass teardrops were cut in half, the earrings would be more lightweight.",Neutral
Smaller than I thought but pretty just the same,Neutral
Beautifull but mid part the family tree feel off lost,Neutral
Borderline for me. Great looking necklace and Hippo. Put it on daughter and poof 2 hrs later necklace is broke.,Neutral
"Well made and incredibly well packaged. This cookbook is a mini though. It's about the size of a small photo album. I thought it was going to be much larger but I guess I didn't pay attention to the dimensions if they were listed. The pages and lines are so small it practically renders the item useless for any recipe that has any complexity, so a little disappointed. I'm giving three stars because the item is very well made, pretty, VERY well packaged, and the shipping was prompt. I thought I had ordered an A4, but during customization options it/I must have defaulted back to the A6 sizing.",Neutral
"The sign is very small.  Check measurements before you buy.  The finish is rust.  Nit painted, but truly rust.  You might want to paint if you don’t appreciate the rust.",Neutral
"Well I ordered the front and the back letters for my<br />Bronco and I order the carbon fiber decals but I received today my package and practically (and you can tell you a just a stickers, but since the white letters bother me I keep and install on my<br />Car from far looks so nice from close you can tell me a just stickers also I am afraid that it falling when I go to wash the car , to be honest not a good deal for tue price I pay $70 dlls. But I may try other color maybe looks better and no looks like a cheap sticker 😔",Neutral
it was just t small and very hard to put on  smh...,Neutral
It's too small. Material is alright,Neutral
Really cute but would not stick at all🤷🏻‍♀️,Neutral
Gift for a teenager,Neutral
They only issue is the red color fading,Neutral
Nice color. Too small for adult,Neutral
"Some of the holes were too small fit the lollipop sticks I had. Also a part of the border on one side of it was chipped, as if when they were carving it, they made a mistake and felt like it was still ok to send. I was still going to use it until I saw some lollipop sticks could not fit. So i just used floral foam in the end.",Neutral
In the photo they looked appropriate for an adult woman. I would characterize them as more all for a toddler or child. I am wearing them now. They are definitely quite comfortable even when lying in bed. I will probably wear them as an everyday around the house don't think about taking them in and out earing. They are no longer silver colored. I wouldn't mind if they were just an ordinary stainless steel color but they have turned black!,Neutral
"I paid more for this one because I thought it would be a better quality.  The description said ""Engraved"" personalization.  Looks to me like it's mechanically stamped.<br />It didn't have a high gloss finish either. Falls apart when you try to hook up your phone to charge.<br />And to top it off it looks like the price was lowered  $8 after i paid for it!",Neutral
I like the picture however for the size and no frame its a little on the expensive side. I found better looking photos at the dollar store There is nothing special about the paper and it looks like it was printed from the computer; then to top it all off before I even received the picture the price changed by 2 dollars. Just disappointed in the whole thing.,Neutral
I like the size and style of this bag but was disappointed by the color. I ordered it in navy blue and it reads as a strong black.,Neutral
Accidently had the 2nd and 3rd Christmas mixed up. Emailed seller and they made it right with no hassle. Came very nice packaged and turned out awesome.,Positive
I contacted the seller so for a custom request that wasn't listed.  They were super friendly and accommodating.  The decals arrived fast and exactly as pictured.,Positive
Great craftmanship. Terrific price.  Could easily charge more for this. You also get to put your head down at night knowing your money went to some well deserving folks in Indiana.,Positive
This came beautifully boxed and arrived quickly. The necklace is very beautifully crafted.,Positive
Absolutely beautiful stones!! VERY small but incredibly powerful stones. Thank You!!,Positive
"Got them for toe rings. Fast shipping,  fit perfect, excellent quality.  I will be purchasing again.",Positive
Very pretty. My granddaughters liked them.,Positive
My fingers are weak because of aging - so the clip is difficult.  But I like it,Positive
"Have no idea if it does all the things as described in ad, but I like it a lot, it is lightweight and easy to breathe in. I ordered one for my son and after it arrived, I order another one for me.",Positive
I found this customizable penny keychain to give as a gift to someone how has everything. I was surprised it shipped w/in a day of me placing my order. It's rare to have a customized product ship so quick. I'm excited to give this to my daughter. She's going to love it! Thanks & happy new year,Positive
"Very dainty, I have larger wrists and it fit comfortably.",Positive
"Well made and very sturdy.  Looks great in my kids bath.  Mounted directly into stud, no more loosening, wobbly TP holder.  Shelf is large and distressed paint is exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!",Positive
This smells great and really softens my lips. Will keep it handy this winter.,Positive
"Love these, bought them for myself as I am a hardcore tea drinker and love the little silver teabag and teacup charms.",Positive
"Wow this arrived today and I LOVE IT!! I am ordering these for all my other bathrooms now :) The turquoise is so solid, gorgeous and bright! And the wood is colored beautifully and is so smooth.

Looked great on the cup,Positive
Beautiful. Love it,Positive
These are so adorable! Plus the customer service is simply awesome. There was a little mix up with packages but they promptly sent them once more and even gave me a free sample of their line of soap! I love that they went above and beyond for us.,Positive
"These look fine but the headband doesn't seem like it will hold up. Only wore once to the Renaissance festival, hopefully they will last.",Positive
My 50th..,Positive
I've been wanting a way to track our children's growth that could move with us from house to house. I could never find just the right one until now. This is beautiful! We chose a dark wood with white painting and upgraded to the engraved marks and wording. It's perfect! Absolutely spend the extra money and get it engraved. It looks wonderful on our wall and will be cherished for years to come!,Positive
I got this as a gift to my husband and he loves it.  The material they use are very good.,Positive
Beautifully crafted and personal note from the perdon handmade was touching. Great service.,Positive
"Good size, nice looking. Cleaver idea. My daughter is a Disney fan so it made a unique anniversary gift. My only suggestion would be to have the ability to add a gift note. I wanted it to be a surprise and delivered direct to them. When it arrived they didn’t know who sent until I told them. They thought could be from someone else.",Positive
Really love these. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.,Positive

My wife loved it!  Thank you very much!,Positive
Upper management loves it and so do coworkers,Positive

"I am BEYOND just glad and impressed with these little pins. They look exactly as pictured- the colors are bright and they just look damn good.

"Exactly what I was looking for, and the image with size comparison is accurate.",Positive
Love these. Very nice!,Positive
Love these spindles! Very well made and are great for learning to spin.The fiber is gorgeous and very easy to work with. I’ve been trying to learn how to spin and this is by far the easiest spindles for me to learn with.,Positive
Much better and nicer than I expected. It’s realkt top notch.,Positive
the plastic holders are so tiny it is hard to get them on the wires.  Because of this I have already lost one earing.  Bummed.,Positive
"These tend to be a little tighter then the Pearl ones I purchase. Still cute, only wear them for special occasions because I’m afraid they are going to break.",Positive
Just what I was looking for!,Positive
Really good quality. The leather is very soft. I wish the initials were a little bigger but my son likes the size.,Positive

Perfect! Just what I wanted,Positive
"These are great, I like them a lot.  They come in a nice box and they are very comfortable to wear and don't slip.

"I am extremely happy and satisfied with the custom sign I just received. Jason at 3D Woodworker was so gracious as to accommodate my special requests and I was able to communicate with him multiple time along the process. Delivery of the completed sign was done a week before the deadline. Carving of my favorite phrase was beautifully done on good quality wood and I just love it.  Nice job and thanks again, Jason!",Positive
"I bought this item as a gift for myself and I love them, no more cold or wet hands from cold drinks.",Positive
"The materials and build quality of this particular pocket organizer are exceptional.  The brown leather is thick, durable and carries well.  The leather has worn around my tools and even holds the shape once they’re removed.  Placing them back in elicits an audible sound that I can only describe as comparable to holstering a firearm or knife into a good kydex holster.<br /><br />The materials supersede the price.  I have several of their products and will continue to be a repeat customer.  The products also arrived earlier than listed.<br /><br />***It should be noted that there’s a significant different in the thickness and quality of the brown leathers they use and the black ones.  Black leather is much thinner and doesn’t hold up as well as the thicker brown options. Sticking is also kinda loose due to the weaker leather. Attached photos show some of the differences in thickness.  There is a significant step DOWN in quality when ordering the black leather version of this product.<br /><br />5 stars for the brown version<br />2 stars for the black version",Positive
They look really cute on my shoes!,Positive
"Very nice, sturdy and colorful banner!",Positive
"Initially, I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be silver but was clear. I do still love it.",Positive
Amazing quality and clarity! I thought from other reviews it wouldn't appear clear but the text is very clear. Make sure you order the dark colored wood and choose white text. I love it!,Positive
The recipient of the notebook absolutely loved his gift and felt its craftsmanship was excellent and that its beauty would inspire his creativity.,Positive
Beautiful workmanship and worth every penny. Would definitely order something else.,Positive
Better than I hoped. We live on a walking path and just had some trees planted. Some owners think the yard is their dog’s toilet so I wanted to get the point across without being obnoxious. It’s worked perfectly and I think it’s because they’re bright/friendly and not a crude message like so many signs. Hand painted too - each one is a little different. They’re sturdy and thick and both are holding up in the rain. Happy to recommend.,Positive
It was as described and makes a nice addition to my beer glasses which we use for everything but beer!,Positive
"All I can say..... Awesome, just Awesome!",Positive
"I wanted this a bit customized.  I added a color stone and a couple more letters.  I had to contact the seller to figure out how to do the add-on's.  Basically, she has them available, but you need to add them to the same initial order.  It turned out great.  My wife likes it.  I am very happy with this.",Positive
"Love it! Def on the smaller size of 14 in  and needed a slightly bigger extension, which luckily I already had so it worked out well , maybe  include 3 inch extension vs a 2 inch for us bigger girls.. ( I am 5’3 and am 190 so I guess my neck isn’t average) but otherwise I’m in love it is beautiful and dainty and I will def be getting another my daughters have already tried to “borrow” it .",Positive

Whether your mom doesn’t want your earring pulled or wearing a baseball cap and still trying to look feminine these airings for the perfect sparkle stud size.  I have a lot of hair and they still stood out through my hair even when it was down.<br />Can dress it up or dress it down! I’m actually buying a second pair so that if I lose one I’m still ready to go. Interview for a pageant or grocery store,Positive

"My son loves his gift!! Tried to get the album, but ran out of time!! Love the poster anyway…  also received a bonus or an accidental poster of Ariana grande. Thanks if a bonus! Will return if not…",Positive
"Everything about it is perfect except for the string; the one chosen makes the piece rather breakable, especially if using them as mala/prayer beads. On the plus side, it also makes using it as such very quiet which is useful if you meditate at times where it was best you weren't a nuisance (small spaces, late hours).. Being smaller beads, it is also a bit more classy, and less in your face than most mala beads, for if you wish to use it in public without as much judgment from others",Positive
Very cute! I do wish there was an option to pick the symbols that I wanted because I asked for a nautical symbol and got an anchor when I wanted a compass haha. Very quick service and a nice quality for the price.,Positive

The piece was beautiful and sturdy but lightweight. I love it! We hung it today and I can't wait to use it!,Positive

They are sturdy, professional quality, and so adorable! Thank you so much for such a good product and great service!",Positive

Awesome,Positive

This is well made and looked beautiful on our tree,Positive
I have a big wrist and this works perfectly.  It's sooooo sparkly and pretty-- almost a little overwhelmingly.  I think I need to go smaller if I want something for every day wear.  The blue is super bright and it's lovely!,Positive
"I am so impressed with this necklace. The quality of the stone is beautiful, with a rich golden color and milky white. Good vibes too. The wiring is strong for every day use. I will def buy from this vendor again.",Positive
Very pleased with this soft T-shirt. Good fit and well made. Great color choices!,Positive
"Excellent cnc cuts on all of the components and it was well packaged. No damage and the custom laser work was spot on. The ONLY suggestion I would make is to offer options for the hands, out of the box it comes with black hour and minute hands, which are nice and right sized, but the sweeping second hand is fire engine red. I think offering a choice of hand designs/colors would put that last finished touch on the piece. Otherwise, great product.",Positive
My mom loves these. She says the scent is a thousand times better than the store bought ones. Would definitely purchase again!,Positive
My daughter loved it! Plan on ordering more!,Positive
"I like the peridot earrings very much, they are a nice color. I bought them for my granddaughter's 7th birthday as she recently got her ears pierced.  When she opened the box she was very happy!",Positive
Love the smell wish it was stronger,Positive
Adorable and so cute! I bought these for my daughter's sweet 16 and they are so cute!  These will make the party.,Positive
"I’ve been having difficulties with my tragus piercing. It wasn’t healing properly and it was hard finding they right jewelry for it. The earrings were hard to get in and they kept falling out. I think they were rejecting. Anywho, that all stopped when I got this L shaped piercing. It was easy to get in and once in it stayed in. I’ve only had it in for about a week now and my piercing is fully healed and it hasn’t come out at all. Now I only want to were this type of piercing. Hopefully I can find more just with different studs.",Positive
Another great work. Thank you,Positive
Beautiful piece. Sturdy and crafted well!,Positive
"Soft gold color surrounded with lace, it blends in beautifully with the room.",Positive

"Sticks perfectly and went on with such ease, my daughter absolutely loves it....thanks",Positive
Really nice. I have gotten stares and compliments.,Positive
Exactly as advertised and shipped carefully as you would hope for.  I recommend these Prints as a nice gift for the Guitar fans in your life.,Positive
I truly like this product however the discs are way too small to write on.  I have a granddaughter Cheyenne and grandson Christian these name are long and you really can’t fit them in the very small disc that come with the plaque.,Positive

"Product came in quickly and was perfect! Easy to read, doesn't turn your finger green, and so cute!",Positive
This product is so amazing! I wanted something unique that I could display in my house instead of a traditional book that would be thrown in a box and never looked at again. This is perfect. The seller was so kind and helpful and messaged me to ensure I like the placement of everything before making it. The attention to detail and customer service combined make this worth every one penny and then some! I went out on a limb (no pun intended lol) to support small business and it was a great decision!,Positive
I like these as much as the silver version i received last year!,Positive
very nice,Positive

"Perfect, Engraving Is nicely detailed and picture perfect in quality. A little messaging with the seller got me EXACTLY what I wanted in this key chain. Not only is the quality superb the speed in which they had it done and shipped is faster than I could have ever expected.",Positive
This was the best card EVER. My husband loved it. He usually hates getting any cards for holidays but this card made him laugh so hard.,Positive
 ,Positive
Great buy,Positive
Bought one than bought 3 more. Turned out way nicer than the photos. Love them Gave as gifts and they cried,Positive

My mom loved it. Thank you,Positive
Awesome design! Perfect for the young women in my life who will graduate in May.,Positive
Husband luvs it.looks great on.,Positive
This is a very high quality case.  I am very pleased with the quality.  The magnetic clasp closes well even with several cards in it.  The magnetic phone case comes out of the wallet for wireless charging.  If they could find a way for it to wirelessly charge in the wallet case this would be a home run!  I love it and would purchase it again!,Positive
Wanted to get a small personal gift to give along with cash to my niece for graduation. She received a seal of biliteracy for American Sign Language so this personalized cuff bracelet seemed perfect. I was worried I might not get it in time but the seller responded quickly to my message and got it shipped right away. Just received it today and I couldn't be happier. It's adorable and the packaging is cute as well.,Positive

My 15-year-old grandson asked for this type of bracelet for his birthday.  He loves the look and fit of this bracelet which he wears with several others.,Positive
"I haven’t worn, or wanted to wear a necklace in a long time. This is just what I was searching for and I love it. Between the meaning of the hand and stones, I feel stylish and protection. You can tell he puts his love into the creation of the jewelry. Thank you.",Positive

Exactly as ordered.  Very cute. I would order again.,Positive
"This is a high quality item. Be advised that the wallet is darker than it looks on the photos and the artwork is more difficult to see, but a great wallet nonetheless. Hail Odin!",Positive
"I tend to gravitate toward things that are different so I absolutely love this. I can't wait to buy more of her pieces, I've actually made a list of what I want. This ear cuff is very comfortable and eye catching. Everyone's ears are different so the chains may not drape exactly the same way. On me, they hang down and don't touch my ear lobe at all.",Positive
This is very awesome. It actually hangs on the wall and doesn't come with a stand like the photo but my boyfriend loved it for xmas. It's smaller than I thought but still very nice item for pinhead fans.,Positive
This is such a historic and vintage gift for Drummers. I`m sure my brother will love it!,Positive
Looks bulky .,Positive
"The sign came very quickly. It is exactly as described and the perfect size. The only thing I would change is the ribbon, as I feel it will fray easy.",Positive
Beautiful! So much more beautiful in person! I’ll be buying again for future gift giving!,Positive
Bought it for my daughter birthday and it's great. I was able to personalized it with just my daughter name and year birth just fine.,Positive
Ok,Positive

"For the Star Wars fan, my 10 year old loves it",Positive
super cute!! highly recommend this product if you’re looking for a sturdy airpod case that lasts a long time!,Positive
"Perfect accessories for my laundry room. They arrived in the time promised and the value and price can't be beat. They do not come framed, which I knew from reviewing the details, but a quick trip to the dollar store remedied that. I would recommend this item and I would purchase from this vendor again.",Positive
"We loved this banner ! It for perfectly with my 5 year old birthday theme. Shipping was great, and the quality was better than I expected!",Positive

I wanted a cute pair of Doxies that weren't too big. There was another pair I was looking at but the reviews were poor. These are perfect...and look great. So I bought another pair for my dil who gave me my first Dachshund and turned me into a  crazy dog lover. We love them!,Positive
"So pretty, they are a little heavy but not not uncomfortable.  I really like that a cleaning cloth was included and cleaning instructions.",Positive
"This was my first purchase from Amazon handmade and I am very satisfied. The triangle arrived in a reasonable amount of time, was already assembled, and is well made and sturdy. Most importantly, our (very active) 16 month old loved it immediately! It's a great addition to our small apartment.<br /><br />ETA - reducing one star after several months of use, because the lack of a latch or lock feature is nerve-wracking. It easily slides closed when my toddler leans against it and can fall over. We are trying to figure out a DIY lock method.",Positive
"This is a beautiful map for sure. If you have a big wall definitely spend the money to get the bigger one, it’s worth it.",Positive
Nice,Positive
Absolutely love these necklaces! I got them for my daughter and I. We love Gilmore Girls and couldn’t be happier with our necklaces ❤️,Positive

"These are extremely well made and work perfectly. My workbench is about 3"" thick and I drilled 3/4"" dog holes in them spaced 5"" apart. I have no doubt these holdfasts will last forever. Will buy again.",Positive
"cute design, cute sayings, good materials. well made, easy to hang up...great gift...great value for the money",Positive
Great,Positive
I am very impressed with the quality of this leather cover. It’s super handsome and feels great. i just started bullet journaling and it definitely makes me want to keep it with me and write in it. I loved the ability to add my name in the bottom corner and it was the right size and font. I was sad when I got the first scratch on it as it seems like a magnet to them but console myself with the fact that I am making it mine which will not look exactly the same as anyone else’s. I would highly recommend this product and seller.,Positive
"Adorable bracelet, my daughter in low love it. She is skinny and have no problem to slid it down. I read some reviews where people say it didn't fit !!",Positive
Bought this in 2 colors. Great for keeping towels in place.,Positive
love the sticker it looks great,Positive
Fairly standard print quality. The vintage style is very appealing,Positive
Calm and reassurance flow from this beautiful sculpture of the the contemplatlive with her her little cat asleep in her lap.<br />Patina is a very deep warm grey.  It can stand alone of a hang on the wall. Another treasure of the faith from these gifted artists.,Positive

In adjusting label on cup middle letters stuck to cup and are a little out of alignment.  Nice looking though,Positive

That's the way you can surprise your wife....!!!,Positive
Very vintage and quality rich. Made with love and passion!,Positive
"Yes, I ordered this for my husband, the strong biker type.  He loves it!  Living in the climate we do, powder helps a lot. The scent is perfect for a man, but would work well for woman.  I ordered the Dragon's Blood scent from De'esse Boutique also, which is another scent that works well for men.  And, I can't say enough about the customer service.  De'esse Boutique is one of the best stores I've done business.",Positive
Used this for my office for my patients to see at The Substance Use Disorder Clinic,Positive
Love this mailbox stencil!! Customer service was absolutely outstanding!! Item arrived before date promised with detailed instructions for installation.  Highly recommend this seller!,Positive

These are fun and always get comments. Great quality,Positive
This item is well made. I had a hard time selecting a color/patina because there are so many good ones to select from.  I decided I picked the wrong color after it arrived and I put it on the wall so I simply spray painted it a different color- problem solved.  Looks great.,Positive
Love the artistic W it looks beautiful above our entry.,Positive
"The piece is larger than expected and heavier than I thought it would be, but not uncomfortable. It is really a lovely piece and unusual. Colors are vibrant and I was so happy with the purchase.",Positive
Very cool and the packaging was awesome!,Positive
These are beautiful.  The weight is not too heavy but you know they're there. Perfect,Positive

Could've came with frame but still pretty,Positive
This is a beautiful print. It arrived in perfect condition and was exactly as described.,Positive
"This was actually just a ""gag"" gift for Christmas for my wonderful son-in-law, however it is made quite well and although he will probably only wear it around his house or our house - it was worth every cent.",Positive

"Gave to my sister and she fell in love. Nice thickness, vibrant colors, and has a nice fit.",Positive
"Great Christmas gift for my husband. I was sick of purchasing a new wallet for him every year. There is no stitching and the leather is thick and not made from smaller pieces so it really looks like it will last for many years. Personalized and custom made. I paid $85 and would do so again.  I'm sick of paying $25 for a wallet that lasts maybe 2 yrs. I did a lot of research before buying this product. Wonderful, American made, created by a true craftsman instead of in a sweatshop and sold by a major corp.",Positive
Good print. I was hoping for something larger. Didn’t read size correct. Will work just fine,Positive
I loved how my cake topper came out. The colors are true to what you see and the glitter isn't glitter that comes off. The only con is that they're a little flimsy I mean it is paper...I almost ripped it when trying to put on the stick. So just be careful!,Positive
Bought these for my sister's Baby Shower.  They were perfect and she loved them.,Positive
Last night was the first night I used the pork<br />Puller. Where has this been my whole life. Great product and craftsmanship.,Positive
I learned somethings about my partner I didn't even think to ask. I would recommend getting these cards if you have questions but don't know how yo ask.,Positive
Love this lotion! I've since bought a huge amount from them. Best lotion I've used in years!,Positive
Very beautiful and unique earrings.  Change color based on what they are near or movement.,Positive
Perfect and they custom colored it for us..just what our spa needed!,Positive
"This is simpler designed costume jewelry. While the quality is really decent, it’s obvious it’s not real and my nieces have asked to borrow it for theater and dress up. May order another so they have one!",Positive
"Got it for mothers day, she hasn't take it off since, looks great with everything",Positive
Unicorn obsessed daughter loves it,Positive
Was very nice and looks great in my cabin,Positive

Arrived on time. Looked exactly how I wanted it. Excellent product,Positive
Love this print!,Positive
I bought the necklace for my granddaughter's birthday.  She was wanting an opal and thought this was absolutely gorgeous!,Positive
My father had this exact Spud’s shirt in the 80’s. I wanted to mess with him a little on Halloween and dress up like him before he and my mother had me and my brother. It was well worth the money! We had a blast!,Positive
"I was trying to find something unique that was made of wood to celebrate my 5th wedding anniversary.  These cute puzzle piece ornaments fit the bill perfectly.  They are well-made and very cute!

Really nice craftsmanship. Will probably order a bigger size.,Positive
It came out absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much!,Positive
I love the design on this cup I love everything about it!!!,Positive

My friend loved this so much. This is such a great and easy gift. Even came wrapped!!,Positive
"I got this for my mom’s birthday celebration as she turns 50 this year, it’s very interesting to see the facts and see how much things have changed. It’s relatively small, like regular letter paper sized, but printed on thick paper, and comes in a protective clear sleeve. Very cute addition to the festivities.",Positive
Beautiful!!,Positive
"I bought two pairs of earrings. In the package was a hand written note that made this buying experience even more heartfelt. I had purchased the earring for my school districts Disney day. Their products are reasonably priced, well packaged, good quality, and I would buy more from them! I’m relieved to find a product that I can use with my allergies. The previous review was placed on this item but was meant for another product. My mom had written it about a pasta machine she purchased. So disregard the “ negative “ comments by my mom Joann Mosher they were in error.",Positive
I got my monies worth with these ones. Just beautiful.,Positive
I ordered this to be used as the guest book for my husband’s memorial service. He loved turtles. This will become a treasured keepsake. I ordered the birch finish. It is beautiful.,Positive
This product looks great! Very satisfied with my order! Got here promptly. I would definitely reorder from this business.,Positive
"I bought this necklace in rose gold and have worn it constantly since receiving it over three weeks ago. Even through many showers, the necklace looks as good as it did the day I first put it on. The chain does tangle up if I wear it with another necklace, so I've just been wearing it alone. I get lots of compliments on the necklace, and I like the look of the square tag. I purchased it in the 16 inch length",Positive
My husband loved this soooo much. Amazing gift for him,Positive
It took a while to come in but it was totally worth the wait,Positive
"A couple things to note:<br />-The folio arrived from China packaged very nicely. They took a lot of care to prevent damage during shipping.<br />-The folio is well made. I used to own a Saddleback medium notepad holder but sold it on eBay because it was just too big and heavy to fit anywhere. This straddles the line perfectly between high quality leather and portability.<br />-The legal pads they recommend you use are 8.5x11.75. When you tear the sheets out they are normal 8.5 x 11.<br /><br />There was a little bit of oil on the folio when I received it, presumably from conditioner they applied before shipping. At least they took the time to apply it. Recommend you take a dry rag and wipe it down, otherwise you might get some staining on your papers for a few days.<br /><br />Great company!",Positive
Great products...thanks for the soap samples!,Positive
"I do not have a swan like neck and these are the perfect length. The quality is amazing, I have purchased four different pairs and they are all beautiful.",Positive
"The noodle board is made of natural wood and the custom wording was able to capture my thoughts. I used this as a cover to the shelves above the stove, and placed hinges on the top.  I am planning to make it look like a continuous vent hood, and without the hurricane damage on the walls.",Positive

I'm a plus size woman. My adult son is tall and slender. My adult daughter is petite. We wore them comfortably all day.",Positive
"LOVE THIS NECKLACE!!! That’s all I can say. I’ve gotten 2, the first one I lost jumping into a lake during the summer. Ordered a second once the minute I realized I lost it. I felt naked without it! I wear this everyday. Part of the threading on the rope/chain peeled off but doesn’t bother me at all. Definitely recommend!",Positive
Super easy to install.  Instant results.  Strong magnets.  Totally worth every penny.  Of all the mods I've made to the G920 (which is everywhere on my rig) this is the one improvement that all users should do.,Positive

"I am not familiar with bright satin finish sterling, so it's my fault for my ignorance. The piece is matte finish. Not like traditional sterling jewelry with mirror finish shine. So it looks like a non-descript metal instead of sterling to me. I believe it is what is being described (925 sterling silver) but this review is just to inform others that it's not glossy. That's probably on purpose to avoid fingerprints. It was well made, heart cut in the right place, engraving looks fine, comes in a cute little box and packaged well. Thanks!",Positive
"Great option over hooks, very nice set of affordable straps to hang our vintage tapestry.",Positive

I had Hot Wheels when they were introduced in 1968. Track clamps like this were available but had very limited function. This item is very versatile for mounting needs. My grandson loves it. Thanks for a great product.,Positive

I came across the personalized recipe cards and thought it was perfect. The product was simple, but beautiful. It was well made and would stand up to getting flour and sugar on it. You are able to title the cards anyway you like and it blends nicely with the other print. It doesn't look like an after thought. I was amazed how fast it was shipped to me during the Christmas holiday. The price was reasonable for a personalized product. My mother in-law loved it.",Positive
Perfect for crafting,Positive
Beautiful! These bracelets completed my prom look :),Positive
Nice well printed .,Positive
So I was seen these rings awhile back and another one came up and was cheaper so I got the other one . Well of course something happened  it was cheap so I came back to this ring . Looked at the reviews seen they were good . I got today and I love it fits wonderful . Also I'm saying I should have just gone with this ring in the first place bc one waisted money two it is going to last longer . Money is worth it.,Positive

"I didn’t pay much attention to the reviews when I should have. Some of the reviews comments were about having the name painted was not worst the money, they were right.

Exelente,Positive
Great mask for adults or kids. For kids lace can be twisted with a cross for better fit. Very easy to breeze,Positive
This clock is so beautiful! I had seen one like it on Pinterest and knew I wanted it for my unborn son's nursery 🥰. It works great and does not tick but the second hand just glides along the ring. I'm confused that the rating asks about thickness as this as a very lightweight and thin clock but well made! Very easy to hang and super attractive. Only complaint is the second hand came in a bit bent. It came a long way and was carefully packaged so I'm not deducting stars for that. Very happy with this item!,Positive
They are adorable Mr & Mrs signs perfect for my wedding decor.<br />Love them!,Positive
This is a high quality brush.  I’m very pleased with it,Positive

"This set of four hanging urchin air plants came in a lovely draw string bag, well wrapped and perfectly healthy. Included is a card with care instructions for the air plants.<br /><br />I took many pictures so you get a feel for what they look like in different lighting. I chose to hang the urchins in a bathroom window and I smile whenever I see them. Each urchin is a different size with unique finials at the top. The line they hang on is the same length for each and have small crystals on them. A hook at the top makes them easy to hang.<br /><br />The largest urchin is a lavender/white with a large green air plant. The next size to the largest and the smallest urchins are light orange. The one next sized to the largest has a lovely air plan that is a silvery green on the top with a reddish color on the underside of the plant. The super unique urchin is a light purple/white with little nubs. The finial is larger than the other ones and the plant is more of the type I've seen before. Because each is so different, they really add character and the varying shapes of the plants give the illusion of movement.<br /><br />When I took a picture for my mom, she said it looked like they were in an aquarium. If you love unique items, you will love this. It is absolutely worth the price in my book and would make a lovely gift.",Positive
I had it for 1day and the metal broke at the top,Positive
I really really really love it soooo much .. I will order another one sooon .. I recommend it as a gift for anyone even for yourself 😍😍,Positive

Kelly the shop owner was very responsive to my requests and edits and I had the invitations in hand in less than a week from the order date. Highly recommend this small business!",Positive
"This provides an easier way to take notes in a meeting rather than using the project planner sheets.  Sometimes I'm just attending a meeting that is not related to a project I am working on, and these are good for documenting those meetings.",Positive
"I got this lamp for my best friend and I. The instructions were a little confusing. And have yet to be able to figure it out, honestly I gave up and haven’t tried again. The app wants you to buy more in the app so I am confused.",Positive

"Love this bag. good size, good straps, and holds a ton of weight. get compliments on it all the time.",Positive
I absolutely  Love these earrings.  I wear them almost everyday,Positive
"I ordered the 40"" (with blue handle) diamond willow walking stick and, boy, was I delighted in the quality craftmanship of my stick. There were oodles of diamonds in the wood--it looked great! I also love the handle--it fits my hand perfectly. I'm physically disabled and wanted a walking stick in lieu of the crappy metal crutch I've been using for years. This stick works perfectly, from it's cushiony braided wrist strap to it's no-slip rubber bottom. I couldn't ask for a better stick. Plus, the maker was approachable and easy to contact!",Positive
The fact that the paper pages are actually cut out was really impressive. High quality product. I really recommend it as a novelty gag gift.,Positive
"I love it! I was gifted this for my first Christmas as a Mommy. I have worn it every day for nearly 3 years (give or take a handful of days) and it is still as perfect as day 1! I shower, swim, and sweat in it!<br />I contacted the company when my 2nd baby bird was born and they were happy to work with me on sending another bird without my having to purchase another necklace. When my 3rd baby came along, my 2nd bird had somehow gotten lost. I contacted the company again and they were again happy to work with me on getting 2 more baby birds.<br />Keeping them on speed-order for baby #4 - in a couple years!",Positive

"This is an Amazon Vine review of the Tongnan mens leather bracelet (style ‘B’)<br />  I’ve been wanting to get one of these bracelets for a while, but never pulled the trigger until now.  I loosely measured my wrist and then purchased the 8.07” version, and it fits perfectly!  The bracelet comes in a nice case actually, I was impressed immediately when I unpackaged this item, the case is very nice.  I’m also very pleased with the fit and comfort of this bracelet.  The leatherwork is nicely done, and all the beads are tightly in place, which is a plus.  I did have a little bit of difficulty trying to get the clasp on with my one remaining hand.  It’s not impossible, but it is a little difficult for sure, I’m sure I’ll get better at it, and I do like the clasp, it is also nicely constructed.  I am afraid that one of the times when I put it on. I’m going to pull a hair or two out of my arm as the clasp closes, but it hasn’t happened yet!  All in all, I like the bracelet and will be wearing it quite regularly.",Positive
[[VIDEOID:74b0dfef30c5b850defa324fa39ea668]] Love me some Post Malone. How cute is this air freshener! Smells is nice and neutral but it doesn’t last.. which is fine.. I mainly got this for the looks. I don’t regret this order. I love it.,Positive

Good quality and excellent fit on a custom order. The seller even sent me an email upon receiving the order on how to maintain the shape of the cozies. I like that the crocheted cozies are flexible enough that I can use them on other bottles and cans that might be a little shorter and wider.,Positive

What a nice way to show someone how grateful you are to have them in their life. Bracelet stretches for proper sizing and feels solid with some weigh to it. Giftable box is 1st class!,Positive

I get a lot of compliments wearing this,Positive

Super cute. It ended up arriving broken and I didn’t order a new one because it didn’t fit where I had to put it (due to another outlet cover nearby) which is my fault. I was able to return it and was refunded easily and the seller was very kind. 4/5 stars because it dies look better in pictures than in person and is a bit more fragile than expected.,Positive

"Very well-made, clean corners, and cuts Painted nice. And packaged very secure. Came all the way to AK with no dings scratches or bends.",Positive

Very cool design for how the different beads are held in place.  Feels substantial on your wrist similar to a quality watch and band.  I appreciate the mix of Tigers Eye, Hematite and black Obsidian.",Positive
Very cool,Positive
Colores brillantes,Positive
Very comfortable.  Looks nice.. light weight.,Positive
Better than expected,Positive
Lovely print.  Fits well into my decor.  I used a vintage frame and I love the look.,Positive
Great quality product,Positive
"I purchased the jellyfish dictionary wall art print in conjunction with products from 3 other companies who produce comparable images to create a 30 image gallery wall. Having said that, this was the only image that I purchased that was on photo paper. I was surprised, but I’m putting it in a frame so it shouldn’t be noticeable. I would almost argue that it makes this print more giftable, because it’s not as delicate. However it was disappointing that it wasn’t an authentic dictionary page.  This was one of my more muted prints and I was worried that the colors would be too soft to stand out from 29 other images.  The image quality is awesome!  It has a nice saturation to the colors.",Positive
"This was a gift for someone else, It looked beautiful!!",Positive
Very cool stuff,Positive
fashionable,Positive
"I am absolutely in love with my stethoscope decal! I like that there were several options for customization, and I can't wait to apply it to my laptop case. I know that all of my friends in medical school will be jealous! Always happy to support a small business.",Positive
"My bf loved this gift, a constant reminder that his boys love him while he’s at work!!",Positive
"Came to me very quick, which is always appreciated! It's the 16&#34;x20&#34; size. Only minus one star because its very hard to know what color you're getting with the color chart.  We got 29 & 44. The pink color is slightly off from what I was expecting. The gray tone is just right. We're using 3- 4 different colors for the wedding dayand can't wait to see it finished!  Habent tried the download links yet to say if they're good/bad.",Positive
"Absolutely stunning ring. When I first ordered this, I was expecting a fake stone made with some janky sticker and a muddy piece of plastic but what arrived was absolutely magical. Definitely living for the handmade touches done by the artist! I cannot rave enough about this product and this retailer. I will definitely be purchasing here again in the future for myself or for my friends because I know these guys won’t disappoint.",Positive
We ordered this to give as a birthday gift. The person who received it is quite happy with it and has several bottles of whiskey in it. The lighting is a great addition. Workmanship is very good. I would not hesitate to make another purchase from this craftsman.,Positive
"Bought for my granddaughter across the country. She opened it on face-time and it was as lovely as picture, packaging was as big a gift as the necklace.",Positive

I bought these for a gift but liked them so much that I kept them for myself. 😁,Positive
"This made the most perfect mother's day gift! Beautiful, well made and unique.",Positive
I am very happy to write this review. The scrabble letters were just as described and they arrived well packaged and in tact.  The quality was excellent and gave an edge above the others because of the deeply carved letters also light enough to hang with command strips .  I absolutely loved it and frankly for the quality and size of the tiles its was worth the money spent. Thank you guys for add-in value to my modern farmhouse look!,Positive
They were fine. I returned them because we decided on a different style. Everything was fine and they looked just as expected.,Positive
"Almost exactly a year ago, I ordered this decal sticker in the #10 font, 4&#34; high with purple glitter to personalize the back window of my SUV. I love almost everything about it! Up until about a month ago, it was still perfect. Then it started getting some spots on it, likely from weather and car washes (although I do live in San Diego, so we mostly have nice temperatures with sunny skies). It still looks fine from a car length away, but up close you can tell. In any case, I don't mind spending $17.50 annually to have a cute personalization on my car!",Positive
The couple loved it!!,Positive
The item was just as nice as it's online photo indicated.  The friend I gave the necklace to was delighted.,Positive
I love this felt garland. So cute and done well. I wish I would have seen these listings previously to me buying similar ones on Etsy for over double the price! Seriously dont waste your time with the highly rated Etsy sellers. They messed up my order and still conned me!,Positive
"This awesome print is as amazing as it looks. I have it hung on my wall in my office, and people often say that it made their day.",Positive
Laminated them and put them up in my office where I serve Vets and military personnel.,Positive
"Beautiful! Well made and there was a handwritten note in the Box too. Nice personal touch. I was so pleased I cried. I'd been searching for something like this mobile for months. I'm decorating my sons room and nothing was right, this exceeded my expectations.",Positive
This bracelet seems very sturdy and made well. It has 3 rows of beads are tightly put together making the bracelet thick like a cuff. The band allows for easy on and off and adjusting to the width of the wrist. The colors of the beads pop as well! Great gift for a man or even a woman!,Positive
"This is a very hight quality product and very easy to install. Literally changed the look of my house, got lots of compliments from neighbors.",Positive
I love it. Its a beautiful touch to my daughter's  nursery.,Positive
"Iit's cute,but,and there's always a but..it needs a felt backing on the magnet. As you spin it from dirty to clean, ect..it scratches the appliance.",Positive
"My wife loved it and was moved to tears over it, I am very pleased with this product! Made for a wonderful Mother's Day!",Positive
Great organizer!,Positive

Xmas gift for my daughter and she lived it,Positive
Perfect gift for a grandparent/great-grandparent.,Positive
"I love jade, the lighter the jade, the more expensive it is, this bracelet is really pretty, but too much marble to say it’s perfect, the beads are not uniform, and if I hadn’t known so much about jade, I would not have known these defects, but it’s still a pretty bracelet, I’m hesitant to tell anyone it’s real jade as I have a real jade bracelet & I know what real jade looks like.  But I love the bracelet despite it’s flaws!",Positive
Cute sign!,Positive
It is beautiful and well made. I love it.,Positive
So soft,Positive
Solo que debían dar la opción de cual de los NOMBRES debe ir en el centro .gracias,Positive
At first I was a little nervous because there was only 100 reviews but I decided to order this item because it was personalized vs a standard guestbook that are available at big companies/stores. It came in packed very secured and the item was perfect. We love it and are excited to be able to also display this personalized item in our home vs putting it away in a box after the wedding.,Positive
My middle schoolers now walk around talking about big fish mindset!,Positive
"Great product - looks just as advertised. Comes in very nice little packaging - which isn't all to important, but it's a nice indication that they take pride in their work. Seems very sturdy and will last a lifetime - I've only had it a day, I'll update my review if it starts falling apart, but I doubt it.<br /><br />There are a few negatives - but only specifically for my use case. I had the idea of using this as a sort of pocket wallet replacement - and it seems like that won't be a great idea with this. The leather is quite thick (about .8cm on either side) and the texture is fairly grippy, making it a pain to take in and out of pockets. But the product is as advertised, and I can't really complain that it doesn't fit in my pocket, when I knew the size before I bought it.<br /><br />Another minor point is that the pen loop (I opted for the larger pen loop) makes it fold a little more asymmetrically - but that might go away when it's broken in.",Positive
I'm the star of the Show with this item... That is with the wife's permission...,Positive
"I would have given it 5 stars, but I wished it had been much bigger. I had the measurements. So, I should have known better.  It was all my fault!  It was cute as could be!!! Good quality too!!",Positive
BEAUTIFUL!!  Very reliable service and pleasant attention to detail.  Have bought several angels<br />for friends and family.,Positive
Es un regalo encantador,Positive
"The hitch cover is even more stunning than the photo; it truly is a work of art.  It's nice to have something so beautiful on my truck as I drive around job site.  Everyone loves it!  It's very well made & the coloring is exquisite!  It arrived far faster than estimated and I just couldn't be happier!  It's a steal at this price point!  It is definitely 7"" so make sure the size it right for your needs.",Positive
I have gotten many compliments on my nose ring and I am very happy with the quality and design.,Positive

"They are just the size I wanted, tiny and so pretty......",Positive
Good product,Positive
"I received these as a birthday gift from my boyfriend and they are absolutely perfect. They're small and subtly while also being a little eye catching. The color green is gorgeous. They've been really comfortable, so much so I'm sleeping in them and typically my ears are so sensitive to jewelry I can only keep earrings in for a few hours. I am in love with these earrings.",Positive
"I use a large MAMBI Happy Planner and these fit perfectly. My house is always either clean and tidy or disorganized—and I hate having to clean everything at once. I like that the pages are double-sided and that I can simply, with the flip of a page, keep track each day of the house on a daily basis and incorporate zone cleaning.",Positive
Framed it and it looks fantastic,Positive
Couldn’t be happier with this,Positive
These earrings are delightful.  I wear them all the time!  Reminds me of elegant age - long gone.,Positive

"I love it!  We just moved overseas for a few years and we are looking forward to traveling the world.  Arrived in good condition, wrapped in bubble wrap.  It was a great addition to our hallway table!",Positive
Beautiful rings great quality. The only problem was I ordered them a little too big so I will have to take them to a jeweler to make smaller. I did call and leave a message With the owner regarding resizing and did not get a callback.  So when ordering make sure you know the exact ring size do not try to measure with a tape measure yourself that’s when I did it did not work out well.,Positive
My wife loved it. Nice quality.,Positive
I love the look of the letters and the colors. It fits my cup perfectly and i will definitely order again.,Positive
I love this! Got it for my hubs to remember the night we met,Positive

Awesome reminder! Looks awesome on my bedroom wall.,Positive
"I was looking at this purse and one of the reviews said ""just order it"".  It's a great purse for $60.00.  Very well made, sturdy, looks great, etc...  I've paid way too much for cheap purses in the past.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase.  There was even a nice little letter inside about it being a husband and wife that make them.  They are not made in some factory.  Great purchase!!",Positive
Loved the design and they fit perfectly. The prints were good quality and packaged well so they did not bend.,Positive
Item delivered in timely manor and was what i expected. Have not used item yet but has a nice smell,Positive

This was an anniversary gift for my husband who is a car guy. He loved it. I specified states that we have been to and the seller was very accommodating providing these specific states.  We even asked a question about one of the numbers and which state it was from. He replied quickly with an answer. They did a great job. Definitely recommend!,Positive
"Love love love! Thank you, it's perfect!",Positive
"Long lasting warm and cold drink, vibrant colors for the writing and so beautiful.<br />Unfortunately if it rips, it spills but overall a great little cup especially long drives.",Positive
"I was surprised by the weight and quality of this banner. Our daughter loved it and it matched the birthday party decor perfectly. It wasn’t pixelated or fuzzy or blurry in any way. The colors were bold, bright and clear. We were very pleased with our purchase!",Positive
Great quality,Positive
"Very pleased with seller, she personalize this bookmark with cats for a friend. Lovely and unique bookmark. I would love a bookmark with a bigger cat though",Positive
The necklace is beautiful! It's actually going to come off the chain and go on a safety pin so my husband can pin it to the inside of his (army) uniform. Pinecones are kind of our thing. I've spent a lot of time looking for the right one. (two and a half months actually). I love how realistic to looks! Fantastic job. From a very satisfied Army Wife.,Positive
I love the way these came out. The mediums are a little small and did not fit the male it was going to which was the only bad thing,Positive
Love the Quality and quick delivery,Positive
Good,Positive
"I'm an unemployed 16 year old, and I really wanted to get my mom a meaningful gift for Christmas, so I stumbled upon this, and I decided to add the $10 for 3 heart charms, and chose a gold finish and engrave my siblings and I's initials. It is absolutely adorable, and I can't wait to give her it. The chain was shorter than I expected, so if someone favors longer necklaces go for the chain longer than 17.5 because that's what I got, but I still think it's cute! I love it!! (In one of my photos I took it with the front facing camera so its backwards)",Positive
Works like a charm.,Positive
"I bought this for my daughter who just had her 29th birthday. The look on her face was priceless. She likes raw, natural elements, so this was absolutely perfect. She loved everything about it!!! It is a very dainty ring, and I just gave it to her, so I’ll review again on its quality once she’s had it for awhile. Very happy customer right now!!!",Positive
"Was pleasantly surprised. Nice quality, washed well. It is oversized, if you’re smaller than a 14 you will prob swim in it tho.",Positive

Great Job and THANK YOU!! xox",Positive

"Adorable earrings! I was so excited to wear my first pair today. I put the brown pair in right before I left the house today and noticed a little after an hour later they were both gone. Wish they would have put the clear stoppers on the backs of all the earrings to secure them, so they don’t fall out of your ears. Now my favorite pair is gone.

"They arrived early, and are exactly as I requested- one each of the hummingbird styles. The maker took time to cut the fabric so the birds are flying upright, too.<br />They're really cute- sturdy quilting cotton, with the nose wire & slider pocket on back to insert my filters. I chose the elastic loops instead of ties, my wear time is short periods. Maker used white elastic for the light material, and black for the dark material. I stuck a pen down inside the pocket of the dark one so you can see.<br />I'll wash these by hand, soak with laundry rinse disinfectant sanitizer, then hang dry (100% cotton WILL shrink in the heat of a dryer- who didn't know that?).<br />Very happy with my purchase!",Positive

All-in-all, these are nice to have around!",Positive

I bought this for my daughter who has earned an Associate Degree in Liberal Arts, a certificate in Automotive Technology and is one year from completing a Bachelor's degree! I bought this to let her know how proud we are of her achievements and her hard work!",Positive
The necklace is well made and the stones are rounded and not sharp.  It's easy to slip over the head since it's made with expandable elastic.  I'm purchasing a second one for my granddaughter.  It actually looks better in person than it shows on the web site photo.,Positive
This is a gorgeous tablecloth!  It is made so well and so pretty to look at.  The best part is that is never gets dirty!  you just wipe it away with a wet sponge!  Great Product,Positive

I'm decorating mine and my roommates home right now as the remodeling is finishing up and I saw this print on Amazon and thought it would definitely fit my room. I have always loved Edgar Allen Poe and this just fits with the direction I'm going with my own room. Great Quality and looks just like image on Amazon.,Positive
Love love love this necklace and have received  numerous compliments. It's heavy and as of now I believe is durable. I've worn it a few times within the last 2 month and have not seen any tarnish.,Positive
I thought this was a nice little pre Christmas gift to give my husband to always remember our first Christmas as a married couple. He agreed.,Positive
"The charm is surprisingly small.  I hate to take off more than one star for this, because after all it SHOULDN'T be too surprising since there are pictures of it right next to a ruler!  However, I own a similar violin pendant that I really love, which is the exact same length.  I had that in mind when ordering this.  But one thing you have to bear in mind for is the fact that a clarinet is little more than a thin cylindrical tube.  Due to the thinness of the design's width, it's going to feel a lot smaller than other charms of the same length.<br /><br />This is a nice quality pendant (although the chain is basically a throwaway).  But it might work better on a charm bracelet.  As a necklace pendant, people have to be leaning in pretty close to tell that it's a clarinet.",Positive
Very cute and simple idea; my boyfriend loved it.,Positive
We really like our personalized cruise door magnet!! It is very high quality and you will like it very much!!,Positive

"Item was ordered as a Valentine's Day gift. Carrier lost it but the seller did above and beyond to compensate - sent a second item quickly, and issued partial credit. Once the necklace arrived, it was better than I had hoped for - delicate, beautiful, pretty packaging, certificate of origination included, great design with two length options. Seller maintained contact while trying to locate the lost first package, and made sure that once received, the second one was as expected. I would highly recommend JEWEE, very reliable service.",Positive
Beautifully etched...really nice weight. I love it...highly recommend!,Positive
"I like the size of this bag!  It is nice and sturdy. My ipad fits very well in the front pocket. It does have a slightly unpleasant odor though. I'm not sure if it's because it's goat leather, but I'm not used to it.",Positive

"I've been a fan of the Dodge Ram for many, many years.  When I learned that Custom Car Posters was making a ram generations poster I had to get it!  I purchased the 24"" x 36"", with blue trucks, on satin paper.  You can see in the picture that it came out great!  The frame actually decreases the quality a bit, as the Target-brand frame I put it in is somewhat translucent rather than transparent.  The poster is sharper out of this frame.<br /><br />When I received the poster originally (I received it within a week, by the way -- don't be discouraged by the lead time quoted by Amazon) the box was unfortunately damaged in transit and the poster was badly crimped as a result.  The crew at Custom Car Posters immediately made me another one and shipped it with improved shipping materials.  They mentioned that USPS is generally very reliable, from a quality standpoint, in their experience.<br /><br />My box came with a thank-you card as well as a sheet of fun car stickers!  Too bad there weren't any Rams on the sticker, but, knowing this is a newer design for them it is not surprising that their existing stickers don't yet have the ram truck on them.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with the quality of the poster and the support experience I've had with CCP.",Positive
Love these little ear rings. I gave them as a graduation gift to a friend’s daughter. They are dainty and sparkly so they add a bit of fun to any outfit. They are pretty enough to wear with a dressy outfit as well. Great product and well made!,Positive

"My order was placed late in the evening. The next day it was made to my specifications and shipped!  I received it two days later!  How can they get a hand made product to me so fast?!<br /><br />I've been looking for a nice leather cover for my Moleskine Cahier notebook for some time. I wanted something simple and elegant without too much bulk. There are a few covers on the market but this one seemed most like what I wanted. The customization options were a bonus, I thought.<br /><br />My notebook cover arrived neatly wrapped in brown paper and string with a note thanking me for my order.  This cover is made of soft leather that's about 2mm thick with inside pockets that are made of 1mm leather. The feel reminds me of a good baseball glove, soft but sturdy.  The single row of stitching around the perimeter is consistent and neat. I can't tell where the maker started or ended.  The personalized lettering is deep and consistent. This product is much more attractive than the asking price reflects, and because it has custom features, it feels like I designed it!  It's mine!<br /><br />I was surprised to find that a genuine Moleskine Cahier lined notebook was installed in the cover already!  Those things are over $3USD making this an even better value!<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I can't recommend this maker enough!  Bravo!",Positive
"I received this as a gift. I loved the smell,  consistency, and packaging of the products so much that I came back to purchase a set for myself.",Positive
Better than I expected. Good work. Glad I waited for shipment to arrive. Took 10 days I think. I use iPhone Max. No problems so far.<br /><br />12/05/2020: now having switched over to 12 pro max I have to update my review. This case is not compatible with wireless charging. Description is  misleading,Positive
Exquisite ring! Wonderful customer service. I am so happy!,Positive

Unable to afford going to Salon since 2020, work full time & and too tired to have to do my nails couple times a week, so I’m thankful to find this. You will be happy with it too.",Positive

Upon receipt of it, I ordered 3 more pieces from the same artist and all have arrived and have made a stunning addition to our home. Additionally, during this process I had a need to contact the woman who made them and she was very helpful and extremely gracious. I can't think of enough words to describe how outstanding the craftsmanship is in each of these pieces. All, I can do is thank her.",Positive
"Gorgeous, delicate, and feminine -- it was a wonderful gift to myself!",Positive
"I was able to put licenses, insurance cards, a couple credit and bank cards, bills, and change in this wallet.  I was concerned I would not be able to use this because of size, wrong.  The leather is well stitched and embossed. The leather strap and pull are well done.  I have paid more for similar wallets and not look this nice or as functional.  I am beyond pleased with this product.",Positive
"I gave them as a gift to my Honey, along with the stocking cap. She likes them. She tells me they are good quality, warm and very soft. Nice stocking stuffers. I like that they are hand made. Handcrafted in Peru, 100% Superfine Alpaca. Not in China.",Positive

And just how many times have you burned your hands reaching for a bowl of oatmeal in the microwave?  It will never happen again using these lovely bowl holders.  The icing on the cake is they are machine washable.,Positive
"I gave 4stars because they are nice but the double face tape just doesn't work in a cold environment and there aren't holes drilled so you can screw it onto the house, therefore they are no longer on the house.  Otherwise they are the perfect size, were shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.",Positive

"The mat unrolls easily and stays flat. It is a good thickness and stays put on the table. It has a semi-matte finish that is easy on the eyes and keeps cards in place (my cards are not sleeved). I played a few games and it didn't help me beat the Minotaur, but the mat is good quality and recommended.  Definitely a good buy for long sessions. Note this is a solo mat.",Positive

Absolutely gorgeous! Looks as pictured.,Positive
"My teen son has always loved extra pressure on him and we wanted to try something other than a weighted blanket as they can get hot in the summer.  We put the sheet easily on the bed (easy if two people do it bc you have to lift the mattress ) and our son slept in the sheets and woke saying he loved them. He’s been using the sheet for about 2 weeks and yes, there are times he pops out of the sheet in his sleep but he still says he loves the sheet, so it’s a keeper !  Thanks to the creator of this gem!",Positive

"Amazing! Great Quality. It came on time, I ordered 4 at once, this is the only one that came when it was supposed to. It came in a yellow Amazon envelope with bubbles. Protected inside with a clear sleeve and a cardboard insert to keep it from bending. The dictionary page is legit, it is double sided and thankfully the image is on an even number...I have a bit of OCD, having to see the 915 would drive me nuts. lol. The image is crisp and I love it. I hope the person I got this for loves it too!<br />*Edit* I do want to add, I did have a little mishap. the clear sleeve it comes in has an adhesive flap, as I was taking the art out of the sleeve to put it into a frame the adhesive flap decided to make out with the top of the picture. It is literally a thing page from a dictionary, so I had to carefully pull them apart. Thankfully I was able to remove it without it ripping or damaging the picture....I held my breath and stuck my tongue out....it was terrifying, but I can't wait for my other orders to come in. I now know to flip the flap and stick it to itself before trying to remove...learn from my mishap!",Positive

"This sifter is great. It does a wonderful job seperating the mulch from the soil. Making the soil light and fluffy. Will be mixing in compost next to make a strong healthy home for my plants.<br />It was a bit smaller than I thought, but that is my fault for not paying attention to the measurements.",Positive

I took a chance on this one instead of going with the main one you see all over the internet due to the price and I am glad I did. The print quality and the custom design is second to none and I am very impressed with this. The other mainstream one is overpriced for what you get so I am very impressed with this. My girlfriend absolutely loved this and I can't speak enough about the quality of this product.,Positive
Just as described,Positive

"Anyone who says this isn't good quality construction is wrong.  It is thick sheet metal, and it is excellent quality.  My only issue is with the font they used for the letter ""G""  I  think it looks more like the lower case ""g"" myself.  My wife says it's fine, but I am a little more critical.  I would give this product 5 stars, if it were for the font.",Positive
So perfect for my sons birthday gift bags!!,Positive
"I am really impressed by the quality wow!!! Great package, the product was really well protected. It was a gift but i almost keep it for myself lol!!!<br />Try it, you will not be disappointed. 5 stars!",Positive

"very casual, wooden shape in lite teal color, matches pool area decor. Perfect!",Positive
"My son had played hockey for 13 years. I purchased the stick, helmet, skate & glove & put them in frames for Christmas. He loves them!",Positive
We received these as a gift along with a display tree from the same Inspired Traditions shop. The quality of these is fabulous. They are so durable that I don’t worry about my kids damaging them even though they are detailed and beautifully done. We enjoy doing them with the included guide as a family. It has become a meaningful and special tradition in our family at Christmas! They are truly works of art that we will enjoy for years to come.,Positive
I love it. I love it. I love it. It arrived sooner than expected and I loved the packaging. The ring came out beautifully. I'll cherish this forever as it was a gift to myself after losing my dog a day before New Year's Eve. Thank you for making it so lovely.,Positive
Unique reminder of a special day.,Positive
Nice print. Please note the print is a little larger than 8x10; you will need to trim it to fit a frame. I’ve got an eclectic grouping of prints and franes on the wall and this will be a good addition.,Positive
This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and nourished. I love the fact that it doesn't come in a plastic bottle. I will be using this and their shampoo from now on.,Positive
Love this necklace and works so well fit great and is so cute,Positive
"The earrings are beautiful, and the stones are lovely and well-matched.  They are large enough to be noticed, but still look sophisticated.  They have that moonstone look that is like a cloudy opal - not as blue as in the product photo, but more white as I expect moonstones to be - just what I wanted.  They are very nice, and the silver is excellent quality.  Also, they came double wrapped in plastic and placed inside a little plastic box.  The packaging protected them well.  They came very quickly.  Thank you!",Positive
This was a Chrismas present for my dad because he loves rhinos and he takes pride in his work. This card holder is sturdy and practical. Also it looks great on his desk! Glad I found this little gem!,Positive
fantastic! Thank you so much!!,Positive
Supercute,Positive
I am pleased with this and I only hope my elderly Aunt sees the humor in it as she drinks her nightly bourbob.,Positive
Real product. Great price. The chain is very well made so that is super nice.,Positive
The product is great. The customer service from the company is outstanding. The product came in with a mispelled name. They responded quicky and resolve the issue.<br />This product is well crafted and will look wonderful displayed in any home.,Positive
"Our friend was moving to Spain and we added these to the cupcakes. Completely unnecessary, but totally adorable. Everyone loved them.",Positive
My son absolutely loves these!! We put them up on his wall. We can't get over how cool they are!!! They were so easy for me to put up too.,Positive
Pictures look great in my son’s room! He loves them.,Positive
"I loved this necklace and the saying that came with it was perfect. We had a foster daugther many years ago who has grown up to a beautiful woman inside and out. We are much closer today than when she lived with us and I wanted something special for her on her wedding day. This was the gift I chose and she loved it.  Although I couldn't give it to her before she was getting ready on her big day and I wasn't sure if she had a different necklace picked out to wear,  she said she wanted to wear this necklace and it made my heart soar.",Positive
Got two of these as a “little something” for my anniversary with my husband. They’re beautifully made! The engraving is perfect and doesn’t wear away. We haven’t taken them off one time in two months and the chains haven’t broken. Definitely worth the money :),Positive
awesome prints. Walmart sells perfect fit frames for like $2.,Positive
"I was expecting a cheap piece of plastic, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite hefty and solidly built.<br /><br />Depending on your door, you may have to get creative in order to install it. I can tell you right now that a few strips of double sided foam tape are strong enough to hold it up.<br /><br />Looks cool, and since your guests might not notice until they're leaving your place, it's a nice surprise right before they go home. Awesome gift idea!",Positive
Very special ...,Positive
I absolutely love this bracelet. I wear it almost daily.,Positive
This soap pump is beautiful! I bought it in bright white with a stainless top and it is perfect in my kitchen. The distressing adds character and will only allow the pump to age well. Thank you for this customizable piece!,Positive
Love it! Well made!!,Positive
"This cover is so well made! It fits snugly over the Bumbo seat and stays put when you lift your little one out. It is also incredibly soft, and the fabric design is adorable!",Positive
So cute but made out of a Dollat Tree towel and potholder,Positive
"This was lighter than I was expecting just based on the picture (lol) but it's sturdy enough to hold up a couple large dog harnesses and collars. It looks nice on the wall, so it's one of those cute AND functional decorations.<br />Disclaimer: I have not hung anything that heavy on this (more than 5 lbs.).",Positive
"Got this necklace for my mom as a mother’s Day gift and she loved it! Very beautiful, sturdy, and exactly as expected. Delivered earlier than planned which is always a bonus.",Positive
Seems to be sturdy enough yet looks nice.<br />Perfect size for my drink with ice.<br />Cute designs of cat that my grand daughters loved.,Positive

"Came on time, very nice gift rap.",Positive
"nice print, but size was hard to frame perfectly, lost part of weather vane in standard frame in my chosen size. maybe in smaller print would fit  better.",Positive
"Way smaller than picture depicts, should've read the description but there was no option to change the size so I assumed it would be that size. Hopefully it sticks well it's a Christmas present.",Positive
They are very nice for the price,Positive
Love these earrings and I get so many compliments EVERY time I wear them! So glad I found them!,Positive
"Have purchased 4 so far and each has been well made, delivered promptly and sized right. Have given these as gifts with coordinating teapots.  The price is reasonable compared to other cozies that are $7.00 more and require almost $10.00 additional to ship. (you can purchase the teapot with your savings)  I love that they are handmade here in the USA.",Positive
"What a great gift for any nature lover, my friend loved her gift.",Positive
"For any Gilmore Girl fan, The Life and Death Brigade and their motto &#34;In Omnia Paratus&#34; (ready for all things) was a key point in Rory's life.  I wear this on my right ring finger and when I look at it, I smile. I am reminded of one of my fave Rory episodes and in turn, I feel uplifted. Sturdy, yet weightless when worn, the ring is well made. A great value, it shipped quickly and it's a must for any G.G. fan!",Positive
"I had gotten this for my father in law for Christmas. Honestly I was reall worried about the quality, but he loves his Harley's. Once he opened it, he lost it because they were so beautiful.... The quality of the photos were A Lot better than expected and i highly recommend these",Positive
"The sign was very nice only suggestion the packaging came in a envelope, since it’s metal was a little bend. My husband straightened it out before we hang it in our screened in porch.",Positive
I love this bracelet! It exceeded my expectations by far. It is the perfect fit for my 2 month old. I will be reordering another one when he outgrow this one!,Positive
Great anniversary gift for my friends. They loved it,Positive
The pictures were great.  Love the vintage look of the paper and design.  We LOVE Disney so its a great tribute to Disney and what a magical place it is.  Thank you!,Positive
"I was looking for a small hoop for my cartilage and had been having a difficult time finding something that would work the way I wanted. I took a chance on these because they seemed to measure how I wanted. Once I got it in, I was so happy. They cover the ear just the way I wanted and look good and dainty just as I was hoping.",Positive
"I didn't know there was a product like this till I saw it highlighted in an Amazon list of items from artists in different states. I looked under Tennessee, my state, out of curiosity and saw this. I have a flat top range which has wear and tear, it works fine, but the top just didn't look great. This is the perfect solution, plus it gives a little more work space without the risk of further damaging the range top. The color is beautiful. I absolutely love it.",Positive
I can't say enough about this touching bracelet.<br />It's a wonderful memorial.<br />Many thanks for the customized engraving,Positive
Ordered these for a much needed Girls trip this winter.  They are perfect for the gift bags I am creating!  Thanks!,Positive
Great quality. I’d like to see size 1 as well,Positive
This is a beautiful necklace! Gorgeous blue color and good quality! Very nice and great gift item!,Positive

"We absolutely love our sign. Puts a personal touch on our home. The quality of the sign is great and has kept it's color through rain and winds and lots of sun and heat,  really a great sign!",Positive
Awesome personalization!!!,Positive
"My husband and I absolutely loved it, I got him the wooded box with his initials on both the wallet and the box and they are beautiful. I was expecting it here by mid June and It arrived earlier. The quality of the wallet is excellent",Positive
"I am so impressed and in love with this personalized gift for my partner of 1 year. I think I totally nailed it by choosing this for the traditional first anniversary gift of paper. It is so perfect in its simplicity.<br /><br />You can choose any city for the map no matter how remote and unknown it may be. The city location is centered perfectly within the heart so one definitely knows to which special location is being referred. The shadow box frame is an absolutely gorgeous final touch to the piece.<br /><br />Some reviews I've read are from customers that have claimed this is a piece they could have made themselves; if so, I wonder why they wasted their time complaining about this fact in their reviews if they knew that. They must have a lot of extra time on their hands. Even if I could and wanted to take the time out of my busy schedule to do this myself, the price is totally worth it because Define Design 11 sells EXCELLENT and EXCEPTIONAL customer service. To me, the level of customer service is one of the most important aspects of a company and Define Design 11 delivers in spades. They are so prompt with responding to inquiries and happily accommodating customer requests.<br /><br />I highly recommend Define Design 11 if you want the perfect gift created for your loved one. I know my partner and I will treasure this piece for the rest of this life.",Positive

"I got this for our 5 year anniversary. I love astronomy and this was such an amazing way to personalize a date. My fiancé loves it and every-time he sees it, he comments on how great this idea is. Thank you for such a great, high quality product! We’ll for sure be ordering another for our next milestone :)",Positive
Its has a nice fruity floral smell and i don’t usually like fruity/floral.,Positive
"For 40.00 I did expect a little bit larger bottles, I have long hair almost to my butt and I use a lot of shampoo and conditioner when I wash my hair, and the bottles are smaller than I expectd, but that being said it is a cleansing shampoo. It did make my hair soft and it did not tangle, which for me is a plus.<br /><br />There is tea tree oil in it and boy that smell is stong. It is not a bad smell but wow that tes tree oil comes out and overpowers the other scents in the shampoo, it is not as strong in the conditioner. The tea tree oil does tingle your scalp which was unexpected but nice, it is almost like cooling, but when I rinsed it out I could tellthe difference, it did get the build up out of my hair and the conditioner made it soft and easy to comb through.<br /><br />I am very pleased so far.",Positive

"I searched for real copper for our 7th anniversary. When I came upon this i liked the fact I could chat through text message with the creator directly. Shipping was quick, on time and hassle free. I like to buy US products when possible and this was, what feel was a fantastic deal! I can clearly see the passion of the creator in this work of art. I recommend RefreshingArt.com to everyone.<br />Any photo I take wouldn't do it the justice it deserves. Image is stock from amazon",Positive

I liked the gift I ordered. It was what I expected.,Positive
Love Love Love it!! We bought the decal with the wing attachments to the ends and it looks fabulous in our new nursery!! It is large so I needed my husbands help to put it up because we did not want any bubbles when we stuck it to the wall. This is a wonderful decal and for the money I could not complain because I wanted something that when the baby is bigger and wants to change the room it would be an easy change.,Positive
Absolutely perfect! Hanging in my master bath!,Positive
Daughter present,Positive
Nice gift. Personalized with initials. Good quality leather and fits the checkbook perfectly.,Positive
I bought this card for a Taylor Swift loving friend and was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the card! The paper is a smooth cardstock that is sturdy and didn't bend when in the gift bag.

"I bought two of these, one gray and one black. The gray is very light, almost white, which I didn’t expect or I’d have gotten two black. But, these are gorgeous! They arrived quickly and feel good quality. Packaged tightly to avoid damage. I already have both my boys’ pictures in them, and they look fantastic! Would definitely recommend!",Positive
"This was a great product to make personalized ornaments for our tree. I’m not crafty, so I was really excited to find this product to make me LOOK like I was. The chalkboard ornament (purchased separately) was a perfect surface to apply the vinyl to because it was a little rough.",Positive

"Now that I have a fob to keep in my pocket, I needed a more flexible key chain.  This does double duty by folding up yet being available to go over the wrist.  Of course, my favorite beagle always makes me smile!!",Positive
The bracelet is beautiful! I loved it. The material is good quality. The packaging was great as well. Only thing I would change is maybe the string being a little thicker still very pretty. Thank you!,Positive
Will change from 4 to 5 rating as soon as I wear them. But the size and color is exactly what I wanted. I have a lot of hair and it is hard to see earrings even tho I have short hair.  But so far I am happy with these earrings.,Positive

I got this as a gag gift for my mom because she loves Post Malone. It was really good until the freshener decided to split into two pieces I’m not sure if that was manufacturing or what quality. It still smells good. My mom also really loved this so if your mom likes Post Malone this is the perfect gift lol.,Positive
The delivery of this item was timely and so far the quality of the product has been great.  Plan on buying more.,Positive

So cute and exactly what I wanted. I ordered one for myself and one for a friend and the packaging is super cute!,Positive
"As a native Cajun, it is important to keep our heritage alive. Our language is dying, as well as our culture.  The parties we attended as young children are vastly different than the ones we had in the 60’s & 70’s.  My own children are no longer taught French in school.  I learned from kindergarten on up as well as at home.  Our everyday patois is being lost and that breaks my heart. So it is up to us to keep our own traditions alive.  And that begins with our food.",Positive
"This was a surprise for my husband, celebrating our 50th Anniversary!",Positive
"It took 2 weeks to get, but worth the wait.",Positive

Very pretty earrings. Not heavy.,Positive
"This dainty necklace with three pale jade beads is a wonderful everyday piece and a really great gift idea. I got this for myself, but it would make a really beautiful gift for a friend, sister, daughter, etc. because the presentation is wonderful. The necklace comes on a standard board, but it is encased inside a 3D display frame and comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth and a cute ""Thank You"" note with ""To"" and ""From"" printed on the inside. The necklace in its frame would look amazing in a gift basket. The card also has useful information such as cleaning and care for the jade and the silver, e.g., keep it away from pools, hot tubs, perfumes, and sunscreen; store it in an airtight ziplock; do not overpolish.<br />On me, the necklace FITS like a loose choker at its tightest, which is perfect for the office, and it has ~2"" of extra chain for a looser fit.<br />The only CON is that the closure is one of the smallest I've seen, and it may be difficult for people with dexterity issues.",Positive
Exactly as described. Great quality,Positive
"I love this necklace - it’s so pretty and dainty.  Looks great with anything I wear, and it’s a constant reminder of a little hummingbird who visits me in my yard.",Positive
Chloe has a heart condition and needs low sodium treats. She polished off the first bag in two weeks. I ordered the three variety bag next. They are a little pricey but worth it.,Positive

Amazing craftsmanship and price. Delivery came quickly. This made me so happy to use at our wedding and will last a long time. Thank you.,Positive
This garland is very lovely! I used it around my big garden bathtub that is beach themed. I love that it was from a small business.  I was very happy with how quickly it arrived.,Positive

"I really like the headband and I wear it quite often, however, each strand could be wider/thicker - it sort of blends in and gets lost when I wear braids/twists. And the headband size is a bit big.<br /><br />I have an average size head and I have to adjust the headband to rest on my forehead a particular way because if I just place it on, it will fall off.<br /><br />I understand that for health and comfortability, the headband cannot be too tight but the elastics in back should help stretch out the headband if needed.",Positive
"I absolutely love this sign! I origionally bought this sign to go with my 1 year old son’s birthday theme (didn’t really think about using it afterwards) but it’s so perfect that it will go right into his room on display after the party.

"This is great, the beads have stayed in place for MONTHS and the product doesn’t irritate me or change colors. Idc as much that I had to pinch it a little inwards to create my own little stopper mechanism (because there wasn’t a sturdy placement, the beads moved all over from hole to inside of my nose etc). Regardless, I’m here for it.",Positive

"The Mudhorn Vinyl decals arrived today.  I was impressed!  I went right out and applied them to the Givi windscreen on my Royal Enfield 650cc Interceptor.  I put them on the windscreen.  At first, I was worry about applying them without bumps, but I found the decals ""forgiving"" and I could carefully lift and reposition.  It is in the 30*Fs in the garage today.  The decal on the left would not stick to the plexiglass, so I got a hair dryer and lightly warmed the back of the holding material to warm it up.  Then it stuck nicely.  I did use a credit card to smooth the decal and then rubbed with a soft cotton cloth.  Everything I hoped for and goes well with my Mascot ""Baby Yoda"" who usually sits on the tail carrier of my bike.<br />I recommend these decals for your windscreen!",Positive
I ordered these for my wife. We wondered how she would look with a nose ring and now we know! The rings fit well and don't fall out easily. Nice that there are several colors. So now she can have a nose ring or an extra earring without having the piercing. The rings seem to be  good quality items. Well worth it.,Positive

"I have purchased over 40 frames by carved by heart and can assure you they are top quality. In my opinion the chips fit better than they do in the overpriced Harley frames. I get all kinds of compliments on these frames and will continue to buy them as they are that good.<br /><br />As for the person who rated these a two, it is your own fault you cannot read when it clearly says there is no frame included. Why would you give them a 2 because you cannot read?",Positive
"These Emoji Wine Charms are fantastic! The seller is every talented as quick! I had the item in my hand way before I was supposed to. They are packaged nicely in a box and ready for gifting and/or storage (whatever you choose). They are so cute! They automatically bring a smile to your face. Each friend can have their own emoji charm that fits their personality. They are a great conversation piece. They are very well made. They feel like a mini button with very strong magnets. Each charm has a magnet, and you fasten it to the glass by aligning another magnet inside of the glass. Put it near the top so it won't be in the wine. I don't see them falling off or sliding down. This magnets are super strength and once aligned they aren't going anywhere. I struggled with the magnets getting stuck inside the back button portion, but a piece of flatware will fix that. Once you pry it a bit it sticks to the knife (or fork or spoon). These are a perfect gift for the person in your life that has wine parties, even if that person is you. 😜<br /> I hope you have found this review helpful to you.

I was very happy my decal came right on time and there was a hand written note inside thanking me for my purchase. That was so sweet! Super happy with this purchase and my son loves it!,Positive

"When I married my wife years ago, she taught me very quickly that quality often outweighs quantity. Since then, I've developed a bit of a taste for all things quality. This my friends, is a quality leather envelope/wallet. When I first removed the product from the box, there was a little oil soaked into the lid, but that never deterred me. Being a newly made, full grain leather product, you would expect a bit of the oil to still be on the surface. Press it against an ultra dry cardboard lid for the duration of shipping and of course you're going to get some oil spots. DON'T LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU. When I first put cash in the larger pocket, it was a little too tight for my comfort, so I started twisting, bending, rolling, and distressing the leather to stretch it out. After a few minutes of work, the leather stretched and the cash fits perfectly. The stitching is also a great indication of quality. It's thick and strong compared to other leather wallets that I've had in the past that have worn out and split within weeks of purchasing. No splitting with these threads. I recommend it and will probably purchase another.",Positive
Great product which will be perfect for my daughter’s wedding! Arrived quickly in perfect condition and was exactly as depicted in picture!,Positive
"I'm going to order another one, so happy they have a few more to choose from!! Beautiful and inspiring!!",Positive

"Absolutely thrilled with this handmade hammered cuff ring Auralee made for me. Beautiful attention to detail and quality of craftsmanship! I messaged Auralee several times before placing the order and requested several customizations - she easily and precisely made every alteration exactly as I specified even down to an 1/8 inch! It fits my middle finger perfectly at size 8.5 and is very comfortable, being finished smoothly with no rough edges whatsoever.<br /><br />Auralee was VERY prompt, professional and personal in every detail of her communication and the transaction! She even included a sweet, handwritten message with the piece. Can’t say how impressed I am with this artist and how happy I am with this ring!!!<br /><br />Cheers and many thanks, Auralee!",Positive
"I can’t say enough about how well made this is. My husband and I were happily surprised at the quality. We chose navy blue and it is beautiful. We have 3 goldens so our house is already filled with “golden” items - this however, is our favorite.<br />I love how it mounts off the wall!<br /><br />Only wish it came much bigger!! This is the 16” size.",Positive

"Wanted to show people behind me I'm losing life. Super quick delivery, not bad price and installed easy enough!! My only issue (MY FAULT!!!) Is that all 3 pieces come on one sheet. As u can see it curves down cause I adhered it all at once and to keep from crinkles just kept going. CUT THEM SO CAN APPLY PIECE BY PIECE w rubbing alcohol and a CC! Cool thing is ordered another so will remove one or 2 but means I get more life!",Positive
"As best I can tell, the necklace did indeed contain authentic Moldavite.  I've got a fairly good eye there, but am not a gemologist. :)  Fake Moldavite is common, so having a source you can trust is important.<br /><br />The wire 'cage' of the pendant is nicely made (artistic and sturdy) and holds the stones securely as well.<br /><br />The only SMALL knock I have is that the cord the pendant came with is so short it barely fits around my neck.",Positive
Love this shirt! The perfect Groundhog Day shirt.,Positive
I love this so much. It was given as a gift to my daughter who wears it every day.,Positive

"Gorgeous, beautiful and perfectly made!  I fell in love with this wreath when I saw it on Amazon and was thrilled when I received it. This wreath will take your breath away. It is so pretty!  I can’t tell you how many compliments I received during the Christmas holidays. Most people stayed outside in the cold to talk about how elegant it looked on my front door. I kept telling them, come inside and let’s talk but they were too busy feeling, touching and looking at my wreath. My neighbors wanted to know where I got it from because it was certainly well made. The wreath came in a well constructed box that can be used as a storage box. This is and will be my lifetime wreath. It is too lovely not to be anything less!",Positive
"The bracelet is perfect and the seller was very helpful! Also, I received the item earlier than the delivery date!",Positive

"Kids loved playing it. If you look at the stuff that's going on on the board itself you'll probably laugh and question it at the same time. There's a character that's urinating on Stonehenge, another character that's watering a pot garden, another that's appears to be tripping on mushrooms, a group that's playing spin the bottle, etc. Sturdy built, but I'm just curious who designed this thing. Not suitable for children with the drug references.",Positive
Perfect size and the quality was good considering the price.,Positive
Love it.,Positive
"Found these by accident when looking for level back earrings— sick of losing clasps and keepers— live the colors— I bought one pair in every color and they are great. Love the history, quality and they are the perfect size. I wish they had more shades to buy now.",Positive
"I’m about four months along in my loc journey with microlocs and I needed something besides just plain water to give my hair an uplift in the morning. Well this is it! The smell is great. Not overpowering at all. After it dries I can catch a light scent of the peppermint but that’s cool, I like it. Most importantly it wakes my hair up after being in a bonnet all night long and leaves me with soft moisturized locs and a fresh scalp. The bottle has lasted about a month with using it twice daily. Overall I say this is an awesome product if you want something that is natural, smells good and doesn’t leave residue or build up. Just added a new bottle to my cart today.",Positive
I am all about flamingos and these are a quality product. Good purchase for the money.,Positive
These are fabulous. Quick turnaround and very high quality. I love mine!!,Positive

"These are my third order, I think they’re a great gift.  Took less than two weeks to receive them and I am very happy. I’ll definitely be back.",Positive
I love this so much. It smells absolutely amazing. Will be buying again. Hopefully will always be available.,Positive
I bought several of these as stocking stuffers .. and some for me too. Peppermint is my favorite and this is a great scent. They smell great but they are not overpowering. Just clean and fragrant - leaves your hands clean and soft!,Positive

"These came super fast and are printed on thick paper, with a semi-gloss type coating to protect them. They fit perfectly in a normal 8x11 frame. The coloring is very nice and makes them look ""older"" but with clearly printed typing. I used them in a half bath that has black fixtures with black and gold granite counters. Great value!",Positive

"[[VIDEOID:91f34d3d27823ab495ef0a8c87105276]] I bought this product out of desperation and I could not have been more pleased with the outcome. Although I wash my hair routinely, I could not get the lint and product buildup out no matter how hard I tried. 3 years into my journey, I have never had a detox. This product comes with simple instructions and smells AMAZING. I had a severe situation, so I did two 30 min soaks to completely rid my hair of the issue. After one soak, it was nearly all-gone. The product left my hair soft. I will be purchasing extra bags for down the line!",Positive
"I contacted the artist about getting a custom pendant for my daughter. She was very patient and diligent about making sure that I got the exact pendant that I wanted.<br /><br />When I received it, it was packaged very well. I got it MUCH earlier than expected.<br /><br />The pendant itself is actually two parts that are meant to be worn together “charm necklace” style. The size and weight were as described. They both have a nice weight and feel very substantial; I think they will last several lifetimes and hopefully will become a family heirloom to be passed down through many generations!<br /><br />The included chain was perfect for the pendants. And the patina on both the necklace and pendants are gorgeous!<br /><br />The flowers I chose were Forget-Me-Not and Dandelion seed in the oval pendant, and mustard seed in the round pendant. The color of the Forget-Me-Not was vibrant and paired very well with the Dandelion seed. The movement of the mustard seed inside the small round pendant was something that I didn’t think would matter much, but (luckily) I deferred to the artists knowledge of her materials and the movement of it just served to bring even more life to an already magnificent piece!<br /><br />Contina, thank you a million times over for the beautiful pendant arrangement!!! I know my daughter will love it!!! And I know your shop will be the first place I shop for all of my jewelry from now on!<br /><br />I will definitely be recommending you to all my friends!",Positive

This arrived well ahead of the estimated time.  It will look great on her new Littman stethoscope. I highly recommend this product and seller.",Positive
I have purchased 5 of these from this vendor and have always been pleased with the product. People are always asking where I got my yeti handle.,Positive
Everything about it was amazing. Only downside is the chain snags clothes abs it’s hard to get out of the chain. Other than that it’s wonderful. Boyfriend loved this gift.,Positive
Another perfect gift!,Positive
Our son loves this! The engraving and shipping was very fast and it looks great!,Positive
The necklace is beautiful and exactly as pictured. I can’t wait to give it to my granddaughter for her birthday.,Positive

This was much smaller than I anticipated when I was purchasing.,Positive
"Love it, and it goes perfectly with my decor.",Positive
"Initially i was a bit concerned because of how inexpensive this was , but i am blown away ! it’s high quality and the engravings are crisp . I thought there might have been a compromise in the ease of reading the font (i got the smallest size tag) , but it’s perfect . Not to mention it is far more customizable than other tags . 11 out of 10 , def recommend 😎👍",Positive
Beautiful good quality,Positive
This was a gift. She is currently wearing it. She wanted a stud that had a short post for her tragus piercing.  She feels it is the right fit length wise to still clean her ear out.,Positive
Love them!,Positive
Well made and easy to use. I opted for this more expensive product after reading reviews on the cast iron models. Definitely recommend.,Positive
I have this as a gift to my friend.  She loved it!,Positive
I got theses as bridesmaid gifts for my sisters. I have only given one to one sister but she loves it. I would recommend it!,Positive
Absolutely beautiful. We opted to have this monogram and was pleasantly surprised at the turn around time!  This would be a special graduation gift for your son or a great groomsman gift!,Positive
Great quality! It comes exactly like it’s described!,Positive
"Take note: It is only painted with white dots edging the wings on one side so there’s really only one best way to hang it and that is with the butterfly looking to the right. Also, there were NO hooks/clasps on either end of the black chain to hang it onto the suction cup hook or to hook the chain onto the butterfly. All my other sun catchers came with these hooks. I really like it and hope the sender can provide two small clasps so it hangs properly. How do I contact the sender?",Positive
It fits well in with our decor and it’s just want I wanted to fill a space. Very sturdy as well. I would recommend it.,Positive
Love it.  Will frame and add to my champagne wall,Positive
Super cute poster. I put it in a grey frame with a white matt and it turned out beautifully.,Positive
It was everything‼️,Positive
"I get so many compliments on these little guys! I love them. Gives the room much personality. Would buy again and make for a great gift to a space loving nerd or really anyone they're so cute. The quality of each print is great and I think they would do great without frames, but I like mine framed and they will last longer. Would buy again.",Positive
"We modified the rules for the 3 and 5 year old, but everyone loved playing this game.  I was surprised how much.",Positive

"I absolutely love this soap. I’ve always been a user of doterra bar soap for years. I just needed a change. I wanted something that make my skin not so dry and something without all the nasty stuff in it. Well this has surpassed my expectations greatly. It makes my skin feel amazing and I can smell the wonderful scent on my skin all day!!! I’ve found my new soap, will definitely be purchasing again. My whole family loves the soap too, so big win. Buy it now, you’ll be happy you did.",Positive

It was better than I expected. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend!,Positive
Very nice. I got it in no time. Light weight so it won’t weigh the cake down. But not flimsy material either. It is acrylic material ( like a hard plastic).,Positive
"It didn't look like real wood like it does in the picture  I should have read reviews or paid more attention to the details I'm not saying that I didn't like it,it was ok for the price",Positive
I don’t have enough good things to say about these wood letters! They were such a good deal! They shipped so fast! They were packaged so nice! And they’re exactly what I wanted! 10 stars!,Positive
This sea glass necklace is a beautiful cobalt blue!  Have received many compliments on it!,Positive
My son loves it!,Positive
Absolutely beautiful!  Eacally<br />What I wanted!,Positive
"The color of these jade earrings is just mesmerizing... and very calming. The look of the earrings while on is very mystical and beautiful, to me. The description states you have to wear them continuously to get any health properties from them. But even if there are no health benefits, their beauty is enough. The gold earring backs provided are extremely small, so it's great the silicone pairs are also included. You will feel a little mystery about yourself when wearing these pretty jade studs. Simple and classy!",Positive
This is a gorgeous bracelet with smaller gemstones so it’s great if you’re a female and if you have smaller wrists.<br />it was also packaged beautifully!!,Positive
Necklace is nice and well put together. No complaints so far on that. The free gift it comes with is a different story as it came with a crooked topping and covered in excess glue. All in all still 5 stars bc the necklace itself is great and the free gift is just that.,Positive
I got the smallest bracelet and fit her beautifully.  She is only 6 lbs 9 oz right now but can wear it for a couple more months I believe.  I couldn't see the name Everleigh very well on the bracelet because it's so tiny.,Positive
Exactly as described.  Fun to personalize!,Positive
Perfect size and great true red color,Positive
I liked it because it was a unique gift.,Positive
Beautiful,Positive
Great quality! Super fast shipping. It made my sister bachelorette celebration special.,Positive
Any trump fan or not would love this card! Came faster than what was expected and really well made.,Positive
"It was beautiful, we loved it!",Positive
"I'm an assistant principal, and our school is the sharks. I love it for my office, and I'll order more for my colleagues.",Positive
Very beautiful and delicate. Package was very nice.,Positive
"What a fun and cute gift for friends or a couple. The stones are of decent quality, and the price was great! The magnets on each of the bracelets is such a sweet idea, and really does work!",Positive
"I love the personalization and the unique feel that comes with the stitching.<br />Gave to my husband as a gift on our wedding day.<br />Luckily he had it in his pocket during the ceremony, I was have a giggle fit the entire time & my nose started running... he was right there with it to let me dry my giggle tears",Positive
"Well made. Fits nicely, neither too tight or too loose.",Positive
I was extremely impressed with the quality of this sign! I love it so much!,Positive
"I love the horns! I was even more excited that they arrived a week earlier than expected so I could wear them to the renfair this weekend!<br />They look real, light weight so they don't hurt to wear.  I am happy with them thank you 😊",Positive
I am using it outdoors although I’m not sure it is not designed for that. Hope it holds up but it is beautiful.,Positive
Pretty and delicate beaded bracelet! Beautifully packaged and prompt shipping. Thanks so much!,Positive
Just what I wanted for son’s bathroom,Positive
They look great!,Positive
Sometimes we need a little reminder that we have everything we need.,Positive
"This is not a mass-produced item (it's made by a couple per their note with my bag) and the quality is incredible. I've wanted a messenger bag like this for years and I'm so happy with the purchase. I think the strap is a nice length, though I had to get it on the last loop because I'm a little on the tall side, but I like where the purse hangs.<br /><br />Thank you for shipping this so quickly--I was expecting it a week later than I received it.",Positive
These are beautiful! I didn’t realize they didn’t come with frames but that was ok I did have to cut the sides to fit them into the frames I bought but it was just the white around the edges. They are just what I wanted and a great compliment to the room.,Positive
"I love the tree of life theme and abalone, these were perfect. Not too heavy. I have received multiple compliments. I would definitely but other pieces from them.",Positive
I love it! I have a small wrist almost like a child though my hand is much bigger. Lol I can get it on not worrying about it coming off. It is exactly as described. Elegantly made in my opinion!<br /><br />My wrist is 6 in in diameter and the biggest part of my hand is almost 9 inches and the bracelet is about 9 inches in diameter. I had a little hard time wrapping the measuring tape but I think it got it pretty close!<br /><br />Love my 🎻 bracelet! Thank you!,Positive
So cute and good quality,Positive
I love it!!!! I purchased frames from Walmart for $1.93 each and hung them with medium command strips!!!! They're a little uneven cause I was too excited to wait for my husband to hang them... but they are perfect in my eyes 🥰,Positive
As described. Big.,Positive
love love love,Positive
Love it!,Positive
Fanstastic quality,Positive
I got this in aluminum and love it.  It is 5/8ths inch wide and the Runes are very clear.  It doesn't aggravate the ear either once you are used to it.  Definitely recommend.,Positive
Very nice,Positive
Arrived faster than expected.  I love it.  Can’t wait to gift this to my mom,Positive
I absolutely love this display case! I love that it is compact and doesn't take up a lot room on my end table. My  only problem is that I ran out of room... too many mini figures :/ I need about 2 more rows I think. But for the price excellent. I love that its handmade. The craftsmanship is very clean and is customizable. I just got bare wood (because I am an artist and wish to paint it myself) but its quality and arrived pretty quick. :),Positive
great,Positive
Good quality and great customer service.,Positive
Great quality and nice keepsake for my grandson's first Christmas,Positive
"I really like the earring & wear them a lot, just thought they'd be a little bit larger.",Positive
"Fits perfect, looks just like the picture and I love it!!",Positive
Beautiful and looks great!,Positive
"They are very thin, but gave the look I wanted. I probably should have gone in a different color. This was the shimmer gold. Not really shimmery.",Positive
"Easy to use. I attempted with a stencil brush vs roller and nothing bled through. Use minimal paint and it will come out amazing! I received 2 large stencils that cut my normal project time in half. In comparison to others I’ve used previously, the value is definitely there.",Positive
My mother cried and I mean bawled her eyes out with happiness!!! Do it! Comes protected in a thick cardboard envelope also!!,Positive
"I gifted myself and two of my sister/friends this combo. They absolutely loved it ! The combination of stones is beautiful!  They represent mindfulness, uniqueness ,and sisterhood for us! Very versatile and colorful!",Positive
"They look great in the frames i got! Love them, they were exactly what I wanted for the walls of our nursery.",Positive
"I really love this Lei, however the year says 2022 and I searched up 2023 graduation leis..  Make sure you are paying attention to the year on your graduation gifts so they are the right ones.. Seems when you search the year you need, the previous year always populates first.  I was so excited ordering things for my daughter, I failed to make sure I paid attention to the grad year on the product.. I did send a message to the seller so I'm hoping I can at least get a replacement for the year and can add it myself but it was truly my mistake of not paying attention to details.. The lei itself is beautifully made and the colors are spot on!  I would recommend this purchase!<br /><br />UPDATE:  The seller was wonderful with communication and sent me the 2023 year with no additional charge even though it was my mistake!  Wonderful to work with!  I will order from this seller again in the future!!",Positive
Great.,Positive
Bigger than expected (good thing) cute sign!!,Positive
Adorable and glad they added colors now,Positive
love it,Positive
 ,Positive
"The decal is perfect! Exactly as pictured! The high school graduate, who I purchased this for, is going to LOVE it. Thank you!",Positive
Literally the cutest thing ever,Positive
Its small good for a keychain. 3d printed so I'm sure who ever made it had a good plan for it. No complaints. The keychain side is a good strong hold onto the 3d print. Loud but because of the size the pitch is high.<br />Needs a sanding or somekind of smoothing out.,Positive
This bracelet was beautifully made and the quality of the stones is amazing! I am so in love!,Positive
"Amazing print, expertly mounted and ready to hang.  Hanging hardware included!  Beautiful, vivid colors, life-like silhouettes.  Top quality in every way. Highly recommend.",Positive

Honestly such a beautiful ring. It looks better than I expected and even cam with the cutest little box,Positive
"I am in love with my Oddish Planter, and it's impressive to those who see it. I picked this design because it had the eyes and face colored in, which takes it to the next level. Also supporting a small company is great too!",Positive
"I absolutely love this! I ordered it to make frogs and turtles out of polymer for fairy gardens. Shipping was extremely fast! This mold is so thick and sturdy! I just started playing with it this morning, and one thing I really loved was that since it’s clear, you can see if you have any hollow areas in your impressions before you end up taking them out, and then have to re-do them! I love the detail on the turtles and frogs too! I’m thinking that due to the bending back and forth (gravity is definitely your friend getting these little guys out! But it’s very easy!) I definitely won’t try doing all 4 at once again as it resulted in warping the 2 turtles. Nothing at all wrong with the design, but I am guessing just a learning experience. I still ended up getting beautiful frogs and turtles and at a fraction of the price. They’re so quick and easy to do! I would absolutely recommend this product and this seller! They even threw in an adorable acorn mold with my order.",Positive
"I've been looking for a sturdy, medium size leather bag for quite some time. This one is just what I was looking for. It's simple and good quality, The stitching, and lining look like they will hold up to a lot of wear and tear. Great product!",Positive
"Great quality, look and fit!  Superb stone and setting!",Positive
I like the slightly rustic look.,Positive
Worked perfectly used for wedding,Positive
Absolutely beautiful and delicate necklace. I was also surprised at how beautifully it was wrapped and the fact that there was a pair of earrings as a gift to me. Such a beautiful touch to take care of customers like that. I recommend you to all of my friends. Thank you so much Deniz. 🙏🌺,Positive
"Brought it for my wife’s birthday, she loves it, good quality necklace.<br />Most important is my wife and daughter love it",Positive
"These are beautiful, and from what I remember (I have sent most of them already!) they most (or all?) have prayers on the back.  The artwork is so detailed.  I can't remember the last time I was so excited to send cards to my friends!  The only thing I didn't like?  Sending them all out - I love them so much, I'm going to order a set for myself so that I can frame them and put them around the house!",Positive
These are beautiful,Positive
"This is the second item I’ve bought from them. The rings are beautiful and nit too bulky.  I have moonstone and the blue stone in silver. Both are well made, impeccably finished and really unique.  Great value fir money and you’ll get compliments from every when they see it.",Positive
A perfect gift for someone special. Very fast turn around and high quality.,Positive
So pretty!,Positive
I love this belt.  It’s very heavy and really good quality.  The leather is holding out really well and the metal belt buckle is really high quality.  Definitely worth the money.,Positive
My 6 year old wanted this for her bedroom. I had to buy a separate frame for it since this is just the print. Very cute print. The only thing that would make it better is if it came with a frame.,Positive
The photo was beautiful and was exactly what we needed for a party as decor. Would buy again.,Positive
"Very fast delivery, received item within 5 days of placing the order and that included the holidays! I absolutely love these bracelets that Stephanie makes by hand and infuses with Reiki. Better quality than other sites. I have just started to learn about crystals, so I like knowing that I am buying real gemstones, not plastic or imitation, while at the same time supporting a small business owner here in the US. I also appreciate the descriptions she includes with each bracelet. I have purchased 2 bracelets so far and plan on buying many more!",Positive
Just perfect match my outfit!!!!,Positive
Got these for my girlfriend's birthday to go to dinner.<br />She loves cats and actually has a black cat so naturally she loves them!<br />Thanks,Positive

Perfect,Positive
These earrings came up when I searched “Keeshond jewelry” and I’m so glad they did. I ordered them for my mom for Christmas. They arrived in gift-ready packaging and are so cute I had to order the necklace for myself.,Positive
"I love these Mason jar sconces.  I reviewed picture scale, height and position above couches for weeks before deciding on these.  In old farmhouses, it’s difficult to make modern furniture and technology work, so planning is essential!  The sconce wood frames are lightweight and arrive ready to hang.  The hardware is sturdy (back hangers and wrought iron hooks).  I purchased the fairy lights separately on Amazon, and found buying four light strings with a remote the most convenient way to go for this look.  I added flowers, vase filler  and lights to the jars.  Like other reviewers, the battery pack on the lights I purchased did not fit inside the jar mouth, so I secured with twist ties and placed the battery packs on the jar tops.  Flowers cover the battery packs.  The sconces arrived earlier than expected and very well packed...I even received a notification from Amazon and the seller to ensure their arrival.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Thank you!",Positive
These shoe clips are beautiful!!!,Positive
Honestly was worth the money and wait<br />Dainty and a nice staple to wardrobe!,Positive
The ring is very nice. I just got it. I will see if it scratches.<br />It seems a bit smaller then I thought it would be.,Positive
every thing about this press is great,Positive
Before I found these at Amazon I would go to the state fair to purchase this kind of  dish cloth from a nice lady in a booth that I had to hunt for... Amazon makes it a lot easier. Better than a stinky old sponge and it washes up great.,Positive
IN LOVE WITH THIS TAG! Thank you so much!,Positive
Quality item,Positive
Absolutely love everything about this. The package was very protected. The colors used were vivid with clear crisp lines. I adore this!,Positive
Great glassware.,Positive

The little guy I bought this for for Christmas LOVES it.  Quality is great!,Positive

I love Charleston and love the pictures on the calendar.,Positive
"I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase! I loved the fact that the customized name was created and shipped immediately. I received it sooner than I had expected which is nice. I am giving the seller 5 stars and a thumbs up for replying so fast to my special request on the side of my customization already! The name was painted white and it goes perfect in our soon to be newborns room. The only thing is that it doesn't come with anything to be hung, but it wasn't a major issue we were able to purchase double sided heavy duty tape for 10lbs so it should hold up since we didn't want to nail the pretty thing.",Positive
 ,Positive
"They are nice.  Initially I had a problem but after working with the seller, everything worked out ok.",Positive
"Juste LOVE IT! Everything is perfect! Design, size, fast delivery ♥️ Thank you",Positive

"Much easier to take on and off.  My only complaint is that it's a little loose, especially in cooler weather, but that may have been a measurement error on my part.  It fits great in the heat when my arm is a little fatter.",Positive
"Great quality! I love the colour (I got the purple travel wallet, passport holder and key ring with silver name tags). Just a pity not all the other items come in all the colours, like the luggage tags, so check what else you planning to order before just ordering if you a colour coordinator like me. I like things to match...<br /><br />...and makes great gifts!",Positive
Love it !!,Positive

I made cookies for my son who is in the Marine Corps... it was perfect!!,Positive

I love it,Positive
Looks perfect in the nursery. Well made!!,Positive
Awesome earrings amazing workmanship,Positive
Installing it was easy but don’t rush.  I screwed up on the last “S” in “EXCUSES” and took a chance that the manufacturer/seller would comp a replacement letter AND they did!  Received two in fact by regular mail within 3 days!  I really like the silver finish against the blackboard.  It’s wonderful!!<br /><br />2/23 Update:  NOW it’s finished!  It’s just exactly as I imagined my new workout wall should be!,Positive
"I wanted to buy my grandmother a candle, but really liked this as a safer alternative!",Positive
Gorgeous and true to the picture. Also came with a hand written note from the creator. I use it for my cross stitch needles. It came with 3 pins as well. I love it.,Positive

So cute! Can’t wait to hang it in my bathroom when it’s complete,Positive

Purchased for my boss for her birthday. She loved it but the prints did not have the 1/2” border for framing which made it a challenge to frame. Otherwise was happy with the purchase.,Positive

Perfect! My daughter loved this!,Positive

"I lost the tags I had originally ordered for my kids baskets the week of Easter. I scrambled to find something that might make it in time and I found these, yay! They arrived the day before Easter. So from placing my ordered to it arriving at my door was 5 days. Not bad for a custom item!<br /><br />I wanted to add a pop of color to my kids baskets, so I did a paint wash on them. 1 part acrylic paint to 2 parts water and coat with sealant once it’s dry.",Positive
I wear casual a lot and this piece of jewelry is perfect for casual.  Love the simple design but pretty.  I have had a lot of compliments on this one piece of pretty.,Positive
My bonus daughter loved it!,Positive
very nice sculpture,Positive
"The prints themselves are great. They came with cardboard in the package to prevent folding and each was in its own plastic wrapper. I mistakingly thought this set had the narwhal in it, so it was a disappointment when it didn’t (but that’s on me). My only issue was how slow shipping was. When ordering it says takes 1-3 days to make, ok that’s fine, but I think the default shipping (free shipping) must be the slowest shipping method there is.",Positive
Cute for my granddaughter.  Wish the chain was a little daintier for a girl.,Positive
Just received the jewelry and it was nicely wrapped and a hand written thank you card .  This was purchased as a gift but I took a peek and it’s absolutely beautiful ❤️,Positive

It's a well made product in a cute packaging along with bonus gift and a handwritten note from the seller.<br /><br />Dar, you made his day. Thank you!",Positive

Thank you for making such a quality product!! Will def tell friends about this one!,Positive
"I'm allergic to nickel and gold and am really self conscious of my asymmetrical earlobes.  One is attached and the other is slightly detached.  When I got my ears pierced as a young teenager, the piercer leveled the holes to each other but didn't center them on my ears.  So ever since, I've always felt that studs just emphasize that and make me look lopsided.  Not these though!  I had never heard of mismatched earrings before, but these are amazing!  They're really well made and look fantastic!  I also have very small ears, so they are a little bit larger than I had expected.  However, they still fit my ears well!  The leaves are also just super cute!  The posts and backs are made from stainless steel (no nickel!) so I have not had any allergic reactions while wearing them.",Positive
"At last, I found my face mask! I'm 6'3"" and have a beard. And a head proportional to my body size.<br />I've bought a half-dozen different kinds of masks, and have always been disappointed by how small they were in spite of claims. All of my other masks went from my nose bridge to just under my chin and barely stayed in place (they would creep up).<br />This mask is simply perfect for me. It covers me from my nose bridge to just above my Adam's apple including my (trim) beard. It is meant for big heads: this is the first time I had to tighten the ear loops (vs. tossing the rubber rings), so I might be on small-average size for this mask size. One feature I haven't tried yet is inserting a disposable surgical mask to use as a filter (instead of the typical, small disposable mask filters.) I saw several other XL/XXL masks but they didn't have both a metal nose piece (required to fit under glasses and not fog them up) AND the ability to insert a filter. This mask has both. It's also softer than my other fabric masks, FYI. After receiving the mask, trying it on and liking it, I ordered 5 more (one per car and per house door). This may be Day-1 infatuation, but from someone who's been on lock-down for 7 months, I kinda know my way around face masks. Highly recommended!",Positive
"This is a very good, calming toy! It is in a glass bottle, so beware of that, but our whole family has enjoyed this!",Positive
I ordered the spin ring just a few days ago. I've always been a bit reluctant to order anything that is not *Prime as I've had a bad experience in the past. But Steel Lynx has great reviews already and the price was more than affordable.<br />my Spin ring arrived well ahead of the estimated time frame.<br />The colors I chose are vibrant and exciting and even better in person. I'm so happy with my chosen custom colorization.<br />The spin ring is not really meant to be worn as a constant wear ring as the multi ring bands makes the ring a bit bulky on my finger and that's totally ok. Just when my hands a bored and something to fidget with.<br />I absolutely LOVE this and I will definitely Order from Steel Lynx again! And soon!,Positive
Wife loved it,Positive
Showed up much quicker than expected and is exactly what my home was missing. Absolutely love my new functional art work,Positive

Really love the simple ness for our newborns nursery! Turned out so cute!,Positive
"This is a great checkbook holder that adds style to any home office. The outside button closes securely, and the leather material makes you feel like you have plenty of money in the bank. It is a bit thick, indicating high quality and durability, but perhaps a little bit too thick to be easily pocket-portable.",Positive
Exactly what my husband wanted.,Positive
Perfect idea cakestand,Positive

"So my mistake I got the wrong size. I have 2 lil chihuahuas so i got xs which is fine but the size makes it a bit difficult to read. That also might be the font i used. I will order more for sure. These are thick, durable and somehow also very lightweight. Honestly the xs would be perfect for teacups or bunnies so im not mad about it. Definitely my mistake. Just wish I could use them while they are boarded during our travels. Thats life…u live and hopefully learn. You can see from my photos how shiny it is and tiny! Lol!",Positive
"Bought it for my Dad. The engraving is nice but the pocket watch itself is much smaller than it looks in the picture. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",Positive
Omg my boyfriend loved these I got a set of four and he was in aww. Super impressed.,Positive
LOVE THESE TREES THEY TWINKLE,Positive
Love this sign. I get more comments from anyone who shows up on our farm because of this sign. A chuckle or two along with a questioning look at me on whether they will end up there or not. Anything to bring a smile to your face.,Positive

"These are beautiful invitations! The paper was a heavy matte card stock (stronger than I thought they would be).

As an added bonus, they arrived two days early! I will buy from this company again!!",Positive
They’re perfect! For the price and quality this is an amazing buy. Very happy,Positive
This company is the best.  I needed cutouts of certain states for Christmas gifts & this company came through.  I've gotten several states from them & they arrive fast.  I get the smaller 3 inch size.  They are well made & take staining really well although I've left some natural.  Great for my crafting.,Positive

I have been wanting this for awhile. This Christmas I purchased this one. We love it. ❤️ Beautiful addition to the tree 🌲 Thank you 🙏🏼,Positive
Nice colors but I think it is way overpriced.,Positive

"Turns out this is a small replica of a larger number sticker.  this one is much smaller and more compact, like a baby bumper sticker.  Rubber baby buggy bumpers...  Good sticker that says UpState, if you put it on something be prepared to answer the question every few minutes.. upstate where?  But other than that it is a fantastic product, would definitely recommend.",Positive
Who doesn’t want this hanging from the back of their crocs? The only issue was they don’t stay on.,Positive

The mug is exactly as described. The artwork is very nice. I would prefer if the lid were of better quality and leak proof. Other than that this product is great. I believe another lid could be found elsewhere.,Positive
"I love this shirt, it’s so comfortable and fit me perfectly!!",Positive
"The quality of these nose rings are amazing! They’re sturdy and well made. Unfortunately, it didn’t work for me. The shape and the thickness of the ring post was too wide/difficult to fit through my piercing hole.",Positive
Makes a wonderful gift ☺️,Positive
These were perfect!! Definitely worth it!! They were professionally done and super easy to put over large hershey candy bars!! They looked like the manufacturer made them for us!! 🙂,Positive
"***Update from 1 Star to 4 Stars***<br />I contacted the seller about the problem as the name was not in script as I had ordered and engraving was faint.  They responded very quickly and offered a replacement.  The replacement also arrived promptly in a gift pouch (I already have the gift box) and it is much improved (see for yourself).  I am glad that I reached out to them and I am grateful for them standing by their product and service to correct errors and satisfy customers.  Updating the review facts is the very least I can do.  I appreciate this company and I’d buy from again.  I hope any other unsatisfied customers reached out to them.  Even if you’ve given the gift, wouldn’t it be better to give them a chance to correct it?<br /><br />———————<br /><br />(Original Review before update:I’m so disappointed.  I ordered script and they stamped/engraved it as separate letters, which with a short name looks horrible!  The engraving is so shallow and small you can barely see it.  This is NOT what is represented in their samples and other pictures.  I read one review about this issue but it was buried in so many glowing reviews I discounted it.  I should have gone with my gut.  Returning if they let me.)",Positive
"Great product, you can tell at first glance is made with quality! I'm getting a couple more for gifts! Wooden comb and sturdy bottle opener, light weight and pocket size. Just great for the price!!!",Positive
We have had all kinds of compliments on this sign. I think it goes perfect in the bathroom. It was sturdy and in awesome shape. We haven’t had any issues with it since we got it either.,Positive
Love everything about these! Sooo many details & they glisten beautifully in sunlight! One of them cracked and the seller sent us replacemnts right away! They’re beautifully crafted and very unique!

Works for children and smells good,Positive
I bought this for my grandparents and they absolutely love it! It is so beautiful,Positive
Seriously gorgeous. Totally in love with these and can’t wait to put them up in my toddler’s new room. I purchased these and a pack of white wood frames from Michael’s.. so I have six framed prints for my daughter’s room for less than $35. Can’t beat it!,Positive
"FUN TO HAVE, LOVE WHEN MY GRANDSON HITS IT BEFORE BEDTIME AT NIGHT. PUTS A SMILE ON MY FACE",Positive
"Not just regular paper, they are the thick, smooth, flimsy kind. Super cute",Positive
"The product looks great, and the finishing is top notch. Arrived as per the promised delivery date, thought we ordered during the Thanksgiving holidays. The only thing that could be improved is the customer service - prior to placing the order, I wanted to confirm what sizing would be best. But the customer care never reverted, so I went with my gut. Would have appreciated a response!<br /><br />For reference purposes, the size we chose for a 9 character name was 24 inches. The font we chose was Cookie.",Positive
These turned out just as they were advertised! Cute and simple. Hard plastic that's very durable. I mainly bought these to help my nursery workers at church  identify my boys' diaper bag without having to put a sticky label on the bag every week.<br />I bought my oldest boy one for his pre-school backpack too but I typically don't like to have his name broadcasted on his bag unless I'm around. It's nice that these can easily be removed if needed.,Positive
These are well made and very pretty.,Positive
Very cute! Got many compliments on them!😍,Positive
"I love the pendant. It's accurate and well-made. It has a good weight and the chain has a good length too. The pendant is a little smaller than I thought, but I don't have any complaints. It's a great gift for anyone who loves ATLA and I'm very happy with my purchase.",Positive
Super fast shipping and a beautiful strong rosary. Everything I had hoped for!,Positive
Fast shipping; appropriate durable shipping box; ready to frame. Great addition to our guest room themed for our home city Chicago (wish it would read 'sweet home chicago' though! Come onn. Classic),Positive
"This is a nice candle. It does seem a little pricey but it does smell very nice. I don't know that I would call it a campfire smell, but it is definitely a nice outdoor smell.",Positive
Got this for my grandson for Christmas. He just got his 1st car and I think he'll love this keychain. Looks well-made and his name looks nice on it. Fast delivery too!,Positive
There just the right size and very beautiful,Positive
"Nice,  my daughter loved it",Positive
I love it! It was just what I was hoping for and it came within the week of ordering,Positive
Really great quality! Love this case!,Positive
"As a bona fide &#34;crazy&#34; appaloosa lady, I was thrilled when I received this necklace. I get compliments every time I wear it.",Positive
"Feels great going on, not greasy, and seems to work. I say seems to, because I only used it once. My grandson came to visit soon after, and used on a sore spot. He loved it,  It went home with him!",Positive
The craftsmanship and artistry is superior. I was in awe at how beautiful and whimsical the miniature glass figurines are. Each little figurine was wrapped in bubble wrap and arrived without a chip.,Positive
Beautiful.  My daughter loves it. It's a perfect size and has had quite a few compliments on it.,Positive
Good quality very nice I recommend and a great price for the name is printed on and doesn’t scratch off easily .,Positive
I am I love with my new mirrors.,Positive
Love it but it didn’t come in the size I expected,Positive
I like the style and I get a lot of compliments on them. Would buy similar earrings.,Positive
"Y’all. I obviously didn’t read the description, because now I see that it clearly states that this is hand painted and not a vinyl decal, so I was INCREDIBLY impressed when I realized the artistry that went into this. It is GLORIOUS. My brother passed away unexpectedly two weeks ago, and Jeff Goldblum was our “thing”. Oh, the inside jokes and memes we sent back and forth! This wine glass makes me incredibly happy and I will think of him every time I use it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. If you are on the fence about whether or not you need this epic Goldblum glass, let me tell you right meow... YES. YOU NEED IT. Just add it to your cart now. You won’t be disappointed.",Positive
Great way to keep my mom's memory alive this past year was the first Christmas without her. It also comes with this little paper heart I believe that you can plant we haven't got the chance to plant it. Very sentimental,Positive

Bought this for my daughter in law and she loved it,Positive
"My wife have had the best and most memorable vacations in Hawaii.  My 3-year old grandson loves to collect sea glass.  I bought this necklace for my wife so that she thinks of Hawaii and our grandson each time she wears.  Even though she received so many other Christmas gifts that were more elaborate and much expensive, she loved her necklace more than anything.  Note to husbands:  This is the gift that got be a big hug!  It came in a nice little blue box with a white ribbon.  The gift box and the necklace are simple elegance.  Great value!  Great gift!",Positive

Love the fragrance,Positive
These wine charms are quite attractive and guests actually look to see who got what. I gave them as Christmas gifts,Positive
"I am pleased with the purse,  letting it air out now since I just opened it from packing,  My Ipad fits easily and that was what I wanted,  Only thing that isn’t what I expected, my iPhone won’t fit in the exterior pockets or side pockets so I will have to put it inside, but I can live with that,,,,<br />Very nice purse and I recommend getting it …..thank you for the note inside too, good touch,,,,,donna",Positive
"Got here in great timing! I will state that upon picture, the flash won't be the same as all Labradorite is different. I did wish mine had more flash, but in the right light you can see the pretty deep blue flash. Make sure to read the size of the necklace before ordering. ☺️",Positive
Absolutely stunning!,Positive
"Beautiful, functional piece- love his work.  Goes great with the sponge holder.",Positive
Was a big hit. Nice looking. Somewhat frail and thin.  But served its purpose beautifully.,Positive
Bought these as an anniversary present for my husband and he loves them.,Positive
the mask came quickly and well packed can't wait to wear it on my wedding,Positive
"Bought for my son and DIL when they bought a new house. It's really quality made and can go on any wall. You could also paint it a different color, but my son really liked the natural wood on his cream wall. It's right in their breakfast room so they must like it.",Positive
"She looks precious on our tree. I wanted a big bow and my husband grew up with angel on the tree, so we compromised. Our tree is really big and full, and my walls are white. If I had it to do again, I’d have ordered a red one so she would show up better, but still love her!",Positive
"I fell in love with the well as its craftmanship and I purchased it. No hesitation.  It was beautiful and looked fragile, but holds up to rugged shipping containers.  I have not seen this product in the US, so that makes it unique and a great conversation piece. I am well pleased with this wishing well.",Positive
Such good quality! Wanting to buy another one!,Positive
Beautiful and soft material. I love the design. I bought several to give as gifts they’re so lovely. Spacious on the inside to fit your makeup needs to travel bottles when traveling. Really beautiful and amazing price.,Positive
"Fantastic product, works like a charm, and looks great.",Positive
"My wife made soap out of this scent. It has a powerful scent when being used, but it dissipates quickly. If you don't want a lingering perfume smell it is perfect.",Positive
Excellent quality and great service.,Positive
Looks great on the front door.,Positive
Best ever!!,Positive
A great gift for my whiskey & gun loving friends!,Positive
Really sweet & cake-y!,Positive
Son cómodas y livianas pero la piedra es mucho más pequeña de lo que dicen vienen siendo un 2mm .,Positive
I love this necklace. It is delicate and gorgeous Shipping was fast as well.,Positive
I get many compliments on this necklace. I have purchased it for my three of my friends as well. It does not look cheap like other reviews are stating. The necklace also compliments so many outfits.,Positive
It was exactly as described and portrayed.<br />Thank you.,Positive
"This is a beautifully crafted hatchet loop made of sturdy, attractively tanned leather with four metal fasteners (fastens the tool loop to the belt loop). Man, the price was excellent and to think buying this supports a small business craftsman right here in the ol' USA. Cannot recommend highly enough.",Positive
Easy to install and looks great!  Exactly what needed to display my street number.,Positive
"I just wanted to thank you for this beautiful delicate pentacle neclace. I can't tell you how much it means to me to be able to show a little bit of my truth to the world, even if I don't speak it aloud. Thank You kind soul.",Positive

I love these. They’re so unlike anything i’ve Seen in a long time. And very well made. High quality. I wear them with everything!,Positive
I wear this lanyard to work. It's durable and so adorable.,Positive
"I've had my nose pierced before and had a hoop in it for about a year when I took it out for about a week and it grew back. I went to get another piercing later and I had a horrible time with a bump and infection so I basically gave up. I thought this may be a good idea because I don't have to actually get a piercing. It turned out great! I love that there are two colors for a good price. I also like the size. It's almost too small for my nose but it fits well. I'm a little worried it will fall out, but what else would you expect with a fake piercing? Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase!",Positive
"Just what I needed for summer, well made!",Positive
"Exactly as pictured and described.  Very beautiful, colors are vibrant, and it's nice and thick.  It's great to have in my kitchen to set hot items on, or use as a coaster for large cups of soup.  I bought 2 of different designs and plan on getting a couple more.",Positive
I really love how these are customizable! It’s a little weird that it’s just a sticker but that’s totally cool because it still made a great gift.,Positive
This print is perfect for my son's room. I put it in a black frame and it looks amazing!,Positive
Love these big hit in my bathroom,Positive
"It came super quick, the seller was easy to get on contact with, and the tag is perfect! I did think I chose a different color but my fat thumbs must have betrayed me. Happy with the ‘rose’ colored one we received!",Positive
I use it daily for work,Positive
Perfect for Father's Day!,Positive
It came out great and can't wait to put on our cabin door next cruise!!!,Positive
"1818 Farms Shea Creme is amazing!  Although the jar is feather-light, the creme is the only creme that made the skin on my feet soft & supple.  Having used many other products of all price ranges, this is the one  not only effective but above and beyond!",Positive
"I bought this Motivational Poster to put on the wall in my gym. I read it every day before I start working out, it pumps me up to give it my all and to workout harder. The Quality and Price are Excellent.",Positive
"I'm using this product to hold my fitbit, because the bands break over time after popping the fitbit in/out. This made to order band is PERFECT. Once you get the fitbit INSIDE BOTH ENDs (think of the old original sandwich bags fold and flip over securement), the fitbit stays inside and can't come out until you work (and I mean you got to work) the little INSIDE securement UNDER the fitbit so it will pop out. It's safe, soft, and easy to put on my ankle, and wear under my socks OR right on tip of low-cut socks without interfering with walking, activity OR sleeping. I'd recommend this to anyone AND HOPE the Seller offers other colors (I'd buy MORE).",Positive
Adorable thanks !,Positive
Fits just right in my hall easy to assemble and to stain,Positive
Whimsical,Positive
Really like this ring. It is beautiful and different,Positive
I love it! Came just as expected.,Positive
I feel honored to have this piece in the entryway of our home. Beautiful. Thank you.,Positive
"The craftsmanship of this clock is stunning. I have seen similar clocks online, but I love the design and quality of this one the most. I bought the 16"" clock because I thought 11"" would be too small, and honestly part of me wishes I had gone for the 18"", but 16"" is fine for my needs. Can easily be seen and read from a distance.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings then I highly recommend getting this clock.<br /><br />My only complain is that the clock arms could be nicer quality. The second hand arrived a little bent, but it was easy to bend back into place. They are functional, but with how nice the rest of the clock looks they look a little plain.",Positive
"Excellent value for good quality, good price, and absolutely top notch service.  The price was quite competitive compared to any other personalized travel map I could find. Tom got on the order the day I placed it, confirmed the size (48""x30"") and personalization that I desired, and sent it on its way. The maps was well-protected for shipping, and it was at our door the next day!  Everything was exactly as ordered, including the color of the pins, which have 1/4"" heads-a larger size that is much classier and easier to handle.  (The blue pins show up better in the first picture--there are 4 times as many in silver, which stand out much better in reality.)  Quality is fine, no defects, no issues. All measurements perfect: ready for hanging and placing your pins. Now I'm thinking about framing it--once you see it on the wall, it's absolutely frameworthy.",Positive
I truly like this Lilac room spray.  It handles odors quickly and leaves a very pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming like some air fresheners can be.  I would highly recommend this product!! AN,Positive
"I had one made for the shed/outdoor bar we just finished.  The photo might not do it justice, but it works extremely well with the finished project.",Positive
"Wife just loved it ,mad her cry with happy tears",Positive
"14K Gold part is great. But, Lapis Lazuli is much smaller than expected. In my opinion, its size is the size of penny or dime. The size should be the size of quarter. Lapis Lazuli is one of relatively cheap gemstones. So, I don’t understand the reason why it is so small.  Its color should be brighter, too.",Positive
I love the craftsmanship. Very well made with top notch yarn and solid. Very fun to have on my tree!,Positive
"I ordered two, the gold one and the silver one, i really love them, finally o found a razonable price for a gold ring!!!!",Positive
"Well made, heavy duty legs. Fit my table top perfectly. I clear coated before installing as I didn't want any potential rust stains, even though I was using inside.",Positive
"Not as thick as I thought, like the one my mother had, when I was a kid. Also the print is very tiny and there is NO print, on the smaller, token-sized one.<br />Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this purchase❣👍🏾",Positive
The color of the glass was beautiful and the quality was superb.,Positive
Fast delivery,Positive
Use to keep my shawl on when I'm working in my drafty Maine house. Very useful!,Positive
I purchased these for a gift because I did not get enough gifts on a recent trip to Paris.  These are very nice and large for the price and are better than ones I purchased for 20 euros at a souvenir shop in Paris near the Eiffel Tower.,Positive
Great quality print.,Positive
She loved it!,Positive
Gift for my BFF for Xmas - she loved it!,Positive
"Love the simplicity, yet elegance, of these earrings.",Positive
These are exactly what I wanted and they were packaged beautifully. The little touch of including a storage bag for in between times is absolutely perfect and unexpected.,Positive
"I love love love the design! I specifically purchased this one because it has a butterfly look to it without being childish. It is sturdy, yet lightweight, and it was packaged very well. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because part of the metal was not as smooth as the rest of the item, so the black paint did not coat as well making it look rough in that spot, and there were some scratched spots on the back. Also, even though it was packaged extremely well, it was still a tad bit warped when it arrived, making it difficult to lay flat against the wall. Regardless of those minor issues, I would definitely purchase again! And just might! Awesome product!",Positive
Super cute! My every day go to necklace now!,Positive
"The toe ring is very small and the stones are quite small. Aliitle pricey! Although, I do like it.",Positive
"Great Christmas gift for my wife, she loves them.",Positive
"I order the rose perfume all the time because it is my most favorite thing in the world. I get countless compliments on it. Most recently, my package was taken from my doorstep and this amazing company was kind enough to send me a replacement. THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Wonderful product, wonderful company.",Positive
"My 3 year old son loves them and so do I, they are perfect for his bedroom!",Positive
Absolutely loved it! (Don’t mind the mirror took the picture fast),Positive
Bag was great! You can tell the craftsmanship and love that went into this bag. My fiancé and I used it for our 3 week trip to Europe as a day bag and it worked perfect. Very secure to make sure no one pickpockets you due to the buckles.,Positive
Communication with seller was excellent. The leather is awesome. Having the ability to have it personalized was an even better touch. It was exactly what I was looking for. Very satisfied. Would definitely recommend To a friend.,Positive
Liked this because of value and it's something that is close (key ring) for a daily reminder of special events.  Well received as a man's gift.,Positive
This such a beautiful ring and the ruby is quite bright and vivid. This is my 2nd ring from Anemone and I am very impressed with the quality.,Positive
Don’t even want to burn this it’s so beautiful.,Positive
Loved it and so did my granddaughter.  Very good quality and a great keepsake for years to come.,Positive
This bracelet was a early valentines gift from my husband and it was perfect! I love wearing it. I did go get the chain cut down so it would not dangle down. I love this bracelet. It would be perfect as a gift for someone or if you just want to treat yourself!,Positive
I found this bag to carry a weeks worth of clothes plus shoes. It looks great and is very well made. The best thing about this bag is that my purchase supplies income to a poor country.,Positive
Well made and perfect touch to the baby room. Thank you!!,Positive
These were so cute!!!!! I loved it!,Positive
"They were great, no issues at all. I got them for my brother who is studying to be a electrical engineer. My only criticism if there had to be one is I wish they were just a bit bigger but I loved them and so did my brother. Great Job and Thank you",Positive
"I love it!  I purchased Lizzy and Darcy from the Jane Austen Centre in Bath some time ago, and now Jane hangs on my tree between them, making sure they behave themselves!",Positive
Absolutely love this! I got it to honor my son who's a true warrior. He was born premature and overcame all odds and made it out on top! Thank you for such a great product! It reminds me every day to stay strong no matter what I face!,Positive

I love it so much,Positive
My favorite nose stud. Looks slightly different than the picture though.,Positive
"Very cool print!  It's several photos of SF superimposed and with more vivid colors .  Colors are as pictured.  Canvas is wrapped fine.  Easy to hang, has teeth hangers already on it.",Positive
Very unique put it on my bathroom door,Positive
They were smaller than anticipated but still beautiful,Positive
Beautifully crafted,Positive
Works as it should!,Positive
My wife absolutely loved these earrings! How original and creative......and 100% of the money goes to a great cause. Thanks for making Valentines Day a success......but they are a great gift year-round.,Positive
I love it. Excellent quality!,Positive
I gave it to a good friend for her birthday gift and she absolutely loves it,Positive

Color faded super fast,Positive
Absolutely adorable!,Positive
Perfect,Positive
"I didn't get these as fast as I wanted, but they were well worth the wait!  I am refashioning a few boleros, lining them with lace and adding these along with black pearls. I am very proud to have them.  I love cameos... now I love brownskinthings cameos. They are made with great care it seems.  Clean and formed well with so much detail. I hope in the future more designs will be made... maybe even custom ones? I will treasure them and i would recommend that if your thinking on buying , you should right away!!!",Positive
"I currently have the actual Jo Malone velvet rose and oud & I can 100% without a doubt say that it smells exactly the same!!! The only downside is that it doesn’t radiate and last as long as the actual perfume, although I admit that is to be expected! I would definitely recommend this if you’re looking for the same scent in an affordable travel size to take everywhere with you!",Positive
"Loved how my order came out, and it arrived so quickly. Thank You!!",Positive
MUCH SMALLER THAN ANTICIPATED,Positive
"I build farmhouse tables and in the past have made legs several different ways, but when I saw these, I knew I had to have them for my personal table! They're beautiful! I've never had a complaint about the craftsmanship of Carolina leg Co. And will continue to purchase from them! Definitely 10/10 would recommend.",Positive
Great quality and packaging. Looks exactly like the pictures posted. Color combo is spot-on accurate.  Arrived within the week. Love everything about it!,Positive

It's a gift for my MIL and I really hope she likes them. I like them and will be getting a pair myself.,Positive

Nice but needs more color saturation,Positive
My guests love seeing this!,Positive
 ,Positive
"High quality pages, helpful layout. Exactly what I needed..",Positive
"I absolutely love this ring! The quality is wonderful and I love how unique it is. It should be noted that the rock can vary from the picture because of it being a &#34;raw&#34; gem stone, but that's what makes it so unique! The only thing I would warn is that the sizing seems to be slightly off (at least compared to U.S. sizing). I ordered a 7.75 in hopes to wear the ring on my ring finger, however, it seems to fit more like a size 8, so I am wearing it on my middle finger. Either way, I love the ring and I would highly suggest ordering it! It truly is beautiful.",Positive
Perfection.... my Granddaughter love it....,Positive
I love this case. I constantly get comments on it as well. The leather is soft and breaks in really well. I have had it four months now and it feels great. I carry five cards and a few business cards at all times and they are snug but they fit.  My only con is that sometimes for some reason people have a hard time hearing me on my phone. It only happens a few times in a week. But the phone easily pops out of the case so they can hear me. We are still trying to figure out what is going on. It might not be the case but rather my phone.,Positive
This makes me soooooooo darn HAPPY!  Bwa ha ha ha!,Positive
This was great.  The quality is really good and it really made a difference in the birthday's decoration.,Positive
Quality,Positive
"I have been looking for this style of watch strap for several years.  This one is the best quality I have come across .  It will even fit larger sized wrists, unlike all the others I have purchased in the past.  The strap is wel made and looks very sharp.  Highly recommended.",Positive
I'm so happy with my purchase. It took a while to come due to a little mess up with my post office but the sellers contacted me immediately when the shipping time ran out and sent me a new one along with the a little extra gift to it. It was for my mother's birthday and mother's day that fell on the same day for her dreads and she loves it. This item deserves the hype,Positive
I gave it a four stars because it took a little while for me to rub the letters on the glass and every time I try to peel it it wasn’t sticking so I had to really really take my time but other than that it looks great I love it,Positive
Presentation and quality of item is appreciated,Positive
"I hung this on my door. I can't read it without reading it in Galdalf/Frodo's voice. Love it. The only thing I will say that I was on the fence about, is it IS a bit expensive in my opinion. It's good quality, don't get me wrong... but just seemed a bit expensive.",Positive
I got this necklace for my mom for mothers day and she loves it! I was surprised about the size. The silver ring is about the same circumference as a quarter. But none the less a stunning piece! It also came in a very cute blue box.,Positive
So cute. Strong magnet. Should stand up to sometimes getting a few drops of water on it.,Positive
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE IT!!! Beautiful pieces! Would definitely recommend!,Positive
Great fory girls soccer drink container!,Positive
"Very happy with my purchase, looks exactly as I hoped it would and got here fast. Very easy to apply and looks great.",Positive
"Ms Alisha did an AMAZING job of creating a beautiful rose for my wedding. I purchased it for my bride-to-be, because she is a huge fan of &#34;Beauty & the Beast&#34;... the amount of time and energy she put into making the rose is only eclipsed by her willingness to customize her creation to give it a special, almost intimate touch. Her idea of customer service is out of this world, because she wanted to make absolutely sure I was happy with EVERY aspect of her creation...<br />Her attention to detail is second to none, and I will tell you right now, if you're looking for a special, one-of-a-kind gift for that special someone, look no further. Alisha can do it... she has been in contact with me since I first ordered, wanting to make sure EVERY DETAIL is perfect.<br />For the amount of time she puts into her work, the price is a BARGAIN. Alisha's talent is abundantly clear when you see her finished work. Give her a try... you will NOT be disappointed.<br />And now, to Alisha... I can't thank you enough for the time and care you placed in the crafting of this gift. I wish nothing but the best for you in your business!",Positive
Exactly what I needed. I have already used the sheets for some laser cutting projects I had. Quick shipping and great service. Thank you,Positive
Really cool and unique necklace. Seems to be really good quality and is the perfect size and length. I’m very glad I bought it and I will definitely be purchasing more from the seller in the future.,Positive
Perfect! Looks amazing in my living room.,Positive
Greta quality! Better than expected.,Positive
"I greatly appreciate the customization options that allowed me to order two similar yet unique gifts for my two sons and their spouses to commemorate each of their weddings.  The folks at DreamTree Prints did a very nice job of processing my order with the information I provided.  The prints arrived faster than I anticipated and were packaged with such care that they both arrived in perfect condition.  Now if I can only hold up my end with  the shadowbox frames I'm building to display the prints, along with special mementos from the kids' weddings, then I think their gifts will be a hit.  I won't hesitate to order from DreamTree Prints again!  Thank you  for the personal touches, including the handwritten note that you included with the order.",Positive
It's nice just one small problem is the one panel keeps popping off,Positive
"Simple, old school, more authentic.",Positive
"I don’t often write reviews but I was very happy to find this seller because since I stretched my ears, I can’t find jewelry that looks dressy lol. Anyway, this seller makes lovely items, I am happy with my purchase and you won’t be disappointed if you buy from this store.",Positive
Only wish it came in other colors,Positive
Definitely better than the rest. The scent could be stronger,Positive
"It came with a place for screws to attach into their holes, but no screws. I'm wondering if there's an easier way to hang it on the wall.  It's a great piece I like it a lot",Positive
Ordered these prints for my little girl’s nursery. Each are printed on quality card stock and came well packaged. I didn’t want a frilly all-pink nursery and these prints have a elegant touch of femininity.,Positive
I get so many compliments on this ring. Great quality. I would definitely recommend.,Positive
Looks like picture. Fast delivery. Very pretty. Would buy from them again.,Positive
My daughter loves this!,Positive
She loved it!!!!!,Positive
Beautiful prints and excellent customer service!,Positive
Soft suede and absolutely a great gift.,Positive
Beautifully done. Purchased as a gift for my sister & had her name painted on the base. She loved it!,Positive
I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it!  She uses it to carry all her stuff with her to work.  It is a tad smaller than I expected- but to be honest I didn't look at the measurements.  BUT- that's ok- because she loves it!  Sewn in customization is gorgeous and makes the tote one of a kind!,Positive
"Loved this product. It took two weeks to arrive probably because of the shipping delays. The dog tags are made of good quality. Easy to read, cute font and design. The seller even packaged it up nicely and left a little note!",Positive
Glass looked great. A gift for my father in law who was shot at in Vietnam. Would have been great to have the Vietnam flag on it.,Positive
"I ordered three of these for my family for Christmas and one of the packages didn’t make it. When I notified the seller, she remade the product immediately and sent it ASAP. I was really impressed by the quick follow up and how well she took care of me as a customer.<br />We also love the product and it’s been keeping my kids using their own chargers instead of mine!",Positive
I was surprised how nice it was and looks great in my planner.,Positive
Well executed. It was a joy to give as a xmas present.,Positive
Exactly what I was looking for to put on my toy Shih Tzu pups.,Positive
"It was a beautiful hanger and exactly what I was looking for, and I had to fly it 4.5 hours where we got married, so I wrapped a little carbonara over the name and crossed my fingers and it was not effected by the plane ride so I was happy to see it traveled well, my only suggestion would be that it could have had the date displayed under the hook of the hanger and or the place/venue  instead of the fake flower decoration… still did what I wanted it to for my big day!",Positive
Grandson loved looking at his birthday pictures that were developed and placed into the album. His birthday theme was Lion King 💜,Positive
Loved them but one fell off & I lost it!,Positive
"This looked just as it did in the photos, and has added a cute, nautical look to our bathroom.",Positive

It is so sweet that people are gifting these polyamory symbol necklaces.,Positive
I love it! I am constantly asked where I got it.,Positive
It looks very well made and great!,Positive
Worked great for making the wax fruit loops in my fruit loops scented candle.  I would have given 5 stars if price was lower.  I thought it to be a bit over priced for the size.  I would have bought more because as you can see I needed to make about 6 different colors and that was time consuming.  In my opinion this should sell for about $5-$6 each or offer more quantities per order (3-4).,Positive
"I gave this to my son for his 44th birthday--he is a collector of rare bourbons, and he loved adding the barrel stave to his ""bourbon bar.""",Positive
This is my third or fourth buckle from Klamra. Each buckle has artwork on both sides. And the back is as awesome as the front. That attention to detail is extremely rare and an added value. The fact that mine are solid brass and made in Ukraine is also a big plus for me. But they also have styles is German silver and silver if you want to upscale.,Positive
Sturdy item,Positive
Very sturdy,Positive
I loved this! So neat and clean and perfect for my girls’ bathroom!,Positive
A most beautiful mask! Love the fabric and William Morris motif! Excellent quality! Thank you for such beautiful work!,Positive
Purchase several Different prints as Christmas gifts Looked great in frames The warmth of the paper and the vibrant photographic colors were quite Striking.. And the prices are Absolutely reasonable..,Positive
"I just wish it fit typical picture frames better, I had to put some colored construction paper behind the picture for it to fit, I think a typical 8x11 picture frame; but other than that it is super cute and we love it.",Positive
Love how these are plastic!,Positive
These pictures look fabulous on my walls. Well packaged and they look just like the picture.,Positive
Great quality. Arrived much faster than quoted. I LOVE that you can custom pick your colors!,Positive

"I ordered and received the 40” table legs within a few days. I installed them on a table top I salvaged from next to a dumpster and look forward to improving the project with paint when the weather gets nicer. After a full work day with some leaning, the welds are good and the steel is strong. The legs are sturdy enough to hold a medium-heavy table top with Macbook Air, two monitors, and multiple textbooks without wobbling. They look great for a stand-up table. Much nicer than fat, clunky wooden table legs.",Positive
2nd Anniversary Gift,Positive
Bought this as a gift for a friend who recently got a new hot tub. She loved it. It came out and was delivered exactly as expected.,Positive

"Awesome experience both times Hannah has made things for me! Great communication, quick shipping, amazing products!!",Positive
Beautiful products ...will order again,Positive
I love this hand made decoration. So cool on my tree. I bought two of her very cute and well made ornaments. The woman sells these hand made ornaments to help pay for her eleven rescue dogs so the money also went to a good cause. I am going to buy some for my daughter next Christmas!,Positive
Nice banner. Colors are bright and vibrant.,Positive
This crystal necklace is so beautiful!  Sparkles no matter which way you turn. Much prettier than any of my diamond necklaces.,Positive

"I bought a house recently and have slowly adorned my walls with meaningful art. I was delighted to discover Jason Smith's art on Amazon. Beautifully done, in colors and subjects that remind me of my years living in the Southwest.<br />Jason's prints are professional looking and well presented. The colors are lovely. I bought several different prints. Some have a whimsical, playful vibe while others have a deeper spiritual or mystical feel. I look forward to seeing more of Jason's work. The prints arrived well packaged and in a timely manner, often sooner than expected.",Positive

So glad I found this! My boyfriends birthday is coming up and we are huge Disney fans and we are going to be moving in together next month and I thought a way to commemorate our trip to Disney in October 2019 would be to have a picture of his favorite ride in our new house together.

I want it to really stand out when you walk in the door but all in all I’m happy with it and I really hope he likes it!,Positive

These were very nice - on great paper - look wonderful! Arrived as expected - no issues!,Positive

I was so worried about getting the personalized details right that when I typed the message I wanted I typed ""This is where is all began"" instead of  "" this is where it all began"". Seller immediately picked up on my error!! So the print arrived in four days, looked beautiful and when I presented it to my son and daughter-in-law, they loved it. Great gift!!",Positive
"Hard a rough time finding a record player table big enough for my tabletop record player. Finally found this and was not dissapointed. Great craftsmanship and it arrived safely and pre-assembled (except for the legs), but the pre-drill holes for the screws and included screws made it relatively easy to attach them.<br /><br />I would definitely look to buy from this business again!",Positive

The hardest part was getting the blue backing off. I absolutely love it! Pictures included. Oh and I got it a week earlier than expected so that’s a plus!,Positive
Nice product for the price. Easy to install. Hope it holds up well over time.,Positive
"Everything was great about this. It arrived 4 days or so after I ordered it. I must say cost of shipping was a little too much for an amazon prime member and wish there was no shipping at all but I understand. The only feedback can give to the maker is to all a set of screw selection just like the different size selection. This was sent with a set of two different screws. The long ones were perfect for the wall installation but the shorter ones were still too long for me and it would come out of our wooden shelf if I would have used. So after spending another 6$ for a whole box of screws at Lowe’s, keep in mind I only needed 4, my total came up to 25$ for the brackets and my purchased screws. This doesn’t break the bank for one shelf but quickly can get up there in price if you had to install few shelves, not even thinking about the cost of the shelf itself.",Positive
This decal is well made and beautiful I love it and it came in such lovely packaging thank you,Positive
Turned out great.  As expected,Positive

"Nothing to dislike about this coin ring jewelry. The design is time tested...one of the most popular coins the U.S. ever minted, the Buffalo-Native American nickel has been crafted into jewelry for decades. This particular offering is finely crafted and should last a lifetime. Its looks will enhance with age. I plan to add another ring from this artisans offerings.",Positive

Great price and good quality house numbers. Took longer to arrive due to Covid-19. But worth the wait! Company was a pleasure to communicate with. Easy to install. Drill two holes add a little epoxy glue and you’re good to go. Make sure you plan/measure your holes well to keep sign level.,Positive
"These aren’t going to work. I got the xxl for my son, which is so big that it chokes him when he gets it tight on his face. I blame myself for ordering the wrong size but they were way too expensive for me to have to eat it.",Positive
I have three children and loved this to represent each one of my little peas. It’s very small and dainty. I love it. The only thing to note is it sits on its side so you don’t always see the peas.<br />Love this.,Positive
"Perfect holiday gift for your best friend, Home Alone lover or not 🙂",Positive
"I carry a set of keys around work and I like to be equipped with the necessary crystals to keep my mind and soul at ease. There's a lot of negativity at work so I decided I really needed tourmaline to keep it at bay. A week later my ""enemy"" makes peace with me after trying to make my life hell for months. I still keep my eye on her, but it's a lot more relaxed in a way. Lol I'm a firm believer in crystal energy work so I will buy into them any day.",Positive
We framed and hung this picture in our nursery for our little chief,Positive
"These ship directly from the artist in Mexico, so be VERY patient with the shipping time. I bought two pairs that just arrived today and I am amazed by the quality. They are big and heavy and beautiful. Excellent customer service. I received a personal note from the seller apologizing for the delay. 100% satisfied and will purchase more of her designs in the future. (I'm placing the same review on the other style earrings I bought from her, so if you see it twice, I'm a real person, not a robot! LoL!)",Positive

This is the second tag I’ve purchased and I love them!  I have two small dogs (a new puppy in the pic) and the tiny tags are the perfect size. I especially appreciate being able to design the tag - it’s fun!  It’s a quality item and the turnaround is fast. Highly recommend this!!,Positive
Definitely giftable. I love opals suchva beautiful gem.,Positive
"Item is a print, but it is a print of one of the greatest films of the greatest love stories of all time. It arrived well packed in a cylindrical tube and wrapped. I put it in an appropriate sized frame and hung it in my hallway. My family and I have spent an inconceivable amount of time finding our favorite quotes from the film in it. And still I find more. If you have your favorite cult film or series, and this artist has word art for it, buy it, it is good work, sleep well, I will most likely buy more in the morning.<br /><br />I have more on the way. This is my idea of fine art.",Positive
These are amazing liners; Super cute and our guinea pigs love them! It's so nice not to buy bedding that has to be thrown away...really saves money and is so much nicer.,Positive
Beautiful. Paper quality far exceeds expectations. Looks great in frames. Just what I was looking for.,Positive

"This is a gift for a friend who loves alligators. It's perfect; great quality and size is accurate! It looks like it will hold up for quite a while. The chain is thick and sturdy but very nice. I love that the designer sent a personalized letter with &#34;how to's&#34; to keep the jewelry in the best of shape. It came on time as expected. Also, was included a business card on how to reach her. I would definitely recommend any of her jewelry to orhers and will be back to buy again in the future.<br /><br />Picture not included because it looks the same as the pics from seller.",Positive
"Immediately when I received this product I loaded it up with my Leatherman Signal and my Karas Kustoms EDK pen and boy I love the form fit. The pen was a little challenging to insert into the holder but once I got it worked in its no problem now getting it in and out. What surprised me is that my Leatherman Signal multitool went in with no big issue and believe it or not, the multitool goes in/out easier than the pen. As you can see in the photos its a really handsome setup.  This RUNT will patina well over time due to I use both my multitool and pen on a daily basis and handling the leather will help get it to that rustic look.  I order a bronze bead on a black lanyard for this setup and can't wait to see how it will add to the chracter of the RUNT.",Positive
"Bought a really nice frame, new in package at, Goodwill, believe it or not, and framed it for my office. Looks amazing! Lots of compliments and positive feedback.",Positive
"Note that stone appears to be closer in color to mystic topaz, definitely not alexandrite. Ring is large and appears to be well made.",Positive
Nice labels. Just what I needed.,Positive

Really beautiful authentic rose scent! Also not too oily for being a roll-on oil perfume. Strong scent for being natural too. Love it!,Positive
"I was so surprised to see this personalized product ship out the next day! The price point was perfect, I was skeptical that it would turn out in such good quality given the low price but it far exceeded my expectations. The inscription was  as described with no errors, and the engraving was deep and accurate enough to be legible from further away. The chain and vertical bar were of good quality, no chips or flaws in the metal were observed, even where the engraving was done. Now for the timing, the necklace was a gift for mothers day, although I planned further ahead than usual it was still only 6 business days prior. I came across this product and thought it was perfect but usually personalized jewelry takes several weeks so I was very pleased with the turn around time, but did not expect it as fast as it did. Gave me enough time to package nicely and send to its final destination. you can customize the length, type of material and of course the inscription to fit anyone's taste. This will definitely be a seller I will recommend and return to for future purchases.",Positive

Beautiful candle lovely to look at as it burns,Positive
"I love these. And would have given them 5 stars but there were no instruction for putting them on. I posted the question and got an answer saying you peal them off and  put them on one at a time. I am sure that that can't be right. And it turns out as I had thought, you warm them up with your hands and then they all come off on the sticky back together for easy placement. Then you just remove the film.",Positive
Beautiful craftsmanship and a wonderful way to express my faith and support for my Bluejays :),Positive

What beautiful prints!  Such a high quality paper and just absolutely gorgeous.  I picked up frames at Home Goods for $7 each and now they are ready to hang.  I am excited to have these hangings in my home to remind me of how important it is to be yourself and be strong always considering others.  Thank you for your art!  If you order - You will not be disappointed!!,Positive

Bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loved it..,Positive
My boyfriend and I have been slaving away on redoing our bathroom in our new home. I wanted to do a farmhouse industrial theme and these prints just made it all turn out great. I picked out all my decor and the boyfriend absolutely loves every piece especially the blueprints! These are amazing!! Could they be a little cheaper? Yes. Do I regret buying them? Absolutely not! The only reason these are getting 4 stars from me is the price. Nothing else.,Positive
So beautiful!!! LOVE IT!  Thank you,Positive
"I’m giving a full 5 star review even though it was my own fault for not paying attention to the sizing. The sign is ADORABLE and is exactly as pictured. It’s a piece that I bought for a prop, and I can’t wait to see it in action. I did think it was a tad bit bigger. More than an 8X10 size. Loved how fast it came! Def will be ordering again soon!",Positive

"It came well packaged.  It is larger than I expected, but still beautiful.  Great as a tree topper, and will probably hang it on the wall until next Valentine's day.  I would be careful with it, don't be too rough as the wire can be twisted, but otherwise durable enough.",Positive
This extremely well made! The craftsman obviously takes pride in their work! You will not be disappointed!,Positive
Love they are solar,Positive

I love the look of the distressed brown leather and can’t wait to see how it will look when broken in and combined with the oils of my hands. It also smells wonderful.",Positive

I received this for Christmas and had a issue with the handle after limited use.<br />Was very disappointed because the look and functionality of briefcase is exactly what I was looking for.<br />Got nothing but compliments and comments on how appealing this bag is.<br />The manufactured did reach back and has supported and resolved the issue.<br />I could not be more pleased with the  bag ...but more impressive is the service I received.<br />Highly recommend !!,Positive

"The opal is my birthstone.  I have several pendants and rings and love each and every one.  When I saw this on Amazon I was thrilled.  So simple and so beautiful.  I hoped that the opal bead would look half as good in person as in the picture.  When I opened the box I was amazed that it surpassed my expectations.  It is lovely and the simplicity of it sliding on the beautiful necklace is wonderful.  I believe this one may become my favorite necklace.  I would recommend this to everyone with one caution.  I live in Wisconsin, Wisconsin winters are not favorable to opals.  Always handle it carefully and keep it from the cold if you live where Winter shows it's icy head!",Positive
This shirt is really soft fits nice,Positive
You will be amazed at the positive difference this product makes. AMAZED!!!,Positive

"I absolutely LOVE this decal! It was fairly easy to put up & looks beautiful. I did it myself & didn't measure to center it. You can't see it well in the picture but the ""A"" is silver metallic and has a bit of glimmer to it. Out of all the decals I looked at, I'm so glad I chose to get this one! Fast shipping, too.",Positive
I love it!  Beautiful blue color and I even wear it backwards occasionally. When you flip it over the back of the cross has a neat pattern.,Positive
Got this for my laundry room. I bought a cheap light grey frame and it’s perfect in it.,Positive
"I thought this would look adorable on my mini Doxie, but her long snout easily reached the cute little dangle bead, and I could see a vet trip in her near future. (Let's not even talk about how long and how delayed the order was getting here in the first place!!)",Positive
Very pretty lilacs.  Realistic looking photo.,Positive
"The earrings are beautiful and very well constructed. The color and design are accurately portrayed in the picture. The earrings are not too heavy but I do recommend getting the ear stoppers if you’re an active person or have long hair. Also, the seller is very nice and helpful.",Positive
I was looking for botanical prints that were simple versus the old vintage looking ones. These are perfect and add beauty to the living room!,Positive

Fabulous! My granddaughter was thrilled with her cake topper!,Positive
"These shirts were beautiful and so soft. Held up after many uses, and we are still using them. Very vibrant colors, and no peeling or cracking of the print, though I do wash them inside out. Got them for my daughter and son to wear for Easter and they were exactly what I was hoping for.",Positive
Love it please make more rings size 7.75. Fits perfect.,Positive
This is great when you have a not bowl of anything.  Prevents one from getting burned or dropping bowl because it too hot.  Love it.,Positive

A little difficult for my grandson to comprehend was a little bit foggy on the ink other than that great product.,Positive

Stenciling a display case for Norweigen history items.,Positive
Love the saying,Positive

This item was very nice and I enjoyed reading it,Positive
Came a lot earlier than expected! Wonderful craftsmanship. I’m very happy with my order and I know my son will be also!,Positive
I love my ring. It's exactly how I wrote the names. Couldn't be any happier with it. I wear it with my wedding rings and looks great!,Positive
She loved it,Positive
They are lightweight and well made.  The base appears to be wood?  With resign?  The design is well made and color is done well.  The backs are good quality.,Positive
Had a little issue with the original ring. It was replaced with a great ring. Very happy.,Positive
The cup came out perfectly and arrived early as well. Can’t wait to give it as a Mother’s Day gift 🥰🥰🥰,Positive
Excelente,Positive
These are very dainty and the perfect diameter for me. Very well made.<br />All the people having problems with the shape warping are not opening them right.<br />You don't pull the ends straight apart. Set it on a table and use needle-nose pliers to pull one side up towards you while holding the other side flat on the table.<br />Then use 2 pairs of pliers to push the sides back into place once it's inserted.,Positive
Love it so much!,Positive
Awesome product love it,Positive
Very good quality pendant! I've seen many pendants that symbolize weigh lifting. Most of those are cheap looking. This one is perfect! I'm very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing from you again! Thanks!!!!,Positive
"These are perfect for the wall I wanted to decorate in my bathroom. They are very affordable and I just bought cheap $2 frames and popped them in. It turned out way cute! I know you could probably print these yourself, but I did not have that font (and I love it) and they used super good quality card stock. So for me it was easier and cheaper just to order from Amazon.",Positive
So adorable! Great quality item.,Positive
"Just what I wanted! As people said, shipping can be slow compared to prime, but actually got it way earlier than the estimated range, so that's a win. Thanks!",Positive
Bought this for my 17 yr old grandson and he loves it.  Carries it with him everywhere.  Shows it off to everyone he knows.,Positive
it’s the perfect size,Positive
I bought this for my youngest son for Christmas. The saying is exactly what I would want him to know but something I could never put into words myself. I bought a nice black wooden frame for it and it came out looking beautiful! I'm sure it's a gift he will always treasure from me.,Positive
My husband's favorite quote. Absolutely love it. Thank you for the added hearts it was a nice touch.,Positive
"Although Mr Lentz just recently started selling items on Amazon, I've had my wallet for 7 months now, and absolutely love it.<br /><br />The &#34;western brown&#34; leather is developing a wonderfully rich and dark patina. My only wish is that I could have had the option to order it with brass rivets instead of (what I presume to be) stainless steel or nickel that they come with.  The inside of the wallet still has a mostly original color to when I received the wallet, and you can see the outside cover has gotten significantly darker.<br /><br />If you're like me, I tend to only replace my wallet after many, many years of use. The stitching starts to blow out or it develops a wear-hole. I wanted to buy a wallet that didn't have stitching so it couldn't fray, and with a much higher grade of leather that wouldn't wear out as quickly (if at all). Note to the uninformed, &#34;Genuine Leather&#34; is a grade of leather that is second to the bottom in terms of quality. This is made from a single piece of full grain leather and is, in my humble opinion, a very high quality item that I expect will last a very long time.",Positive
Awdome,Positive
I was looking for an appropriate ornament for to mark the first Christmas home for my little guy (adopted internationally). It arrived quickly and I love it! I did have both of his names put on it (the name from me plus his Chinese name) and while it was a tight squeeze it still looks great!,Positive
Exactly what we wanted,Positive
Just what i expected. Was excited to get the images for my sons playroom and i was not disappointed ❤😁,Positive

The fit great!,Positive
"Light weight, durable  & looks great. Good price with engraving! Very happy with this purchase!",Positive

I love that it’s customizable and it looks awesome when it’s lit up, plus the color option patterns are endless. I will recommend this to any of my friends that are looking for an exceptional gift!!",Positive
"This bracelet is excellently made!  I actually just replaced my first one after wearing it for 3 years.  I do a lot of outdoor activities and it help up really well.  The black does fade over time, which is to be expected with cotton, especially considering going into pools and hanging out in the sun.<br />All I can say is it surpassed my expectations exceptionally!  Will definitely be buying another one in 3 more years 😁👍",Positive
High quality patches. Beautiful designs and worksmanship.,Positive
"My mom loved it, so I got one for the MIL too-she loves it as well. Shipped in a day or two-they have to be made first! Very nice personalized piece.",Positive

These are great pictures. If your looking for something different then you found your spot.,Positive
"It's summer, so I wanted to find an anklet that's cute but doesn't break the bank.  I love the one I got and have had it a few months and have never taken it off.  It is very durable and well made.  I will definitely be back for more.  The only con of it (that idk if the anklet industry has an answer for) is the excess strings that are left after  you tighten it.  I would prefer one that you tie and doesn't have the option to loosen, but it is nice to have the option to take if off if you want.",Positive
"WOW. I absolutly love this ring! So beautiful, the moonstone itself is gorgoeus!! Color galore! I ordered 2. Best ring I ever owned!",Positive
Perfect cup at work and keeps my drinks cold!,Positive
Fast shipping. As advertised. Only thing was the application was a little more difficult than other decals I have bought and it tried to stick to the paper. Once I got it on it was amazing!,Positive
Love,Positive
"As described, I like it, thank you",Positive
"My daughter dressed as a character from ""Stranger Things"" for a party, this patch made it super authentic",Positive
"Bought this as a xmas gift for my sister, then one for myself! I love how dainty the chain and charm are but that the compass still has a kinetic factor (the dial spins from the center axis). Very delicate, sturdy, but fun to play with. Also came with a small swatch of polishing cloth so you can remove the oxidation for more of a gleam or leave it to enhance the details.",Positive
We love them.  They have a lovely pattern and the three sizes give options for just about anything we throw in the microwave.  Also really good for a cold bowl of ice cream!,Positive
My chain.,Positive
"These twist earrings are adorable. They look great, are comfortable to sleep in, and I haven't had any  reactions to the metal. The earrings were packaged with great care, and came with a lovely box, and instructions. I'll be visiting this seller's shop again.",Positive
This is a lovely print...exactly as shown!,Positive
It is very nice but the price is high.,Positive
"This decoration is very pretty, good quality, and looks good on my walls! Would recommend!",Positive

Got here earlier than expected<br />and in great condition!,Positive
As a professional chef having the right equipment is key to success. Not only is it beautiful but it makes perfect tortillas every time. I also use it for Chinese pancakes and flour tortillas with a quick roll of a rolling pin you are good to go. I have it on display in my kitchen and gave one to my son for his 30th birthday. Highly recommend!,Positive

This necklace is STUNNING! I was super pleased with quality. Unlike many necklaces that are lightweight and cheap this one has weight and catches the light perfectly.

I wish they’d make earrings to match. ❤️❤️❤️,Positive

"I thoroughly recommend this necklace to anyone looking for a chain they can shower with, sweat in and enjoy. I was desperate to find a necklace I didn't have to take on and off everyday, but I didn't want to pay for an expensive gold chain. This item seemed a little too good to be true at first, but I took stock of the amazing reviews and took a chance.<br /><br />I made the right move.<br /><br />I love, love, loooove this necklace. The only 'downside' is that the letter etched into the metal is a little faint for my tastes, but that's not a big deal breaker. For the price, this necklace is a great buy!",Positive
Love it!,Positive
I don’t know why there are bad reviews but these peeled perfectly and were very cute! Great quality and value for the price.,Positive
Nice,Positive
Beautiful! Love it so much. Thank you! Fast shipping!,Positive

"My second bar of Bay Rum soap from this seller. Oh my goodness..I love this stuff. The smell is fantastic, it doesn’t dry out my hands, and it doesn’t get soft or gunky if you leave it on a soap drain. 5 stars all around for the seller and their product! I will definitely buy more from this seller/brand!",Positive

Bought for my baby’s nursery. It’s a really pretty print. I love the colors.,Positive
"I love these firefly lights!!! 😍<br />It arrived inside a small box, neatly organized, and I turned it on and tested it. The lights have mutiple functions depending on how you want to use it (whether flickering like a fairy in a jar, fading in and out around the corners of the room for a more romantic feel, plus more) and very easy to setup. Mine even came with batteries so I could use them right away!!! I've had so many uses for this since I got it, very delicate but pretty lights even in the background it served for great sparkles to my photos.",Positive
"I won't lie....it's overpriced for what it is. Realistically, the only reason it's priced so high is simply because they can.<br /><br />With that out of the way, it's a nice little addition to our son's elf family. First we had one elf. He kept asking if his elf would ever get married, so the next year the girlfriend made an appearance, followed by a wedding. Then our son kept telling us he was excited because now that they're married, they'll have a baby. So of course I had to go looking for a baby elf. There are other baby elves available, but they're more like toddlers, and when a well-meaning relative sent us a couple of them, they showed up with their heads permanently dented in due to super thin plastic. So this was by far the best option. It's just a baby head glued into a little stuffed bag, but it works. Made my son incredibly happy, so I suppose it's worth paying 4x to 5x times its actual worth. To be fair, all of the elf dolls are overpriced. I don't understand it, but that's okay...it's giving my son happy childhood memories, and those are priceless.",Positive
I framed this in black and the contrast makes it really stand out.  I just wish it were a little larger than 8x10.  It looks beautiful on my office wall and I love seeing the Bible verse every day.,Positive
Muy bonita,Positive
I liked the words on the cards. Very helpful.,Positive
"Here is what the recipient of the gift said. ""It's the photo of a beauceron from the French breed club's web site. (that's the breed of my fancy french dog). I wanted everyone to see how truly and awe-inspiringly thoughtful my SS gift really is.""",Positive
Love the colors! I thought the flowers (petals?) were an orange or coral but they're closer to the pink shades. I'm not normally a pink girl but I like this strap. Fit on my shiny new Canon T6. Really spruced it up and got a compliment on it while on my camera's inaugural trip to Watkin's Glen State Park. I had no fear of the strap slipping and the construction seems like quality and should last a long time.,Positive
Awesome! It’s beautiful thanks!,Positive
"Shirt was very cute and perfect for our forest animal birthday party. Shirt is super soft which I was not expecting, but is an added bonus! I definitely would recommend!",Positive

"I really like the overall look of the brackets.  We are using them for floating shelves on a tiled backsplash/wall.  (Installing through the tile into the studs wasn't easy, but that has nothing to do with the brackets themselves.)  Overall, very happy!",Positive
"[[VIDEOID:32e9f03bca55e0e24c23e0e50c39dfce]] I took the hook, straightened it then folded in half, like a hair pin to where the end of it was even with the bottom circle.<br /> This enables me to make an adjustable height clip on the side of a container. I can adjust the height of the wick to the level of oil.<br /><br />SAFETY NOTE see vid FAR MORE SECURE! They way I hacked it it's not going to move unless somebody deliberately moves it. That's real important with oil candles",Positive
It was perfect. We even used the shirt for signatures.<br /><br />Size they did run big.,Positive

Makes me feel good,Positive
"While they are slightly larger then anticipated, I still love them. They are intriguingly beautiful.",Positive
"This was such a fun gift from my husband. I know I will enjoy them when winter comes. They fit well, except for the sleeve band, which can be a little snug if you try to pull it all the way down your arm. If you keep them up near your wrists, it works well.",Positive
"Used for centerpieces. Love them, so cute!",Positive
"What a beautiful, sparkling necklace! I love it! I bought more than just one! :)",Positive
Given as a gift and she loved it.,Positive
Well made and arrived fast. Can’t wait to give it to my friend- she loves sloths.,Positive
"I bought these for my 4 year old son to get him excited about bath time and they worked like a charm. The scents were fun, although some of them smelled pretty similar and the LEGOs inside were awesome. They are a little pricey and kind of difficult to open without getting some of ball on yourself of counter but I would still recommend them",Positive
This is beautiful !! We love it !!,Positive
At first I was really worried about this purse matching the shoe that I already have but I received it yesterday and is absolutely just as beautiful the only thing I need to do now is get my pink and purple paper<br />So if you want to get more than one item and are worried about it matching don't worry they will match exactly !!! LOVE LOVE LOVE,Positive
"I got these as a puzzle for my niece to play with. Then, when she outgrows it, we can hang it as a sign on her door or wall. It came out even better than I thought it would, and I had some pretty high expectations. She loves playing with the different letters with the different colors (she hasn’t quite realized they are meant to be put back in order but keep sorting them by color). Honestly I would buy this again for any new baby in the family.",Positive
"[[VIDEOID:b36565717704edded6f7f42064a91fe0]] This was AMAZING!!!! GREAT BUTTER SLIME!!! Very soft and nice and perfect quality slime.

"These beautiful pinecone earrings were a special gift for my granddaughter’s mother! My granddaughter is 5.5 yrs. old and has always loved pinecones! Ever since she was old enough to walk, she loved to go outside and find the nicest ones to give big or small for just about any reason but especially if you were sad or sick! Not only did you get a pinecone but you got an I love you with a great big hug!<br />We have never understood why a pinecone; however, it didn’t matter because it was so heartfelt and meant so much! To this day her mom and I each have a basket of every pinecone she has ever given to us! It is just her M.O.<br />When her mother opened the gift; she cried!",Positive

"Love this bag and using it daily since early this year. The description said it’s genuine leather. Not sure if it really is, but it’s aging like a leather would and the color has darkened a bit and the bag shows beautiful leather like wear and it still has some material odor inside, which doesn’t bother me. For the quality and price I got a Big Bang for the buck! Would buy again.",Positive
"Love it, it was a nice size and looks beautiful",Positive
"I like this hand towel,  it's beautiful and absorbent.",Positive

I have made only 3 shields so far, and I'm tired (or at least my arm is) of beating metal into a boss. I have several requests to build family shields and will be ordering soon! I'll post pictures as I get them built.",Positive
Very cute!  My mother-in-law who is into quilting loved it!,Positive
Product arrived unexpectedly quickly.  Arrived in excellent condition.  Wonderful small business touches as others have mentioned.  The toy itself is excellently made.  We've discovered a few different ways to use it.  Can't decide whether I like the smaller one or the bigger one (have small hands).  Has both sound and touch qualities which make it great if you need it for self-soothing.  Great job folks!,Positive
"I anticipate using it each year, as my daughter continues her education. Might be nice to have a spot for school name (?) Otherwise, I love it. :-)",Positive
"First off I have to say, I am a huge Bay Rum scent fan. And a plug for a local artisan here in Montana. All of that aside, this aftershave has become one of my favorite Bay Rum scented aftershaves. It leaves my skin feeling so good. I won't comment on the ingredient because I don't want to get them wrong. But it does not have the sharp bite that alcohol-based aftershaves have. It just goes on smooth, leaves your skin feeling amazing, and has a scent that stays with you all day long. I will definitely buy it again and try other scents from this artisan.",Positive
Soooooo cute! I thought about making my own- so glad I didn’t! These are adorable!,Positive
"Able to smell this one, nice scent.",Positive
"I've spent MONTHS searching for a necklace that is able to be worn everyday. The length is always a problem for me because I like long necklaces. This skeleton key is PERFECT in every way! I love that it looks worn and older. I LOVE the length! I love that the seller wrote a handwritten Thank You on my receipt! It was just the most pleasant of experiences from finding it, ordering it, thinking it would take about a week to get and then IT WAS IN MY MAILBOX TWO DAYS LATER!<br />Honestly, I couldn't be happier with this piece. The Key, the chain, the style. It's all just great!",Positive
Great customer service communication was very quick and they were exactly what we wanted. Highly recommend!,Positive

Beautiful !!! Incredible craftship,Positive
"I ordered this for my dad for Christmas. He needed something to keep his phone, wallet, keys, watch and glasses in one place on his desk. He was excited that it has his name engraved on it when it arrived. It was a little confusing putting it together but with the pictures on the booklet, it's a sturdy wood organizer. Would definitely buy again!",Positive
"Well made in the Shaker tradition, prompt delivery.",Positive
"When I received the order, my daughter's name was spelled incorrectly.  I did not put in a complaint because it is so close to Christmas.  To my surprise on Christmas eve, I received a package and it was a new decal with my daughter's name spelled correctly.  Thank you so much!!!  She is going to love it.",Positive
Awesome !  Perfect for our wedding,Positive
"Stunning workmanship.  The dark antique finish is just amazing and all the phrases, such as LIBERTY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN GOD WE TRUST and 1969 are clearly visible.",Positive
"Was given this by my granddaughter & even though not something I would have picked for myself, I ended up loving the stylish feel - kind of updated this grandmothers ‘look’!  I find myself wearing it almost everyday now!m",Positive
I purchased this for my sons’ new kitten. At 12 weeks we finally put her collar on and the tag is beyond perfect. Thank you so much!,Positive
Great banner.  The material used to make product is also water proof and convenient for all weather type.,Positive

Loved this product! Gave as a house gift and was very well received!  Will be ordering two additional for bridal shower gifts !!,Positive
"I love these seaglass earrings with the handmade knot. I ordered the blue.  Fine craftsmanship, lightweight, very beautiful.",Positive
Love this. It looks exactly as expected. It actually came before it was expected by almost a week. The cord seems longer than I thought it would but thats fine because I know there will be enough. Definitely worth the money.,Positive
Beautiful,Positive
"We love our newest ornament! This is our second Christmas in our new home, so glad we found this! Excellent quality and beautifully made!",Positive

"Lovely, cute, well-crafted. Love them :-)",Positive
"I like that this one has no discernible scent for those who are sensitive to fragrance. Their scented products are great though! It foams up well and has the wonderful, detoxifying charcoal in it! I would definitely repurchase this.",Positive
"The 16"" Metal Circle Monogram with Name arrived exactly as I expected, and it arrived early!  The shipping was extremely quick, especially considering this is a custom order.  I read prior reviews about some of the metal edges being rough and sharp, so I expected that; the sharp edges were mostly on the curved letters and the more intricate parts of the design.  There were not nearly as many sharp edges as I expected, but that is the reason for four stars instead of five.  If I had ordered this before reading other reviews, I would have been slightly upset, but when thinking about the manufacturing process for a piece of metal... well, one should expect some sharp edges!<br />The monogram will hang on my front door and I am likely to order from this company in the future.  Overall, I am very pleased and am considering for using this item as gifts in the future!  The items looks professional and classy.  It will make a nice addition to my front door décor!  Thank You!",Positive
Beautiful ring,Positive
I bought these as a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves these soapstone hippos! They're very nicely done and worth every penny!,Positive
Gave it as a Christmas gift and my uncle loved it,Positive

Wife Loves it!,Positive
"I have been looking for pillows two coordinate with my other blue and green salad pillows, these are perfect! They are definitely outdoor pillow material… I originally bought these for inside but I’m using them outside because of the material. I still love them wish I could find the same pattern in an interior fabric.",Positive
Wonderful product! Highly recommend!,Positive
For someone who likes hippos.  This was a unique item. Great color. Will order more.,Positive
I really like the ring. It’s comfortable. I bought it for my thumb. I can get it over my knuckle and it will fit nicely in the slimmer part past my knuckle. What I don’t like is it has gotten a bit bent when the end got caught on something. It gets caught on things easily. It will get caught in hair when I hug someone. Because of that I haven’t worn it as often as I thought I would.,Positive
This was great a great shirt but must have been folded hot bc I can’t get the lines out of the ears. Been washed twice and pressed with an iron and still won’t come out.<br />I had lots of complements on how cute it is and I loved the glitter. It was perfect for my Disney trip!,Positive
"Well made product, fits nicely on my dog's collar.",Positive
Perfect! Great quality. Super fast shipping too! Thank you ;),Positive

A mi niña le quedo perfecto,Positive
Great quality! Packaged well and super easy to install. I ordered two as spice shelves and the 14&#34; fit about 8 regular sized spice jars each. Invisible mounting system so they are flush against the wall.,Positive
"I just absolutely LOVE my key chains. The pennies arrived nice and shiny-in mint condition and looked amazing.<br />After a few months of use, the penny has dulled some which is to be expected with hand oils coming into contact with it and just regular wear and tear. The most important part is that the dates look perfect and unchanged.<br />The O rings are good quality and because of that, I don't have to worry about the penny coming off.<br />Shipping was fast and they came in an adorable little gift bag inside of the box.<br />A lovely idea and wonderfully executed. I highly recommend this item and this seller!",Positive
My kids have dropped this and my phone is protected. It hold money and cards.<br /><br />Change is hard to keep in there but we ie it so rarelynits not that big of Ann issue.,Positive
"Large and fluffy, washes beautifully, received item quickly",Positive

Cute as a button!  This is like my forth pair of these in just a few months. I have sensitive piercings and can't wear a lot of earrings.  I can wear these all day and not be bothered.  The designs are super cute.  I already have another pair in the cart.,Positive
"Beautiful work - detailed, colorful, bright, and lovely! These make my child's room pop! I put them in cute pink frames and they make the pictures stand out well.",Positive

"I had each of my grandkids give a silver ring with their name on it, to their Mom for Mother's Day.  Also, I had their dates of birth engraved inside the rings.  When the rings were delivered, I was extremely pleased with the quality and beauty of them.  Though they were small and dainty, each name was clearly readable, including the birth dates inside.  The boys proudly presented these to their Mom and she was delighted!  She hasn't taken them off since!  I highly recommend this craftsperson.  The rings were quickly created and delivered and everything was perfectly done.",Positive
"Purchased this for my A5 *Carpe Diem* planner. Fits perfectly. Each page has a two column section for a grocery list on the front, and on the back it has a menu planner for all 7 days, plus space for notes and meal prep reminders. The grocery list is lined and has a &#34;check off&#34; box for when it's added to your shopping cart. Nice, quality paper and easy to read font. It will be very useful to have everything on one piece of paper. The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is I think they could have included a lot more sheets for the price. Pretty expensive for what you get.",Positive
Great gift for the teachers at my kid's school! :-),Positive
Tried this after doing some research on natural skin cancer treatments and have to say I am seeing a visible reduction in the size of the tumor that was growing on my hand. Can't say it will eliminate it but defintely seeing it shrink!!,Positive
Awesome book! Bought it for our son's birthday. The way the letters of his name were incorporated into the story and illustrations made it an excellent purchase. A little pricey but worth it.,Positive
I run my business out of a van for mobile repairs. When I have to put my hot dewalt heat gun back it fits nice and snug on this bracket and away from melting other surfaces. Great little organizational unit.,Positive
"My granddaughter loves ballet dancing so this seemed a perfect birthday gift. I also bought another dancer necklace but it seems more fragile so am saving that for another year or so. Along with the dancer, she likes having the first initial of her name.",Positive
For my new baby granddaughter.,Positive

very nice,Positive
this product works great.,Positive
"It’s cute and a nice idea. However it’s hard to put on, take off and charge. I get dressed quickly in the morning so this doesn’t fit into my quick lifestyle.",Positive

Well made and looks great on my sons wall,Positive
These look great in our daughters room,Positive
Very nice!,Positive
These buttons were so beautifully made!  Perfect placement and excellent quality. I was so excited I ordered another product they are selling and their customer service was awesome in helping me get exactly what o wanted. No hesitation ordering from them many times again. This is perfect for my crochet items!  Thank you!!,Positive
I ordered this for myself as a lightning deal... arrived timely... and I was pleasantly surprised at how pretty this ring is! It is comfy to wear- I never take any of my toe rings off. Doesn't catch on anything and is quite sturdy. I was not expecting such a high quality piece & I would totally repurchase.,Positive
I only gave 4 stars because there was some trouble and it had to go back a couple of times but the product is GREAT LOOKING and I am very happy with it. I would buy another.,Positive
"This decal is super easy to apply, and has stayed on my two littles water bottles very well even through daily washing. I just ordered a second set for my older kiddo and myself for our water bottles.",Positive
I love these so much! And the seller is amazing. They really make quality products and care about their customers.,Positive
"I like the sticker but it's much smaller than I expected. They obviously show a large sticker on the picture, which is probably around $11.00.<br />I think the one I got was a little too pricy for the size of it.",Positive
"This is a lovely bracelet. Right on target for price versus weight. It’s a little on the larger side for me (I bought the small/medium size), but I only have a 6” wrist so most bracelets tend to be oversized. It’s very shiny and has great detail. I also like the clasp on it. It was a good purchase.",Positive
Simple yet Very nice.,Positive
Beautiful work with extra surprises!,Positive
Well done! Very modern and chic... love it!,Positive
It's as expected. Love the vibe,Positive
We were so impressed when we received this. It is beautiful and my mom started crying. She said it looked just like our Taz. We couldn’t be more pleased.,Positive

"With good vision except for reading, this lovely ""necklace"" is so useful as I dash about, then suddenly need to check the small print, e.g., read a label, an expiration date,  etc.  This ""necklace"" is so easy to wear, co-ordinates fine with my sweat pants but the extra nice thing is that it comes with so much Good Will from the Artist.  As others have said, this item makes a lovely gift for anyone who needs a little help with reading, but doesn't want to always be rummaging through a back-pack for their close-up glasses.  FIVE STARS!",Positive
I love how fast it was shipped and the over all look of the topper.. it looks beautiful!,Positive
"This dainty ring is very cute and comfortable! It also shipped super fast!! My only complaint is that some of my letters were black and others weren’t. I’m not sure why some were missing the ink (the L’s in the middle)... it didn’t bother me enough to return it, but I probably wouldn’t order more for that price just because I’m not sure how long it will be legible. Hopefully it lasts!",Positive

Ordered this noodle board for my sister. It arrived timely and she loves it! Great quality and looks great on her stove. Would recommend this item and this seller.,Positive
This is such a super cute sign and the attachments are perfect. However read the size carefully! It is small and not the tall one like I prefer. It's my fault I didn't pay attention to the measurements however I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. I still keep this on my front porch however it is hard to see because it is so short and small.,Positive
It looks great and others often notice it.,Positive
"The earrings are awesome and look exactly like the picture and description. However, as usual my package, this time for a birthday present, is ALWAYS DELAYED. Seems to me like it is AMAZON's fault, NOT THE SELLER, because every time I order something for a special occasion my package is ALWAYS DELAYED.",Positive
My 2-year old grandson loves this outfit.  It suits him perfectly!,Positive
We have two lamps in our home connected by internet to 2 lamps in Costa Rica where our 2 granddaughters live and 2 lamps in Iowa where our 2 grandsons live. Several times a day one of our grandchildren will touch their lamps and send their love. We recognize which grandchild communicated by the color that appears on our lamps. We then return the love by touching that lamp that changed color.,Positive

I loved these prints! Exactly what I was looking for to hang in my kitchen. Great colors.,Positive
"[[VIDEOID:4a6a5c8ac76d0c8a17b93a7889c4e058]] Loved the decal. What I would say, is that it looked like someone had printed it from their personal computer because of the way it came packaged, but idc honestly, it still looked great. I will say that it was my first time doing a decal and it came out beautifully on my daughter’s mirror. Idk why they asked about the sheerness, but it’s definitely solid black. No sheerness to it. Perfect decal! I cut it in half to make it closer to the bottom since we had a skinny oval mirror. I would’ve went right accord if the mirror was larger. But still beautiful 😻",Positive

"Very pretty, good quality. Got this as a gift for someone who loves sand dollars and can't wait to see her face when she opens it. It is really pretty.<br />This gift was given and absolutely loved by receiver.",Positive
I didn't like the fact that my package was thrown over the fence where it got soaking wet. It should have been put on the porch.,Positive
"I had a bit of trouble with the first shipment, but the seller worked with me and resolved the issue. I love the necklace and it is perfect.  Will buy other items in the future!",Positive
"I've been looking for small hostess gifts to take with me on a trip overseas this Fall and literally stumbled across these soaps the other day. I couldn't have asked for more! They're the perfect size to carry in my backpack (see my photo with penny for size comparison) and delightfully scented -- fragrant but not overwhelmingly so. Each of the six plastic bags contains two bars, one on top of another, for a total of 12 bars.<br /><br />I did have a small problem when placing the order as I couldn't select more than one scent at a time as indicated, but Shawn from Homespun Goods replied to my query straightaway, saying to just message them my choices after I placed my order. That happened on Sep 14 and they arrived today, Sep 17 -- super fast. Shawn even included a personal thank you note and a few extra bars in the package. Sweet, I get to try one myself, too! If it's anything less than wonderful I'll update my review. :-) As it is I'm very impressed and grateful I found Homespun Goods. Thank you, Shawn!",Positive
"Great for a thoughtful handmade gift as it has such pretty packaging. I just discovered plastic posts they are perfect for my allergy to metal, I can wear them all day and forget they're there.",Positive
This is beautiful. I love it. Very detailed. Took a little bit to receive it but worth the wait,Positive
The prints-I got three-are unique and well done.,Positive
I like it so much. The font and material are soooo rich and love it and my son too<br />Thanks,Positive
"I saw Yoolie's jewelry in a store in Ithaca a year ago and have been kicking myself ever since for not buying any.  Then I got a gift card from Amazon for a thank you at work and wanted to buy myself something nice, and not just apply it to an autoship or something!<br /><br />I was shocked and thrilled to learn Yoolie's jewelry is carried on Amazon.  It is all so beautiful and unique.  And despite how it looks the necklace is very light and comfortable.  I could not be happier!",Positive
Perfect,Positive
Love the pants do they come in other colors?,Positive
It was beautiful ! And I like the different options you have to wear it!,Positive
These are perfect! Durable but fashionable and I never know I'm wearing one. Thank you!,Positive
"Just what I anticipated. Look good, nice length.",Positive
It takes a while to get them as they are custom made. If you’re you’re willing to wait to get amazing  craftsmanship and brackets that are super heavy duty and look amazing then I would definitely get these.  I originally bought brackets at a craft store in the neighborhood and there’s no comparison.<br />I’ve attached a few photos.,Positive
Absolutely beautiful quality of craftsmanship is there!,Positive
"I love this product , I only wish they would make more choices . They turn plain shoes into a cute option!",Positive
The quality of the cover is amazing.,Positive
"I was cautious to order as a previous review said there was a line running though the blue butterfly, but they apparently have fixed that issue. They are beautiful and on quality photo paper. Exactly what I was looking for to complete my kitchen!",Positive
They’re very pretty!! Definitely worth the price. I took 2 of them & put them in white frame. Looks great!,Positive
Looks great on the chicken coop!,Positive
Grest,Positive

"it was exactly I had hoped it to be, a picture worth framing for the guest bathroom.",Positive
Well received gift,Positive
These earrings are beautiful! The color is exactly as shown. I especially like that this jewelry is handcrafted. My order came with a hand written thank you from the business owner. That personal touch really impressed me.  I'll be sure to shop with them again!,Positive
Items arrived on time and were packaged very well.  Prints are very pretty and modern with vivid colors.  A word of caution:  the ink will smudge!  Handle the prints only by the corners and make sure your hands and frames are completely dry.  The ink smudged on the light beige background on one of my prints while I was framing so I hung the smudged print higher than eye level.  Thankfully the smudge is not visible to others unless one looks closely at the print.<br /><br />UPDATE: Customer service is excellent.  They offered to replace the smudged print for free.  Thank you again!,Positive
a tiny bit goes a loooooooong way. love it thank you,Positive

"The turn-around on this personalized order was terrific! Just 2 days! And everything was correct.  My granddaughter needed these for starting school and I was told about it at the last minute.  She started today and everything is labeled.  they say they go through the dishwasher so we'll see.  I didn't get the ones for clothing but will if we have a need.  Other types were saying 2 weeks or so for delivery.  And so many choices of pictures, fonts and colors.  I would definitely buy again.",Positive
We got these for our 35th anniversary! We both LOVE them! Great conversation starters! Nice Engraving and Comfortable,Positive
"I think these earrings are darling; I chose them from my daughter's Amazon Wish List for Christmas, so I don't know yet how she likes them, but since she chose them for her list, I'm sure she will.",Positive
I &#34;love&#34; this item. Great accent on chosen wall. Would buy again.,Positive
What a great gift this is! There is a similar one at urban outfitters but this looks exactly the same and has that homemade touch. The frame keychain is very cute and makes my keys a great conversation starter :) excellent gift!,Positive
Will add to my wall on deck.  So cute!,Positive
Gorgeous.  I wear it constantly.  It goes great with work and casual.  I even bought more from this vendor because I loved it so much.,Positive
"This is exactly what I wanted in a hoop. Noticeable, thin, real gold, small hoop circumference so it doesn’t stick out to far from my nostril and comfortable to wear. It is so cute!!! I really hope I don’t get into a job that does not allow nose rings cause I love mine so much.",Positive
This little spoon holder for my daughter’s coffee station was a perfect match for her Sophie Conran collection.,Positive
Perfect fit and super cute! My 1 year old excidedly giggled at and rubbed his hands over the spiderman pattern. Highly recommend.,Positive
I ordered a custom bottle for a gift and was really happy with the quality.  I would definitely order again. Thank you!,Positive
"Bamboo is a nice addition...Wish they had used more cotton in the mix of materials, but these are still a great pair of socks. LOVE the tie dye coloring!",Positive
My fiancé loved it. Came earlier than expected and really sturdy.,Positive
Great quality.  Got this as a gift for my boyfriend and framed it.  Looks amazing!,Positive

Loved the vinyl so much that I have 3 more on the way❤️,Positive
Very pretty and does the job.,Positive
"This is truly special to me as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  I saw this and HAD to have it!  My mother in law is getting married and since this was our theme for our 2019 International Convention, I had to order it as a gift for her.  I know she will love it as much as I do!  That was our last convention before Covid, and she was able to attend it as well.  I even wrote a poem with the same title!",Positive
I received my prints and they are just what I expected. Super high quality and they look great. I cannot wait to frame and hang them!!! Hey,Positive
"Sizing was perfect. The stone is a bit smaller than I had thought, but probably bc I have larger hands and needed a bigger size than daintier fingers! That's my fault for not looking at the measurements closely. Really nice ring though!",Positive
The Party Chick was very flexible when we needed to redo our programs for an unexpected addition. The guests all thought they were beautiful and of course functional as it was a little warm for a July afternoon wedding. I highly recommend them for your event needs!,Positive
Great minimalist ring,Positive
"I like to fidget but couldn't figure out what a good fidget option is for me. I LOVE this little thing! I bought a small one and I have large hands so I am going to also buy a large one, too. This one will be great for my purse to carry when I'm waiting somewhere and just needing to fiddle with something on the go. But I can't believe how satisfying this is for my hands. I bought the standard weave and I was kind of worried that there might be some difficulty moving them around, but there isn't at all!  Personally, I don't think I'd want to have a more loose weave as there is enough room to spin the individual rings or to sort of push them around one another- for me, I feel like one less ring would make this too loose and not as easy to quietly manipulate.  They don't seem to lock together at all and it is nice and quiet. Also, I don't have that metallic-ey smell on my hands. I am so happy I found these.",Positive
These prints are exactly what I needed for my guest room. I love that you can choose what size suits your space best. Perfect! 👌,Positive
"Very impressed with quality, easy to customize front and back ! Easy to assemble. Ordered, shipped, and received within a few days. Thank you!",Positive

These earrings are so elegant.  Perfect length with just the right amount of shimmer.,Positive
Very professionally made,Positive
 ,Positive
Worth it. It was on my wishlist but it always felt so expensive. Someone bought it for me as a gift and I realized it's worth the splurge! My skin is so soft and it smells amazing. Even a few days after using it I can still smell it in my bathroom. I just bought my second bottle.,Positive
"These are fantastic. Ordered two but it was still a little shy on the type of coverage I wanted on my tree - I should have gone with the longer ones. They are very well done, but I was a little disappointed that the ends were just the string looped in a knot and not something a bit nicer (like a metal ring) but that is something I could do myself if I want. Packaging was very nice as well and they included a little felted sheep which my son liked.",Positive
Nice bag looks better with wear. A good value,Positive
Better than the same old first Christmas ornament,Positive
Very happy with this purchase. Very true to the picture and web description. Would order again!,Positive
I am actually not sure about this due to it being a gift.. the person that received it said they loved it so I am going with that.,Positive

Perfect way to remember Harambe,Positive
My granddaughter is blind and this is a perfect gift... Tactile and  in braille.,Positive
Exactly what I ordered. Cant wait til I get a frame for it!,Positive
"CANNOT SAY ENOUGH FANTASTIC THINGS!! I have purchased from this shop twice now and I am IN LOVE with her cutters and stamps. The cutters are beyond cute, functional, and her customer service is top notch!! The stamps leave such a smooth imprint and makes decorating much easier when flooding with icing or I guess if you wanted to you could just stamp fondant too. I will definitely order more. The only problem is she has SO many designs to choose from :)",Positive
"Beautiful print, fast shipping, arrived in a box as to prevent bending and it looks really good framed on the wall.",Positive

"Just as pictured, very pretty.",Positive
Happy with tham,Positive
"Beautiful trendy look!  I have the 16&#34; and it lays exactly where I want it.  I so hope it doesn't tarnish because this is a nice &#34;go to&#34; necklace.  It looks very pretty with a V-neck black top and just jeans!  It is a delicate necklace, as it should be for this look, but seems to be well made and the price point is great!",Positive
These decals are so easy to put up...great quality...put them up in my guest bathroom.  Great quality.,Positive
She likes it. When it said pashmina we were expecting it to be a true pashmina fabric. It wasn't but that's okay. Still nice.,Positive
This was a perfect wedding gift for one of my good friends. I wanted to place coordinates where the lower smaller print would go. The seller was great and prompt in response in regards to the coordinates. Great customer service. The sign arrived and it looked great! Craftsmanship was awesome! No complaints at all. Will probably buy again in the future. Great product and supports a local business!,Positive
"Can I just say that I'm ecstatic about this necklace? !! Ü.  Not only do I love the steampunk impression on the elephant itself, but the fine workmanship of the product is excellent.  I've been wearing it since it arrived, in a very well protected package, no less.  Five 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!  Ü",Positive
Perfect for your favorite recipes  and as a family heirloom.,Positive

Love the colors and resin,Positive
Beautiful! Just as pictured and the fabric is soft and flowy without feeling cheap or flimsy. Colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect! This is my first shawls from them and I will be ordering more in the future. So. Freaking. Happy.,Positive
What a unique gift! Shipped quickly.,Positive
Love this necklace. I wear it several times a week. Looks good with many styles.,Positive
This was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law for the chicken coop they built themselves.  They loved it and it was a gift I was proud to give.,Positive
[[VIDEOID:6224e89c101778a9bbb6a7581db20281]] UPDATE: after reaching out to the seller they sent me a replacement that I have been wearing for several days without incident. I love this ring and am so happy to have it. If you do have issues contact the seller they are very responsive and I could not be happier with their customer service!!<br /><br />The ring looks as is described and is beautiful to look at. Unfortunately that is all I can say about it. Cause wearing it for one day caused my finger to turn black where the ring was. There was also a sharp bit in the back that cut into my finger. The video shows what it looked like after I took it off. The ring claims to be sterling silver but I doubt that after wearing it. I have many rings I wear 24/7 that are real sterling silver and have never given me an issue. I have reached out to seller with my expirence and will add update if they respnd.,Positive
"I love this tray! The colors are rich and warm. The design with it's grapes and pomegranates reflect my childhood memories of harvesting grapes with the whole family... which were made into wine, or eaten at the table along with pomegranates picked off of our grandparents tree.  I especially love that this tray was hand painted in Italy where all my grandparents immigrated from. I'm going to buy a second one!!!",Positive
"These are well made and beautiful in person. Came in a small box with padding so they were protected during shipping, but still included the cardboard card pictured in the listing. Great as a gift, my wife was very happy!",Positive
I ordered this one because it was dark and looked cute. It is our 5th tag - all previous started to look bad after couple months (we live by the ocean and boy likes water). Tag arrived fast. Looked super cute. It is smaller then all previous and surprisingly writing is more visible. It gets a little foggy after few dives in the ocean but can be restored to shine with simple wash. I will be ordering more.<br />If I was going to suggest improvement the attachment ring (we got two sizes) can be sourced from a little better material.,Positive
"Beautiful earrings and well made. I tend to prefer very dainty jewelry so these are my statement earrings - I think for most though, these would be understated. Goes with a lot. I’ve worn them with jeans and with summer dresses.",Positive
Smells amazing and feels silky smooth. Definitely going to buy other products in this line. However... I didn't actually see lilac or gooseberry listed as ingredients on the back? Am I missing something?,Positive
Nice style<br />Mine was damaged unfortunately,Positive
Very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend  product. The American flag is a thing of beauty. Thank you Cedar Sense!!!!!,Positive
Love these earrings so much! They really dress up any outfit and elongate your neck. The only downside is that they don't come with backers. One fell off today and I can't find it so I may end up reordering.,Positive
Nicely monogrammed,Positive

+Came a week earlier than the expected arrival date<br />+Looks just like the picture<br />+Nicely packaged<br />+Clearly ledgable and pretty<br />-expensive for just a silver band with an inscription but very well done.<br /><br />I would buy again.,Positive
"I love this ring.  Just be careful when sizing it around your finger, but I just ordered three more as gifts.  I wear mine every day on my middle finger.  It rocks!",Positive
Works great,Positive
This bow looked beautiful on a Christmas wreath that I made; it was unusual. Good quality.,Positive
This print was the perfect addition to my sons room. He is obsessed with shoes (like most teenage boys). I actually purchased two prints and they both arrived within 2-3 days. Thank you for the awesome product and for responding to my questions so quickly. I ordered floating frames to display the prints and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase!,Positive
Saving this for a gift at Christmas time. A friend that works at a library.,Positive

"After a recent hip surgery and arduous recovery, I wanted a piece of art that would represent the wonder of the human body, our ability to heal and our powerful resilience. This piece was IT. I was nervous about buying it online but, it came in less than one week and was packaged very well. &#34;She&#34; has a prominent place in our living room and brings a whole new level of sophistication to the room. And she makes me smile whenever I look at her, as I am reminded of how far I've come. My husband and I absolutely love her. Maybe for different reasons. I don't know. Haha! We are incredibly pleased with the purchase. Thank you, Holly Lentz!",Positive

Quality prints. Ordered for a friend who is a meteorologist for his office.,Positive
"I prefer to use a mouse instead of a finger pad on my laptop.  My couch has a wider arm and this mouse pad fist perfectly, and it does not slide around.  The size of the pad is also just right.  It is not too big for the couch, nor is it too small for my mouse.<br /><br />The delivery also included a personal note from Patricia, who makes these by hand.  The materials are sturdy and will obviously last; and the stitching is perfect.",Positive

Cute. Purple picture frame goes great. Didn't come with frame,Positive
"Got these earrings for my wife since she liked the color, which is looks like purple iridescence.<br /><br />They are light and comfortable to wear, and she started wearing them the day they arrived.  She did not experience any itching while wearing the earrings.<br /><br />One concern though is that the black paint on the earring posts is already chipping away after just wearing it for the first time, and you can see a bit of the silver metal underneath.  It seems that when the earring backing or stopper is placed on the earring post to hold the earring in place, it rubs or chips on the black paint of the posts.<br /><br />Overall, she still likes the earrings.",Positive
"I just love this piece. It reminds me of our Powder, whom we lost in June to a brain tumor :(  Anyway, when I look at it, it makes be smile and feel warm inside!  I can see her happy face every time I walk by the painting. Looks exactly as the pic on Amazon. Great Great Artist!!",Positive

"What a great gift! I ordered the 2016 penny and copper disc with my granddaughter's name for an add-on gift for her graduation. It was packaged beautifully and I was delighted when I opened it. The key ring is adorable and the pictures on the site are exact replicas. I will be ordering these in the future for other &#34;year&#34; occasions. The price was very reasonable and most importantly, the customer service was exceptional. I had a question and the seller responded immediately and took care of my concern. Thank you so much! I love hand made items and finding this on amazon (which I trust!) made my day. I will most definitely buy from Silverado Jewelry again.",Positive
So far I love this product. It has a great smell and is a nice thick balm so I can use it to remove waterproof mascara without it running into my eyes and irritating them like other cleansing oils I have used. I use this as the first step in my triple cleanse and it remove makeup amazingly even the most stubborn waterproof stuff. I haven’t noticed any clogged pores since they use non comedogenic oils.,Positive
Me encanto para las foto de mi boda,Positive
Loved the prints!  High quality and received quickly... couldn't ask for more!,Positive
Great novelty to go along with the round tuit medallions.,Positive
"I love the product, but I am not crazy about the packaging.  It is beautifully packaged, but I use it in the shower and the pump seems awkward -- would love to get this in a squeezable bottle with perhaps a disc lid for easy use.  I use it with a nylon back brush, and it is a pain to hold the brush and the bottle and pump.  Seems like the price for this is too high, and an option for perhaps a refill size bottle without the fancy stuff would be great.",Positive
If you’re looking for a unique business card holder this is it! I receive so many compliments. The air plant is real!! Buy it! You won’t be disappointed.,Positive
I love them. Mine came out perfectly centered. Very easy to read. I can't wait to use them!. Waiting for new collars to come in for them.,Positive

Not only is the measuring tape exactly as described. But the customer service was amazing. We recieved our order within a few days and unfortunately the name was misspelled. The seller was extremely quick at responding to my messages about the issue and a replacement was sent out the next day. This is going to be a perfect father's day present.,Positive
I ordered a male/female and a conjoined twin. They’re amazing. I love the care they take packaging these items. I’ll probably be getting a few twins for gifts.,Positive

Nice piece if you're going to leave it displayed in your bathroom -- but regardless the grip is great (no slipping out of your hands while lathering).,Positive
Very happy with these. Great quality!,Positive

"I collect hamsa hands but refer to them as the Fatima hand. Out of all of the ones I own this one clearly stands above the rest<br />except for the one I received as a gift. If you are at all interested purchase this, it is even prettier in person. Warning.....after you see this any other Fatima hand will not measure up.",Positive

"I always have trouble with bracelets that fall off my tiny wrists.  This one is perfect.  Had to look at the website to figure out how to make it fit right, but it's very simple.  So easy to open - to roll on then just cinch it back up when it's on.  I love the look of the beads. It is very well made and feels super sturdy.  I am pleased.  I would not hesitate to recommend.",Positive
These are so cute and perfect for Halloween. Can't wait to wear them.,Positive
I framed this myself and gave it as a wedding gift. They loved it.,Positive

"It's difficult to find a quality almond pendant at all. I was quite pleased to finally come across this one. It is even better than I'd hoped.<br /><br />The sellers followed through on the offer in the description for a custom chain length upon request. It has been a hassle to request with different sellers so I was grateful for this aspect to be made so stress-free.<br /><br />The shipping wasn't two days or even a week but it still arrived more than two weeks ahead of schedule.<br /><br />The detail is very fine and the pendant has pleasing weight to it. I was impressed with the clean careful packaging aesthetics as well.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about buying from this seller, all I can say is that I can't think of a single negative involved in this purchase. I would absolutely buy from them again.",Positive
I used these to hang photos at a party. Worked great. It has 9 settings for the lights - a lot more than other light strings. I used tiny command hooks and they worked great in a rented building. Came right off the wall without a trace.,Positive
Cutest name tag for my fur baby! Great quality+ super cute design.,Positive
"As a Reiki Healer, I recently updated my room and found this wonderful artist!  I've bought 2 so far and will definitely be buying more.

"Love these, they are adorable I can’t wait to hang them in my nursery.",Positive
"I like this set of bracelets. The colors coordinate very well with each other. They are adjustable and very comfortable to wear. I like the silver circle charms that hang off of two of the bracelets. The only complaint I would have is that the description says 4 bracelets but there are only three included. Even the pictures show three bracelets, so I wasn't expecting more than that. Very cute set of bracelets, glad I got them.",Positive
"Love these cards.  I appreciated the clever images when I saw them on Amazon.  When the actual cards arrived they exceeded my expectations.  There was a handwritten 'thanks' on the outer box, and the cards are nice stock, well made, and well packaged. The colors are also rich and pleasing. Very happy I found these. I'll shop from Ritzy Rose again!",Positive

Nothing,Positive
Beautiful glitter/holographic nail polish.<br />Wears well on natural nails.<br />Doe dry out and become thick quickly.<br />Definitely add a polish thinner to your order when buying.,Positive
Perfect. Funny. I can drive a mini van as long as people know I dont take it seriously.,Positive
"Edited: I initially I had written a positive comment. The piece is nice. But the necklace turns rusty in just a matter of days. Even if you don’t wear it everyday. The little charm has remained in good shape. If you buy it, just know that the necklace is of poor quality.",Positive
I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Very attractive piece and high quality construction. My only suggestion would be to apply varnish to the wood to protect it from drips and spills. It is stained but not varnished.,Positive
"I loved the design of this, but they stretch if you arent careful, distorting it a little bit. It worked, but i see the flaws. Drivers side turned out good, passengers side ehhhh it will do only because I dont want to spend the $ for another set. Best advice, install on a hot summer day or use a hair dryer. If possible, use 2 people. One to hold the hair dryer, the other to keep the decal in place and not lift. The trees were the worst. On both sides they folded. Gotta be careful of those little things. I did receive them about a week sooner than expected. So that was great! Extra star just for the fast shipping.",Positive
❤️❤️❤️placed in girls locker room,Positive

Very happy with it.,Positive
This was a graduation gift for my daughter and it FAR EXCEEDED my expectations.  It was lovely and my daughter loved it!  I would highly recommend this seller for future purchases.,Positive
I love this bracelet! My wrists are too large to comfortably wear the strap that came with my Leaf. I also was not a huge fan of the tan strap. Ordered this strap (and another one from the same seller) and I could not be happier! You provide your wrist measurement so you know it is going to fit. The bracelet is well made and comfortable to wear.,Positive

These earrings are beautiful and unique--they are prettier than the picture.,Positive

Beautiful. My son really likes them,Positive
"This is an outstanding deal and a really great wallet no matter the price.  Made in the US from all US materials and the quality shows.  Most other places would charge at least twice this price.  I have been using a Craft and Lore wallet which is equal to this quality but much more expensive.  Again, at any price this is a nice wallet but at this price it’s a steal!  If you’re looking for a thin, minimalist leather wallet get one of these while you can!",Positive
I purchased this for my daughter.  She loves the scent and it is very easy to use.  She said it helps reduce stress and helps her sleep.  I have purchased other items similar to this and will purchase again.,Positive

I purchased this stencil because I am trying to do my dinning table like “Casa bonita” and as soon as I started using the stencil it never moved it stays in place no tape needed and it came well packaged and on a cardboard with a paper pin holding it and I got a bonus stencil butterfly in my package and I thought it was so awesome! I would definitely purchase more by the same seller,Positive

My kids enjoyed these. They love pac man.,Positive
"I used an app called “Rock Identifier” and I scanned the “yellow sapphire” I received and it claimed it was Citrine actually. Now I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the app and I’m no professional, but either way, the stone looks exactly like the picture and it is absolutely beautiful and I honestly don’t care whether it’s citrine or yellow sapphire, I still wear it.",Positive

The zipper is nice because I didn't even realize it had a zipper. There is one small pocket on both sides.  I will be ordering these again for Christmas!",Positive

I am very happy with this purchase.,Positive
I laughed so much when I seen this and had to order it. I laughed some more when it arrived. If you are a fan of Tyrone Biggums just buy it. You won't be sorry. I still get a kick out of this whenever I see it in my son's room. Too funny.,Positive

This is an absolute must for any proud dog mom or dad who wants their babies names (I had 2 on mine) on a chain. I LOVE THIS NECKLACE. My dogs are my life and this necklace allows me to showcase my love for them both. This chain is an ABSOLUTE MUST!!!  ❤️❤️,Positive
"Gorgeous chain! I bought this to go with my vintage, cat-eye reading glasses and it's a perfect combination!",Positive
I loved that the saying on the ornament said exactly what I felt about my sister...my best friend!!,Positive
"I used these on one wall of my child's nursery and they look great! I was concerned when I received the package because it seemed like there was no way so few sheets of decals could cover the area I wanted. After I cut them apart and started blocking them out along the wall, though, it became apparent that there were more than enough to cover the whole area.  They are very easy to apply and I have moved a few  after initial application without any trouble.",Positive
Great soap! Smoother skin you would see a difference. Thank you!,Positive
"This is a beautiful necklace and pendant. I wear it all of the time. I sleep with it and work out in it every single day through multiple workouts a day. Because of that, it tarnishes easily and often but I bought a silver polishing rag and it works PERFECTLY to keep my necklace and pendent looking brand new. My fiancé loves it as well. I feel honored to be able to wear something that represents my love and support for our loved ones in law enforcement.",Positive
Love this necklace. Purchased it as a Christmas gift for my daughter and I am sure she will love it too!,Positive
"Great Decal, decently priced:<br />- Easy to Apply (comes with directions how to apply the decal so that helps a lot)<br />- Fast Shipping (Company from Alaska, so you can kind of guess how long shipping will take)<br />- Great quality and looks good<br />Don't understand paying those few cents for shipping when shipping is untrackable via Amazon. Carrier is USPS withing the USA, just Standard First Class Stamp mail, which I am assuming is where the few cents shipping fee goes to. Overall great product would buy again.",Positive
These are adorable!!!,Positive
This is such a beautiful and meaningful gift; I bought this for my sister and she loved it. Really pleased with the quality of both the necklace and service; namely their acquiescence/extra attention to my request for a custom definition card with the box. Overall a good experience.,Positive
This was a gift.,Positive
Beautiful collars! Extremely pleased with my purchase. Leather is not waterproof so these will be for summer use only.,Positive
"These prints are beautiful. They come in a nice, sturdy, attractive cardboard-type envelope that keeps them safe during shipping and would make them wonderful as a gift. The paper is high quality. I looked at similar, cheaper versions of these prints, but I’m so glad I chose these. They are more than I expected. I absolutely recommended these.",Positive
Very nice notepad. My sister loved it as a gift. Great gift for a dog lover. Pages were thick and high quality paper.,Positive
These prints look great in my son's space themed bedroom. They are exactly what I expected. I have no complaints. I got some inexpensive 8x10 matted frames to put them and they look great.,Positive
Love this item...any chance you can make a 2 socket outlet cover that comes in the same size?,Positive
For me is perfect !<br />My daughter love it .<br /><br />Thanks,Positive
Very tiny but very pretty too. Engraving is not as clear as in the pictures.,Positive
This is my second  holster from Neptune Concealment and they've hit it out of the park again. Very happy with the holster. It arrived fast for a custom handmade holster.,Positive

I will start by saying I was very disappointed in the mailing system my package was damaged and of course it wasn’t from the company who sent out this beautiful ring it was indeed the mailing system I was happy when I opened the package the box the ring was in was completely destroyed but the ring was in a tiny bag that it was unharmed I’m so thankful for that because this ring is beautiful the detail in this ring is amazing it is definitely a tall ring it does sit high but I love it the blue shines so beautifully and the white gem shines just as bright my finger has not turned green so that’s a plus because my skin is Sensitive the pins in the ring are sturdy so I don’t feel like my ring is going to break and it is true to size but I’m not sure what else to say only that I will be buying more from this company because the craftsmanship is amazing and I recommend this ring to anyone who loves a little bling in their life and likes tall rings if you love something different than this is the ring for you and I will say one day of wearing this ring I got so many compliments on it I love this ring :),Positive
"These earrings are obviously hand made, absolutely adorable, great packaging, & I love that they came w/extra backs in case you lose 1 :)",Positive
sweet,Positive
Well made and decorated product. I bought three colors at once and all delivered neatly in one package with good packing not to ruin the fragile wood flakes.,Positive
Great smell will order again!,Positive
"funny, just how I feel some morning",Positive
well made and was pleased at their appearance when worn.,Positive
Perfect size. Love it.,Positive
"The box it came it was beautiful, maybe you paid for the box but I’m ok with it , the necklace I was hoping would be on some kind of leather it’s just like a string , but it wears well comfortable and easy to adjust to your own neck ! I have no complaints love it !",Positive
"Awesome sign. Pretty, and it works! 😃",Positive
"These seem solidly made and assume will have a decent lifespan if not caught on something and subjected to a lot of stress. I was not a fan of how the two rows of beads are so tightly bound to one another than it almost seemed as though they had been glued together. Purely personal preference, but I’d rather have two single strand bead bracelets that a double-strand that acts as though it is one fused strand. I bought the brown and was not a fan of the color, but that is also purely personal preference.<br /><br />I’ll not speak to any supposed mystical powers of the beads as I assume there are none.",Positive
It works as described and it’s not greasy,Positive
Nice and simple design. I get lots of compliments.,Positive
Service,Positive
"Was on time and packaged well. Easily applied and it came with instructions on how to apply. I applied them to my rear window. My cars a little muddy from the rain, sorry.😅",Positive
"They are a little smaller than I envisioned, but they're great!",Positive
"It's was great, good job. Thanks",Positive

"Mahalo Yinahawaii!  SO Love The Hibiscus, Teal Sea Glass, Pearl Necklace  ;-)  Arigato Yinahawaii !-)",Positive
"I was a bit hesitant as I didn't want the typical address. I wanted a stamp for a special project. I filled in what I wanted it to say, and it's just what I wanted. I thought the letters might be too crowded. They weren't. It is going to be useful and clever for what I want to use it for.",Positive
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen. I am new to sewing and honestly didn't know about Enamel Needle Minder but this thing is amazing. I can have 5 needles threaded ready to go attached and ready for when I need them. Plus  I am no longer sticking needles into my couch arm (I know horrible) or dropping needles on the floor. I can't wait to get more.,Positive
"This outfit is perfect in every way! It’s exactly what I ordered, it shipped very quickly, and is in tip top shape! The onsie is quality, and it’s going to be the perfect coming home outfit for my new baby girl!  Love it!!",Positive
"Great shipping time, figurine size and overall quality.",Positive
"Ordered this for a special birthday and so happy I did! I accidentally gave the wrong address and it was returned back to the store owners. They couldn't have been nicer and more understanding! Reshipped it at no charge back to me----- truly a wonderful company to deal with and great customer service. The vinyl clock record is just what I imagined it to be----- personalized and great quality. I will be ordering more for gifts, as my husband wants one now! Thank you again!",Positive
The paper is a really nice weight and displays really well. The cars still have a lot of detail despite being small to be able to fit all of them. Really cool to be able to look at how they change each year.,Positive
Works great & fits all my different tumblers,Positive
I bought these as gifts for my kids and I love the look and feel of these boxes,Positive
I absolutely adore this bracelet!,Positive
"It was very nice, just what I wanted.",Positive

Loved them.,Positive
It was the perfect gift for the perfect person,Positive
Absolutely stunning. Shipped in less than 24 hours.,Positive
"Beautiful.  It is smaller than what it appears to be in the picture.  Still, I love it",Positive
This is a gift that has not been given yet so I do not know if it is what she wants.  A smaller one was on her wish list.  I looks great to me but the receiver of this will be the real test.,Positive
"Haven't framed it yet, but it will be nice. 🥰",Positive
"""Happy Campers  was our preschool theme for end of the year party. We had different styles  and font which was really cool.",Positive
Liked the look. Lettering blended in with overall color and didn't really standout. Smaller than expected and picture.,Positive
They are light and beautiful fashionable for the holidays.,Positive
"Such a cute sticker, explains the life of a college student in two easy words. Recommend!",Positive
"Love it! Exactly what I was looking for! Lightweight, wire , perfect for a cartilage piercing too!",Positive
I received my necklace and didn’t realize it would be as small as it was. It has pretty wire work on it and the chain is very nice. My big disappointment is that it tarnishes within a few day and has to be constantly polished.<br />It has a very tiny tinkle sound when it is shaken.<br />I’ve gotten many compliments on it.,Positive
Great with my other pin for my hat,Positive
cute sign!,Positive
Great quality and they look fantastic,Positive
The Barcelona fan in my house LOVED them!,Positive

"I have been a phlebotomist for 10 years and deal with different types of people all day. A lot of negative, dark, angry people lately and I was looking for something to protect me and my energy. After 1 week I can honestly say it works and I see a huge improvement in my weeks and energy. The type of people I interact with has been mainly positive and rarely negative. Any negative interaction is handled in a positive way without my mental or emotions being effected. It is great quality, stretchy yet strong. I have already gotten 3 compliments on it. The necklace sent as a extra gift was a huge surprise and is just as great as the bracelet. I read that each bead is filled with Love  by the bracelet crafter and I think that’s huge in the quality and performance of this product.",Positive
"It is very dainty, but well made, not flimsy. Great purchase",Positive
Loved this as a customized gift for the grandparents that have everything.  Arrived quickly and looked great!,Positive

The best scent - and it last forever!!! My favorite lotion- great for winter months & as a foot moisturizer.,Positive
great,Positive
Just what our Cottage needed 👍,Positive
Love it,Positive
"[[VIDEOID:63db81f86fbc4a9008d14439014e2aa7]] Was skeptical at buying it at first since it only had a 1 star rating, but I bought it and I don't regret it. Totally would recommend. Keep in mind that it does not have the letters raised as shown in the video but colors are bright and it is exactly the same as the photo.",Positive
Awesome picture for any disconcerting Rush fan.,Positive
The blanket looks great. Nice material. It turned out really nice. It’s just a litter smaller then I thought but she loves it. It can cover her. I’m considering order another in the bigger size 🥰,Positive
I bought this as a gift for myself. It is so stunning and well made. Plan to buy more from this talented artist &lt;3,Positive
"Alice wrote me a personal note with the delivery:  “How did you feel when you first opened the package;”  First, anticipation, followed by being impressed with the packaging, the wonderful leather smell, the monogram embossing to personalize and the structure and durability.  This is exactly what I was looking for!",Positive
Adds curb appeal to my home. Perfect size and easy to see.,Positive
Well made and exactly as described. Shopping took a little bit longer but the wait is worth it for this hand made ring.,Positive
First off the ribbons came sooner that expected delivery date. I picked the royal blue color and white print on ribbons for my baby shower. I needed these ribbons for the baby shower favors. The ribbons came out beautiful 😍. I will order again in the future if I need personalized ribbons again.,Positive
"I like how its made and the style. It seems to be working as well, no unwanted visitors since I purchased this.",Positive

"I bought a pair for my mom and myself to have some more fun during hockey season. I loved that these were VGK colors!! They are sooo cute and we get compliments every time we wear them. SUPER easy to put in! My mom has very fine hair and I have thicker hair, but Kritter Klips have no problem staying put on either of us!",Positive
Looks like they're printed on high quality photo paper. Looks great. I personally don't like that they kindve have that sheen that's on photographs but not a big deal.,Positive
"I bought this for my girlfriend of eight months, and sunflowers are her favorite - she cried when I gave it to her! The pendant is clearly made with quality and care and looks absolutely stunning when your significant other wears it.",Positive
"I was fooled by the pics on this one. I knew they'd be smaller than shown in the man's hand, but these are tiny. Smaller than a golf pencil. They are very pretty, arrived in good condition, and arrived quickly.",Positive
My daughter LOVES this shirt! It was perfect for her birthday and she wears it often. It does start to fade after several washes.,Positive

So adorable and easy to use. My son is going to be so excited to have the wrappers say Wonka!,Positive
"My holder was packed firmly so it arrived in one piece and looks amazing.  I find it rather soothing to watch the smoke rise out of the top.  What I really loved was the short handwritten note as well the sample sticks to try along with a list of other scents they offer with cute descriptions.  It's clear that they make these with care and appreciate their customers.  I'm burning a ""Pacific Surf"" stick and think I just fell in love with this scent!",Positive
Absolutely love this! Had been searching for a unique and heartfelt gift for weeks! This is the Perfect one year anniversary gift for my husband. Cant wait to give it to him!,Positive
"What a yummy smell! I ordered it because I miss that sweet olive smell that floated all over New Orleans when we lived there. This isn’t quite it, but close enough to bring back great memories. I hate to use it and wear off the beautiful design, so I just have to order more. They delivered really quickly, too!",Positive
"Okay, can we just talk about how pictures don't do these earrings justice? They are literally so beautiful and don't make my ears itch at all. LOVE LOVE LOVE",Positive
This is the cutest little wing ever. Love it,Positive

"I waited two weeks before writing this review to track the progress of my skin using 16J products, and I am thrilled to say that everything exceeds my expectations! I suffer from a skin condition that has resulted in scarring, and I am extremely careful what I apply to my sensitive skin. My scarring, texture and softness has improved significantly since using 16J. Every other day I’ve used the scrub, which is just the right texture – neither too harsh nor soft, just right – and coupled with the soothing oil in it, leaves my skin feeling gently buffed and renewed. I even use it on my face one a week. The Green Quench is my favorite – my skin is so supple after using it, I often find myself rubbing my arms throughout the day because I can’t believe how soft they remain hours after stepping out of the shower. At night I apply Mo’ Butter to scars on my legs, and have noticed enough improvement where I’ve worn shorts for the first time this year. It is quite rich so I apply it sparingly to my face after the shower and at night, and my skin retains noticeably more moisture than with any other cream I’ve used. The Lip Rico with a hint of cocoa is not only great in helping my chapped lips, but is also delicious! With all the different oils in these products I was initially concerned before my purchase about the fragrance, but it is a very subtle and appealing scent that doesn’t compete with my light fragrance. With 60% of what we apply to our skin absorbed, my skin is loving this new diet, and feels simultaneously healthy, scrubbed and soft. I’m a convert!",Positive
Perfect,Positive
Love these.. my second pair from this seller. Lightweight and cute. Get many compliments. The clear backs that come with the earrings don’t keep them in place well but I just take some from other earrings that are tighter and it keeps them from moving around in my ear,Positive
"Stones were arranged just as I had requested, delivered much sooner than expected.  I ordered this ring to commemorate driving thru a rainbow and seeing the rainbow hit the hood of my car, then as I drove thru it, I could see the air around me sparkling with little prisms floating in the air.  Incredible experience, how many lifetimes would it take for that to happen again?  My ring is a perfect reminder of that day. :-)",Positive
I was really thrilled with this purchase!! My daughter looked so beautiful in it. The fit was true to size and has a little stretch to allow my little one to wear it well into the year. I recommend this product to all looking for a unique and well designed personal birthday look for their princess!!!,Positive
Love them,Positive
It came in later than it was supposed to which made me upset because I was so ready to receive it but other than the delay in delivering it’s awesome. It’s super cute and fit my iPhone 10 Xs max perfect!,Positive

You can also order additional pieces. I’ve gotten many compliments and friends have also ordered them after seeing mine. I highly recommend!,Positive
"At first I got the photos and thought, ""this would look stupid just hanging them up without a frame"", it didn't occur to me to get the frames also. I would suggest getting the corresponding 8x10 frames with this order. these photos are super cute and adorable. makes the baby room look cozy and warm. my daughter noticed all the photos when she went in her room, she pointed at all of them.",Positive
I didn't get any frames with my posters. I love the posters though.,Positive

Gave it to My Babygirl for Christmas she absolutely loves it,Positive
My boyfriend is turning 26 and we love Naurto so I wanted to throw him a birthday theme as that. After weeks of looking online they really have nothing but I found this and omg! It’s amazing!

Very cute!!,Positive
This is a terrific cozy.  It fits my various medium sized tea pots very well.  The only tricky part is getting the teapot popped into it but a bit of practice makes it easy.  This keeps the teapot hot and brings a smile to my face each time I use it.  I am wanting more of these in different patterns.,Positive
I wish it was made for a small wrist. It rolls around and not a lot of links to adjust,Positive

Jamal is great seller to work with. After my order he immediately contacted me to confirm details. We were in Marrakesh 4 years ago and got simulator sleepers on bazar.

I saw this wallet & knew it was the one for him.<br />  Needless to say, when he got it he was thrilled! He’s had it for about 4 months now & has had no issues with it or it’s design. Therefore, I would highly recommend this wallet to anyone, male or female, who’s looking for something simple but made really well.",Positive

"Love this,  looks perfect in a floating frame!",Positive
"Love this wallet, its made of genuine calf's leather which has that solid feel and smell to it. It is aIso hand made and hand stitched. Another reason to like this wallet is that it hold 4 cards, 2 on the ouside and 2 on the inside. I imagine I can add an extra card or two if I double up. A nice stainless steel clip on the inside hold my cash securely. It comes packed in a Toros Craft drawstring sack!<br /><br />Excellent wallet with a great price.",Positive
Product is good.,Positive
Great construction and stability.  My daughter uses this for gymnastics practice and she loves it.  Easy to store if your are not using it and it goes together quickly.,Positive
Beautiful !,Positive
"Almost 2 months later, and it still smells like a farm (not a typical leather smell). Otherwise, it's well made. The leather is not of the finest quality, yet definitely durable. It is also perfect for laser engraving. We did air it out for over 2 weeks (as suggested). Even outside in fresh air. Also cleaned it with a leather cleaner. The smell is off-putting for me, personally. Still attempting to air it out as I would love to use it. The pockets are the best part, in my opinion. I have attempted to take photos illustrating the pockets. Worth the price? Yes. Would I order again? I'm on the fence, due to the odor.",Positive
"Great communication, and amazing work! The print is absolutely beautiful and shows how the sky looked the day I had my daughter. Amazing!",Positive
Bought them as a gift for a daisy lover. Very sweet.,Positive

"What a wonderful Easter Sign ""He Has Risen.""  I'm absolutely amazed at the exceptionally great service on letter spacing and prompt delivery.  Now it hangs in an antique frame at my front door declaring that ""He Has Risen""  a much needed message during this Covid19 pandemic even though there will be no gatherings to worship.  Thank you very much!",Positive

"I picked this out for my son who is a young man soon to be married and out on his own. It's a sweet little reminder to show I care and a cool conversation piece with the Morse code spelling out ""I love you"".<br />  It is slight in appearance and almost as small as a rubber band on the wrist but doesn't feel fragile. A nice option when the person you're buying for doesn't like bigger or clunky bracelets.",Positive
GO GIANTS!,Positive
My daughter loved it. It’s a constant reminder and I love hopes and dreams for her!,Positive
"My partner, and I love to get matching jewelry or things that come in pairs, so that when we are separated for the day, when one of us goes to work or out with a friend, we can have a piece of each other to look at and remember, and love during the day. we got this set mostly for the bracelets but we thought the necklaces would work too. After opening and trying everything on, we decided that the necklaces looked a little cheap, but we absolutely love the bracelets. The necklaces are on a cheap black cord, and the stones that are used in the necklace are only in the front part and you can see the rest of the resin that they used to produce the  Piece is just clear and empty. They could have put more stones in or used a Sidder amount of resin, and it would’ve looked better. The bracelets on the other hand, are super adjustable, which helps, because I have very thick wrists, and in the middle of the bracelet, there is a magnet that connects to the other bracelet like I showed her the picture, and it is so cute!  I love that when I get close to my partner, it connects to his bracelet and it reminds us of our connection and love for each other!",Positive
