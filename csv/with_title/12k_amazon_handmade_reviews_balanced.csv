"Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!",Negative
Loved it Beautiful and well made.,Negative
Not what I expected at all Not what I expected at all,Negative
very sad bracket arrived Broken.  ,Negative
Even smaller in real life Do not waste your hard earned money it's as thick as a quarter at the base and light as a feather.,Negative
Map is severely cropped ! Product is NOT as described...  Save your money on this one!!  Map is severely cropped...,Negative
Cheap It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.,Negative
"Disney shirt Soft, true to size",Negative
"Picture does not match the earrings The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.",Negative
Poor quality I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.,Negative
"Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.",Negative
"Already Dying After 3 Weeks I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.",Negative
"The items I ordered were misleading The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..",Negative
"Just buy the key It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.",Negative
"Very cheaply made but not for a cheap price I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again",Negative
Allergies Have allergy. There is too much bronzer. And smell disgusting (,Negative
It’s nice but small It’s pretty but it’s small,Negative
Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.,Negative
"This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is ... This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is seriously crooked.  It's very apparent and for that I'm disappointed.  Had it been flush or closer to, I'd love it.",Negative
Underestimated gift This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.,Negative
Two Stars As described but packaging could have been better for the price,Negative
"Decent smelling, long time to ship though Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)",Negative
Damaged Great looking item. It came in bent- not too happy.,Negative
"Don't waste your $$ or time This is a complete rip off!!!  Don't waste your $$ or time!  It turned within a few days of wearing it!!!!!!!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE, DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!!!!!!!!",Negative
Not impressed This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be,Negative
Wasn’t good for nose ring. Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.,Negative
"Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.",Negative
"Beautiful but broke an hour after wearing! The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.",Negative
"Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.",Negative
It smells nice [[VIDEOID:8b03a70c569f973cb64c965e426c8895]] Whipped?  Not so much. I got a half jar of brown scented oil. But it does have a nice scent.,Negative
☹️ Not happy it was a bad purchase,Negative
Wouldn’t buy again. Slightly blurry and it’s just a sticker over the blade couldn’t use the blade for anything. I know it’s to be collected but I still expect a knife to have a usable blade.,Negative
"Not quite right I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.",Negative
Don’t waste your time I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.,Negative
Smaller than we wanted Ok but smaller than we thought.  Always read the measurements!,Negative
Too small Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.,Negative
Very small It was just a small ceramic ornament cute but certainly not worth $25,Negative
Not happy... Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.,Negative
Too Pink Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.,Negative
Chunky It's kind of chunky and it bumped it falls apart but for the most part it stays together and does his job but it just looks a little ghetto and really big,Negative
One Star Very bad made broke same day my daughter got it,Negative
"Looked so cute for 5 minutes They came in so cute and after the first day, with careful hand-washing, all of the decals started peeling off of both of them. So disappointing.",Negative
One Star It was not what I expected,Negative
Disappointing I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.,Negative
"Not worth it. I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed ""sterling silver "" which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!",Negative
Save your money! No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.,Negative
The clasp broke after one wearing. Poorly made. The clasp broke after one wearing.,Negative
"Incorrect description of product I was very disappointed to find that that this 2-pack of frames, which were both to hold 4 X 6 photos, turned out to be one for a 4 X 6 photo, and one for a 5 X 7 photo. They will not be the matched pair I had planned on.",Negative
poor quality The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again,Negative
Poor quality Poor quality fabric messy writing<br />Looks like a felt pin was used<br />Plus totally gross a black hair was inside when I unfolded it,Negative
"Great Idea, Terrible execution. So sad. What I got was really awful. It was not hand printed, it was computer generated, and in addition several words were misspelled. These folks took a great concept; got in a hurry and totally ruined it. So sad because it was a great idea. They probably should have charged more and done it right.",Negative
"Flag Many of the stars where misfired they did not even look close to stars, the instruction video show a piece to install the stickers and it did not come with one.",Negative
The hanger is beautiful but the wording is not sturdy at all! The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.,Negative
Make the poster bigger Dislike to smallpox,Negative
Does not smell .... I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.,Negative
"Just a photo not a poster It is just a photo printed. Same thing you could do at Walmart for a few cents. The print is a nice print, but not close to being worth 13 dollars. Maybe $1.",Negative
"Very small Will not fit average adult wrist, very small",Negative
Just a piece of paper I thought this would be something other than just a peice of photo paper - wrong! Just type this up yourself and go to Walmart to print it. It will be the same thing and cheaper.,Negative
Not what I expected Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.,Negative
Doesn't stick to anything  ! You just as well kiss a five dollar and see if it sticks to anything. All you're doing is wasting five dollars.,Negative
It broke. Broke 2 days after outting it on.,Negative
"Trying to return Have requested return over a week ago, no response from seller.  Item not quite up to par.",Negative
I made a buying mistake. Didn't read the description clearly. I thought I was buying the dish.  Turns out I could use the item so no return.,Negative
Tarnish Tarnished within a week!,Negative
One Star terrible quality & one of the birds upside down even.,Negative
picture of a picture..like our you serious? picture of a picture..like our you serious? i could have screen shot the pic on my phone and printed it out myself ..get it together..false ad..you should be embarassed!,Negative
Not good quality They bend to easily and mess up design.,Negative
Not happy! This is not at all what I believed it to be.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning,Negative
Not what Is pictured This is not what the picture is. I’m upset it’s a rooster. And it’s not easy to stamp the egg. I would have been fine with it not stamping correctly it’s for my daughter but I didn’t want to stamp out eggs with a rooster when in the pictures it’s a hen.,Negative
"Paper thin & flimsy Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.",Negative
Trash It was just a few prints. Nothing special. I guess you get what you pay for.,Negative
It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint,Negative
Not worth the money. Will tarnish. Not worth the money.,Negative
"Lavendar Sage melt - disappointed ""not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.",Negative
"Cheap. Made in China. Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.",Negative
Extremely Disappointed Unfortunately I am not very satisfied with my necklace that my husband got me for Mother’s Day as cute as it is it’s very delicate and it broke and I’ve only had it for like five weeks so I would highly recommend NOT buying this necklace!,Negative
Ring I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.,Negative
"Not worth the price Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.",Negative
"Smells like caramel, not pappy's pipe. Smells nothing like a pipe or even what's in the description.  They smell like Werther's caramel.  Very disappointed.",Negative
"looks nice Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.",Negative
Not Kawaii- knock off; tiny container Not Kawaii- knock off; tiny container.,Negative
to little to narrow more like for a small child it was so so thin narrow ring.,Negative
"CHEAP QUALITY! They were thin and danity, which is what i wanted.. but if you plan on taking them on and off every day, good luck! They are very thin, extremely hard to latch and they bend and distort very easily. I could make these at home with some wire for less then what i paid for these. Save your money!!",Negative
Not at all as advertised Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!,Negative
waste of my money and damage to my skin first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !,Negative
"Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.",Negative
"Just host rock, nothing shiny. Just cut<br />The crap<br />This is<br />All dirt",Negative
"Could have been better. They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.",Negative
"Not worth it Was great until I was exfoliating in the shower. Long story short, it broke after 2 weeks",Negative
Waste of money Letters are super small and light weight. A complete waste of $60! Does not look anything like the advertisement. Very dissatisfied and seller will not let me return!,Negative
Nope Dangling stone fell off first time wearing,Negative
"Cheap metal, disappointment Finish wore off in less than a month.<br /><br />Got what what I paid for......and apparently I paid for garbage.",Negative
"Loves nice things Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.",Negative
"Very delicate Very frail, broke easily. Should be sold for less.",Negative
"Fake This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.",Negative
Think before you order The quality of the chain is fine but the arrow itself looks like it was already used and seemed oxidized. You can even see it that they both are different colors. Maybe I’ve got a copy that was returned before. I don’t know but I was disappointed,Negative
Don't like it Leaves a sticky feel on my hair and has a weird smell that's unplesant.,Negative
"Eh.. It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.",Negative
Cheap Not worth buying,Negative
Cheap quality Cheap quality. The bracelet didn’t even last me two months.,Negative
"Do NOT purchase!!!!! I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them. I've worn backless shoes many times, & could easily keep them on. These do not stay on my feet! Sad thing is, they are non returnable!!! What a rip off! Guess I learned my lesson!",Negative
Fell apart After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!,Negative
"Boo This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.",Negative
Cute but could be designed better Lightweight earring but they keep twisting backwards and getting caught or twisted within the post,Negative
I hate the font. It says sweet dreading.  The return amount on this product was $70. It really is I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to… And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.,Negative
"it is too fragile, mine fell and broke before use It is too fragile easy to break",Negative
"No lo recomiendo 👎 Lo compre en octubre para regalo de Navidad de mi esposo y para sorpresa extremadamente pequeño y nada que ver para el precio, pobre calidad, el vendedor nada que te ayuda simplemente aun diciendole que esta nuevo en su cajita no acepta la devolucion por estar pasado de tiempo. Nada profesional al menos podia ayudar al cliente aunque hiciera un descuento. NO RECOMIENDO HACERLE COMPRAS A ESTE VENDEDOR. 👎👎👎",Negative
"No Frame In fairness, the small print does disclose that a frame is not included.  But the picture clearly displays a frame.  $16.00 for a sheet of rag paper.",Negative
Zero value for money Not worth it. It’s basically printed paper. I don’t know how tf I’m supposed to stick it up the wall. Should definitely come with a glue to peel off.,Negative
"Bad Smelling It has a bad smelling undertone that makes the whole house stink. It does initially smell like lemons, but after a few minutes smells really bad (waxy/rotten fruit/sour).",Negative
Sterling silver? Definitely not. That was the worst piece of jewelry I've ever bought. Costume jewelry lasted longer than this earring. Turned my ear green n black around the pierced area. The so-called m sterling metal started crumble peeling off with some time type of crushing around the ball.... Waste of money. Quality mi rassss,Negative
Cute but smells like mold Disappointed!! It is the perfect size and would be a great addition except it smells. Have tried a few things and still can't get it to not stink like mold!,Negative
"SO VERY SMALL if you are ordering this for a small child, this would be great.",Negative
"It’s the same shape but not red Pretty brownish, looks like dirt.",Negative
One Star Very small and bendable,Negative
I can only smell it if It’s right under my nose Can’t really smell anything,Negative
What you see is not what you get. What you see here is NOT what you get. It's more of a necklace pendant rather than a dog/cat tag. And i say necklace beacise they literally sent me a necklace. I only will not be returning this beacuse it does have my info on the tag so it will suffice so that my cat can roam. But really they advertise this product the worng way.,Negative
Now what I was expecting. Not what I was expecting. This was literally a copied 8x10 print.,Negative
Pretty but Received broken sent back,Negative
Great colors Nice print but when I saw ad on line it looked like a print stretched on a box frame but it was a flat 8 by 10 print.,Negative
Super cute but they broke almost immediately These earrings were super cute and I was very excited to wear them.  They fit perfectly and looked amazing.  The only problem is that after wearing them for not even 24 hours the bar broke off from the stem.  They are super cute earrings and I wish I could’ve gotten more time to wear them before their early demise.,Negative
Two Stars Pretty but too heavy for me,Negative
Poor quality The picture of the stackable rings is very misleading. The rope ring is great but the solid one is a very cheap thin piece of copper wire. Would never purchase from this vendor again.,Negative
"Horrible, literally 2 days after I purchased this bracelet ... Horrible , literally 2 days after I purchased this bracelet for my 3 months old baby , his wrist was green and the bracelet was brown. Horrible product , do not get it !",Negative
"Broke the second day I wore it! The chain is really cheap, so it broke the second day I wore it . I lost one of the jewels when it broke. Disappointed.",Negative
Too strong I couldn't stand Too strong  I couldn't stand it,Negative
FAKE!!!!! [[VIDEOID:e50a3a286858da45b9e51d30be27c542]] I didn’t know obsidian stone turns clear after exposure to multiple showers and dish washing what a versatile stone!!!  🙄🙄🙄,Negative
"Not what I was expecting at all. The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!",Negative
start unraveling as soon as cut. Have to cut each one and they unravel rapidly.,Negative
Broken Beads Unfortunately this bracelet broke. I was so disappointed. The packaging was beautiful and I thought I purchased a good solid product BUT to my disappointment the strings didn’t hold the beads. Poor quality,Negative
Drastically overpriced 18mm is 0.70 inches in length.  At $20+ you should be getting 2 handfuls of raw moonstone considering you can get a 2 inch moonstone for around $1.50 at your local Mast General Store.  Do your research folks.  Don't let someone on the internet aping off the current fad of faux spiritualists rip you off.,Negative
Looks like a picture printed from CVS I was very disappointed I'm this item. It was small and unframed. It was basically a small picture that looked like it had been printed out. Not as described,Negative
Cute but not what I thought Not what I thought,Negative
"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SHOP!!!! I ordered a size large in women’s for my daughter who likes things oversize. The shirt is tiny. Unfortunately they do not offer returns or exchanges so I’m stuck with a shirt that would probably fit a five-year-old. I do not recommend buying from the shop, especially due to their return policy.",Negative
Size is incorrect description Not big at all said not fit across the front of car like pictured it is a few inches long is all very small.,Negative
"Not very easy to use Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.",Negative
Not real it’s not a real crystal,Negative
"Poor quality We thought the product was made very cheaply, especially considering the price. The product also came damaged.",Negative
Disappointing Tarnished on me very quickly.  I thought it was stainless steel but doesn’t seem to be. Cute while it lasted though. Wore for about a month.,Negative
"It's on photo paper I have other decor that's actually printed on old dictionary paper, this is just a photo copy (for the same price I paid for real dictionary paper). Returned.",Negative
Mine came with a bend in the corner and the ... Mine came with a bend in the corner and the photo stock paper had an aged look to it. It's ok - not wowed by it.,Negative
Not good I just found another site where I will reorder the 2 I had made for my newlywed children The engraving was sloppy,Negative
Okay! Cup had a scratch on it! Sorta noticeable.,Negative
"Cheap looks nice, but broke after two weeks of use.<br />Metal is not strong and the stones cracked",Negative
Don’t buy it! This came as a piece of cheap paper. Don’t buy it!,Negative
"Disappointed The handwriting matches perfectly, HOWEVER.  I have only worn the bracket 2x and it is already changing colors. You can see it on the v and e.",Negative
One Star Does not look like it layvasbthenoucture shows,Negative
Cute but not sturdy These are very cute but not sturdy at all. Mine were broken when I received them.,Negative
Can’t return The T shirt is fine but I found something I like better and this is ineligible for returns. The description was very misleading and now I’m out $25.,Negative
"Damaged Came late, bent up and parts unglued",Negative
"Waste of money I followed all the instructions for putting this up. I was super excited to put this up in my toddlers room. When it was time to peel the rest of the paper off (the sticker had been up on the wall), it peeled all the letters off with it. I tried several different ways and it ended up ripping the lettering. Had to throw it in the trash.",Negative
For metal mailboxes only They would not stick at all to a plastic mailbox. Had to throw them away.,Negative
Poorly made!!! One of the white stone was missing when I received the ring. Poorly made. Seller never contacted. Won't suggest this product.,Negative
Not worth it I expected so much more.  I gave them with an apology.,Negative
Terrible quality fell apart before even putting up. Terrible quality fell apart before even putting up. Didn’t even come with enough screws to put together and thrown in a makeshift box! I should have flushed my $$ down the toilet. Screws it came with were too small to go through the product and into a wall and the ore made hole with the screws given went right threw the shelf breaking it before it could be assembled and used. I’d rate no stars if it let me.,Negative
Fake! Not genuine sterling silver or hypoallergenic.  The earrings are very flexible like plastic and irritate my earlobes.,Negative
Cheap but beautiful This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.,Negative
Looks like a pixelated print out. Nothing like a watercolor. Disappointed,Negative
Smaller than expected Much smaller than expected. Pretty though. You can make these yourself. Not difficult to do. But for the price they are nice.,Negative
"Breathable but not a good fit The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.",Negative
... expected - does not look hand crafted - very disappointed Not as expected - does not look hand crafted - very disappointed,Negative
"Not what I ordered They are not beaded.. they are plain earrings. They are nice, but not what I bought.",Negative
The patch was smaller  on web and it didn’t stick also over charge me from what was on site. Very smaller then what was showing does not stick like it should’ve over charge for what it was worth,Negative
I sent for a refund and have yet to receive an email with directions on how to do it. The poster was way to big. I clicked on the wrong size. Wanted to return it but have yet to receive a return shipping label. Everytime I try to click claim it says error. So now I’m stuck with a poster I don’t need.,Negative
"not what I expected I only received one of the two I ordered, shipping took a very long time, and the one I received seemed smaller and cheaper than it looked online.",Negative
Not worth it The words came off within 3 days,Negative
Poor Quality check There is a smear of something on the color wrap of both pilsner coolers. It’s noticeable so I don’t know why it was shipped. I spent close to $80 on 2 Pilsner coolers. I would have expected better quality. I should have returned them.,Negative

Not very well made. Clasp broke when putting it on. Mother’s Day gift that looked beautiful. But unfortunately quality was not poor. I returned the earrings much to my mother’s disappointment after the clasp broke off just as she was putting them on for the first time.,Negative
"Poor Quality ans high price This item is of poor quality and is so much smallest than depicted on the site. On top of that you have to pay to return the item. If I knew that i would have never purchased the item. Additionally, the item is not worth the price. Amazon should not allow venders like this on the site as they diminish your brand.",Negative

Cheap Not what expected.,Negative
Cheaply made just cheap product sold at big price Had I seen this at a craft show I would never expect it to be at the most 30.00. This is a major rip off. My board as unstained places which in no way is the grain of the wood. It is a board with 2 pieces of wood nailed on each end with 2 cheap handles. No idea how the initial and decoration was added. But it had no depth and appears willl easily fade with cleaning. I was planning even at the high price to give my family members each one for Christmas. Not now. Maybe my board is defective and if the seller sees and reads this and is willing to make me one that does not look like it was made by 5 year old then my mind could be changed. But for now I can only say do not waste your money. It is a high price rip off,Negative
this product is trash i was very dissapointed do not buy this product you will regret it plastic trash nothing like whats shown for discription,Negative
"Doesn’t make sense? Not a picture of the Patent.  This is misleading. Across the top, there is the words “Mickey mouse patent” in large letters, but what is behind it is just a dictionary page image of where the word “Patent” would fall.  It’s dumb. I’m disappointed and they have somehow hidden all of their reviews that aren’t 5 stars.",Negative

Cheap I bought these earnings for my husband.  They looked very nice but didn’t last long they ended up breaking in a month. The stone fell out and the pin that goes in your ear fell right through where the stone goes. Not made well. Sad cause they are not that cheap of a price to not last longer than a month. I wouldn’t buy them again sadly. Don’t recommend.,Negative
Big nope Impossible to put on,Negative

"Good concept I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip. Never got a chance to actually wear them but hoping to replace the post with a plastic rod, if I can find the right size.",Negative
Rip Off. They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.,Negative
"I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...??

Obviously they are just a pressed imprint which is still pretty cool however I got my set with only two different prints. I got 4 all the same and then 1 single. Also i chose to out mod podge ocer these so that the wood woulsnt stain so much. Cool set but really not worth what I paid .,Negative

False advertising This is the second item I had tried to purchase that advertises that it is sterling silver it turned my real sterling silver chain black and my whole chest gray I returned it,Negative
Small The picture makes these earrings seem much bigger than they are. The size was hard to find in the description. These would be okay for a small child.,Negative
"Cost and Quality This product is literally garbage.  It looks like someone scoured old construction sites until they found a piece of water warped plywood that they could use to make this sign.  It's less than 1/4 inch thick, has no attachments for hanging it, but it wont hang anyway because it's so warped.  Waste of money.",Negative

"Dissatisfied It was cheap looking, no detailing and wording was thinly stamped on. Towel was not squared up and hemming was ragged!",Negative
"Meh... I personalized these, keeping in mind the limited number of letters that are allowed in the edit. I did not get what I asked for. Seller did not communicate or contact me that my order could not be made even though I did not go over the letter count.  The seller should just ask for a name and age and not give false hope with false customization claims. These also appear glossy online but are just black and yellow ink on a dull matte finish.",Negative
18x24. It was 4 times bigger than the product specifications said. I was told it would be 8.5x11 and it came 18x24. I ordered a frame for it and now I can't use it because the frame is too small.,Negative

Hopefully I won't mess it up. Lesson learned! Just thought I'd share from experience.",Negative
"Producer tries to save 3 cents per unit for profit and leads to sub standard product I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..",Negative

Not tiny in diameter and not real metal This is most definitely not surgical grade metal. The color wore off by day 4 and now my nose piercing which I’ve had for years is painful and irritated.

They wouldn’t return or exchange the sweatshirt for the correct one and I couldn’t find proof anywhere that I put 2023. I ordered ANOTHER one for 2022 and still received a 2023 shirt. Sad because I was really looking forward to this sweatshirt.,Negative

TO BAD I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.,Negative
Totally disappointed The item looks cool but the sound isn’t even scary. It sounds like a loud whisper with a slight screech. A co-worker told me he thought his truck had a punctured tire.,Negative

"Eh. . . So I guess I should have assumed this was going to be a quick fix until I find another one to replace it, but oh well. This is a small “gold” hoop that will need to be “twisted” to open and again to secure it to your piercing. I’m not a huge fan since it will not ever fully seal closed. The material is very thin (20 gauge) but because it is so small it’s a bit sharp feeling if it gets slightly tugged by my hair.",Negative

Don't waste your money Got one as a gift. Wore it one time and it came off because the velcro wasn't enough to keep it attached. Now I have to buy a new Fitbit because I lost it when it fell off,Negative
Ears became very irritated afterwards and metal is not very strong I used there's for first and second lobe piercings and just putting them in was quite difficult considering the small size and bending them to put them in felt like they were going to snap.<br /> I had them in for about 2 days and they were extremely irritated and swollen by that point and very difficult to take out.<br />I have skin allergies but considering they're stainless steel this should not have happened. If you do not have sensitive skin or smaller lobes then this may work better for you but I would not reccomend.,Negative

"Don't Bother Item was much smaller than described. The ""diamonds"" were actually nonexistant. It was THAT small!<br />I tried to return it and the seller accepted my request. What wasn't mentioned was that the return shipping fee was $50!  Definitely NOT worth the price paid!",Negative
"Not terrible So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.",Negative
Terrible It’s crap,Negative
Save your money Looks like the ones advertised are the best ones. The ones I got are very light. I doubt this is silver. More like aluminum with a silver stamp. Save your money. Even the gold “vermeil” is questionable. It fades after five wears or one if you use soap. It fades. Not with the money for this clown jewelry. Totally fake looking in real life.,Negative
Nada Muy frágiles,Negative
"Pretty but doesn’t stick well Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.",Negative
It's ok The bottom half wasn't covered that well in the red glitter so it's very patchy under the resin.,Negative
Intentionally Deceptive but okay product These are not spheres. Every picture is made to make them look like Christmas ball ornaments. They are NOT.  They are round like a tennis ball from the front and back but almost flat.<br /><br />One star for being full of garbage. Every single picture - not one shows from the side. So no one thinks they have an actual side. Dirty.,Negative
"Sharp edges cut nose The ends of this nose ring are very sharp, and it cuts your nose. They are not finished and you can’t get it in your nose without cutting your nose when you try to put it in. Would not recommend.",Negative

Cheap Amateur print Product print is full looks cheap not glitter on image as shown in sample,Negative
Not worth it Picture implies that the print is a cut out but when I received the item it was printed on a piece of paper. Not worth the money.,Negative
"No, not really for me... Very rough.  I used it on my face and took me two days to rehydrate.  Not what I expected.",Negative

"Do not buy!!! This was the most disappointing bath bomb ever.  Besides arriving cracked in half, the integrity was poor and not consistent with the pictures of a distinct cloud.  When placed in water, there was minimal fizzing and no distinctive colors emitted.  Dissolved completely in about 30 seconds.  Certainly not worth the cost.  I bought it for my 3yo son and it was more of a negative experience than if I hadn’t gotten anything at all.",Negative
It's a larger hoop Wanted to like it but it was a big hoop for my nose..,Negative
"Blown up picture I could have printed myself This item came in a flimsy cardboard envelope. I opened it and it was just a blown up print I could have downloaded and printed my self for less than $1. The quality is horrible and the wording is slightly fuzzy. It doesn't come with a frame, just so you know.",Negative
Faded very quickly This plate has already faded to the point where you cannot see it. Very poor quality,Negative
Thought it would be easy to put on It was really awfully hard to put on,Negative
Stones fell out This necklace looked very nice but the stones started falling out the first time I wore it.,Negative
"I like the essential oil scent I was so excited to try this deodorant, especially after reading the 5 star reviews. Unfortunately, this one doesn’t doesn’t help squash the pit stink at all for me. I had to reapply after 3 hours, again at 6 hours, and by dinner time I needed to wash my armpits and start over. I have been using a different brand of natural deodorant for 3 years, and felt that it was time to change things up, but this deodorant is not the solution for me. I like the essential oil scent, but it’s not enough to mask the stink.",Negative
Fake Fake Lang don't buy this crap!,Negative
"Irritated 5 year old piercing I really wanted to love this, so dainty & easy to shape but I cannot wear it a day without it irritating my nose. I’ve never had issues with this piercing, but every time I’ve put it in the next morning I have to take it out as my nose gets red and swollen/painful. Similarly priced jewelry has never done this.",Negative
This is more like a $10 item so thin it broke when I was taking it out of the box. Not at all what I expected for the price. This is more like a $10 item.,Negative
"3d printed plastic This was a present for a friend, broke almost immediately.",Negative
"Not great, needs a lot of alterations. The crown looks pretty decent, but parts of the print had holes and one of the crown points is tilted in toward the body of the crown. I filled these in with hot glue. I expect it will look very good once I sand and paint it though.<br /><br />Three stars since I wasn't comfortable sanding and painting outside of the box.<br /><br />EDIT: Since my review, one of the not reinforced crown points has begun to fall off. This seems to be lower quality than I initially thought.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product at all.",Negative
"Very thin and fragile. Arrived broken Very pretty sign, bought as alternative guestbook for my wedding in July. However, it arrived late and broken. Tried to contact the seller and couldn’t. I’m hoping wood glue will hold this together.",Negative
"Great throw - lasts 5 minutes though :( I love the description - Highly Scented!  Yeah, til you burn them.  I loved the scent of this wax melt but when I put it it the burner, I got a strong scent for five minutes and then it smelled like wax right after that.  What’s the point?  I buy a lot of wax melts but won’t be buying this brand again.",Negative
Save your money Very poor quality - it fell apart the same day we received it.,Negative
"No fragrance What a disappointment.  I just got my order today and was looking forward this body powder. (Nantucket)  Absolutely no fragrance.  For this price, and not even a powder puff, I had bigger expectations.  Perhaps this is why there have been no reviews.",Negative

"No Color! Nothing like the photo, and although I understand that stones come in natural variations the one I was sent isn't attractive at all, mostly solid white and nothing I want to wear or create jewelry with.  Not worth $1.",Negative
"Do not purchase The seller does not do color so you are unable to see the design easily because it is the same color as the band, I got a white one you can not make out that it has anything on it",Negative
Missing product I love the art but I'm very upset that one of the portats is missing from my package. It advertises 3 but I only received 2,Negative
Quick shipping It's a unique ornament for my lab loving daughter but  the hanger was not put on properly (through the silver ring so the ornament will hang properly) and upside down. Hanger was also scratched up and bent.,Negative
Quarter coin ring You get what you pay for! Lesson I need to learn,Negative
"Way too short in length. What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.",Negative
Beautiful but broke while wearing them the 3rd time I wore these out to dinner and when we got home I noticed one had broken and fallen off. So disappointing because I really liked them.,Negative

"Cheap I ordered an XL, I am normally a 2X in women’s tops or a size 16 for reference. The shirt fit great but the image on the shirt was half the size expected. It made the shirt look super cheap and the only reason why I didn’t return it was because I got it the day before I actually needed and I had no other option. It works fine for a one day use. I needed it for my sons Toy Story B’Day theme. If the image was as shown It would have been a shirt I worn regularly. Very disappointing.",Negative
"Not worth the money The words are faded and blurry. Cheap material and you can find bigger and better quality pictures in Burlington, Home Goods, Kirkland or Marshalls for less. Save your money",Negative
Avoid It literally fell out of my nostril after blowing my nose ONCE and my piercing closed.,Negative

Ehh Bought this for a Christmas gift for a co worker. I can say I am a bit disappointed in the actual size of the air fresheners. They could be a little bigger. I would say they are maybe half the size of one of those Christmas tree air fresheners. It's a gag gift. Can't say I would recommend or buy again.,Negative
Buyer Beware This product was poor quality and not as described.,Negative
Cute but…. Broken before I got it,Negative

"Pleased to disappointed in two short months... I loved this necklace when I got it, and have gotten many compliments on it.  But now two months later the plating has almost all but rubbed off.  I will admit I didn't see the warning in the item description advising not to wear it while doing anything that might make you sweat, but I didn't wear it while working out or anything.  Just regular, casual wear and not even every day - part of my jewelry rotation of every other day or every two days or so.  It wasn't expensive but now I can't even wear something that was purchased because it had meaning for me.",Negative
"It is NOT ""precision fit"" It is ""cut to fit"" Major disappointment.  When the ""cut to fit"" stickers arrived I could have screamed !<br />For the price I paid , i expected what the listing said, ""precision cut"" for the Outback.<br />Good quality sticker, will give them that .

"Just make sure you have someone to fasten these for you... I had these for quite a long time, 8mm size. Looked great, very comfortable. Had to remove them for surgery recently. They were lost so I ordered new ones. After literally countless attempts at fastening them to wear, they are all bent and the earrings never did get fastened. Didn’t have any help, so the cost of the bent up earrings is frustrating. Wouldn’t buy them again for this reason.",Negative
Just Print on-line Just don't waste your $s.,Negative
This doesn’t function like it should This bow has no drawback and you can’t get it to properly shoot an arrow. My son has owned a similar bow before but the string was made of actual rubber and worked way better. This was a waste of money.,Negative
Too small. I wore these to sleep. One came out while I was sleeping and I can't find it at all. These are so tiny. Its a bit of a bummer to spend almost $20 on earrings that are so small. Other reviewers are right - these aren't at all like the shapes in the pictures. Not a fan.,Negative

One of them arrived with a small scratch, but I didn't want to wait for a new tag to come in.  I don't think they're going to hold up very long since they scratch so easy.  They're super cute and I really love them, but with very minimally amounts of wear they are already looking a little rough. ):",Negative
Didn’t get the right size chain I paid the extra 3.00 for the 19’ chain and I didn’t get that. It’s still the small chain. I like the necklace just upset I didn’t get what I paid for. I wanted a longer chain so I could wear this necklace with another one but I can’t it’s not long enough.,Negative

"4 Stone Mother's Birthstone ring I ordered this as a Mother's Day gift from hubby  The product arrived quickly, however when I placed it on my finger it looked extremely cheap. I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.",Negative

Not happy I called and asked to have my sons name engraved then below his name I wanted  the words Hell Yeah below his name. What did I get everything in one line. I made it a point to call with instructions on how I wanted it. I expected to get what I paid for. Totally unhappy.,Negative
"Item I received looked nothing like what I received.  Item sold was not as advertised. This ornament looks nothing like what was advertised which is the side profile of the dog running.

"DOESN'T WORK The Hardwood Tortilla Press looks beautiful, with fine workmanship and all. There is only one problem - IT DOESN'T WORK! It flattens the dough to about a 3 and 1/2 inch circle, and that is it -- the rest we had to roll out by hand. I was incredibly disappointed by this product, and would be quite anxious to know what all of those folks who submitted 5-star reviews were smoking.... maybe I can order that, instead!",Negative
Horrible Can't smell them at all,Negative
It a resin not actual stone Resin- not actual stone or rock,Negative
Don’t waste your money! I felt disappointed! Very poor construction and wood isn’t really a hard wood. More like birdhouse wood. Small sign and the color is way off from the picture.<br />Don’t waste your money!,Negative
"Can barely read name on ring... I ordered the silver ring for my wife, but our daughter’s name that I asked to be put on it can barely be read. Several other people have commented on this so we are not alone. It does NOT even look remotely close to the advertised picture. Very disappointed in my purchase. I guess I will be buying another one from somewhere else.",Negative
Pictures are Deceiving Pictures are deceiving and so is product description.  The bracelet is extremely thin and it bent out of shape simply putting it on. It would become misshapen I'm sure when wearing. Very thin and malleable.  Doesn't look or feel anything like it was described.  So disappointed. Returning it.,Negative
Too small Make sure to check size. They are very small. Not as pictured,Negative
Pretty but pricey It was very small for the price I should've paid attention to the size n price because I can go local n get much cheaper n bigger but the product is pretty and different,Negative
Horrible!! Not as pictured. Scent is not strong and doesn't smell good. It was falling apart inside the package. I'm just going to throw it away.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLEASE!,Negative

"Don’t waste your money! This is a truly terrible product! So poorly created. The images are cute, but they’re impossible to remove the sticker from the paper without ripping the entire sticker. I was able to salvage 16 stickers, the rest ripped and went right in the garbage. The break in the paper should make them easy peel in theory, but in actuality not the case. Very disappointed that I spent $10 on these stickers. Save your money, or just throw $10 in the trash.",Negative
They were okay First ones ordered  came apart.  Replacement: box smashed posts bent.  Rather disappointing,Negative
I'm sorry I wasted my money. Completely disappointed. I ordered a 23 in a $85 wall art of a pitbull in a dark Rusty copper. For my son who is in Florida. After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.,Negative

It doesn’t lay flat on your wrists and therefore always locks up and doesn’t allow my watch to track properly. I don’t wear it. :( very disappointing",Negative
A disappointment. I am very disappointed by this product. The letters are not as neat as they pictures show. My daughters name starts with a M and the M has thick mountains which make it look very cheap. I am upset with myself for spending this much money on this.,Negative
Received a damaged sign Awaiting an answer on how we can fix it need it for my wedding in 4 days 😭will update<br /><br />Update no one ever reached out!<br /><br />Order in advance advance it’s not solid wood so it’s very fragile especially depending on your font and name!,Negative

"Will give you an infection, and will turn green. When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.",Negative

Broken It came cracked nearly in half in one spot. So not impressed,Negative
"Disappointed They cost as much or more than a 78 card deck though there are only 15 cards. Doesn't beak down time very far. Within a week is smallest time, within 5 years largest time frame. Also has 6 cards of the 15 that say do it, wait etc.. Barely more than a magic 8 ball. I was a bit disappointed.<br />Though they came wrapped nicely.",Negative
"arrived broken I waited for this necklace for 3 weeks. While unwrapping it, I noticed several pieces. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and some how was still shattered. I spent an hour with a bottle of super glue trying to put it back together, as it was a gift. It could have been beautiful, but even with all the work putting it back together it looked awful. I would not recommend this product.",Negative
"I really like the bracelet, but the inscription is unlegible you can barely read it Can not read the word twin that I had inscribed.",Negative
Absolutely beautiful stone The chain is copper and the pendant is fixed to the cheap chain.  So pass it up until they up the ante.,Negative
its real real small not what I thought it was,Negative
"Too clumpy It came all clumped up, it would not move around. Very disappointed especially as I purchased it as a gift.",Negative
"Huge & Not What Expected I tried to return this item and was refused by the manufacturer. The size is not something I want to put on my tree or to give as a gift, which was my intention. It looks out of proportion to a normal sized ornament and now I have no use for it. Unless you want a huge piece of cut wood with your dog’s name on it, get something else. Which is what I had to do. Very disappointing!",Negative
Cheap Nothing special. Sent it back. Looks cheap,Negative
"Really 14k? Made my skin react :( I specifically bought this because my skin reacts poorly to anything other than gold, silver or surgical steel. I'd like to believe this is truly 14K gold filled, but my nose got inflamed and irritated after wearing it for one night. Maybe it's 14K gold filled with some kind of plating on the outside... I don't know. I've had my nose pierced for 12 years and haven't reacted to 14K gold before, so not sure what happened here. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this.",Negative
Silver hoop I really wanted to wear the small hoops to hoops and each air they’re very comfortable however to close down is difficult there was always a gap behind my ear which would snag my long hair or a sweater that I was getting into and that was a pain or hooking on a scarf I wish I never spent the money on these,Negative
Cheap The quality was poor. Utensils were stained & the personalization was faded on the majority of them.,Negative
One Star They look cheap,Negative
Impossible to install Very well made but because of size very difficult to install always bubbles,Negative
"Reasonable for price This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better",Negative
Writing fades quickly It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.,Negative
Small I would make sure you buy the biggest size because for 17 bucks you get a tiny sticker which in my opinion is not worth it for the price!,Negative

"Not with the price Although they are pretty when viewing them on one side, regardless of which ear you put them in, they look backwards when you put them on and they are tiny. They are definitely not worth the price and look like children’s earrings. I wouldn’t have paid more than $30 for them.",Negative
Poor quality - junk go elsewhere The product is really poor quality. Just blocks of wood with adhesive letters that come from. Three arrived damaged and they were mailed so poorly that the package was ripped and blocks were sticking out. For the money the vendor charges for the product and the shipping I strongly suggest you go elsewhere or got to a craft store and do it yourself. I am disgusted.,Negative
False advertising Didn’t have post to wear it’s like a cuff,Negative
"Alright... I Didn't realize when I chose a thread color that it would all be that color. I chose navy and even the flowers were in navy. I figured the flowers would stay pink (like in the listing picture). Also, the flowers in the picture are different (and are way better looking) than the flowers on the one I received. I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.",Negative
People with allergies beware! Good if you don’t have metal allergies. I’m allergic to non silver or non gold jewelry. Wore this for 3 days and I have blistered hives all around my neck. This is the worst allergic reaction I’ve ever had to jewelry. Only buy if you can wear any metal.,Negative
"Not a good quality Not what I expected-not very sturdy and too thin. Will not bend to tighten up. Therefore, it comes off easily. Not happy with it at all. Would not recommend.",Negative
"How To Adjust Nice necklace but the thingy that I suspect adjusts the the length on your neck won’t move. The chain is too delicate to force it.  If I can’t figure it out soon, I’m returning this necklace.",Negative

"Strong pass (1) It took over a month to receive<br />(2) Poor quality, it bins and the color changed after getting wet.",Negative
Not what I expected! For the price I paid I was expecting a Sterling silver chain. Was not very disappointing. Giftable but who wants a necklace that is going to change color because it’s fake silver. Not me. Pretty but upgrade to Sterling and I’m sure you’ll have a much greater turn around. Aloha!,Negative
Great neckless but miss print It’s a great necklace but the birth stones were placed in the wrong names.,Negative

No earrings in the box Quite disappointed to received a well packaged box with NO earrings… only a pair of earring backs…. Returning it now….,Negative
Looks good but super small. The sticker was nice and high quality but so much smaller then we thought.  I wish I work of read the size better.  For $11 it’s a ripoff for how small it is.,Negative
Cute but have to get frame for it Very cute but did not realize it was only a sheet of photo paper. For some reason I thought it was on tin and could hang it up on its own. Have to find a picture frame for it.,Negative
Was not happy It turned my baby arm colors,Negative
"This is cheaply made I spent over 100.00 on this. I thought it was engraved writing but instead it’s a cheap sticker for the letters. The sticker was bubbled and lifting up on some of the letters.<br />I bought for a wedding gift, I’m embarrassed to give the newly wed couple this.<br />Don’t waste your money",Negative
Not worth the price These earrings are no where near worth what I paid from them. It is as if I got them at the dollar stores,Negative

Didn't even make it a month On my wrist one night in the theater and the beads started rolling off like overflowing popcorn from an overfilled container.  Disappointed.,Negative
Not as pictured Not at pictured.  Plain white glossy paper.  No edging as pictured.  Very expensive for what it is.,Negative
Not the best I had to pay shipping for another one because the original broke trying to get it off the cardboard. Way too much glue used for shipping.,Negative
Very Disappointing Was not as elegant looking. More like macrame<br />Too expensive for poor quality,Negative
"DO NOT BUY Please save your money and time and do not buy this piece. The quality of the product is very poor and is NOT worth the money being charged. You can find better for much cheaper. To makes this worse, the seller will not approve of a return despite the quality of item being a huge disappointment. Very disappointed and do not want someone else to go through this.",Negative
"One Star Very cheaply made. Flimsy plastic, not chalkboard material as described. Sending it back immediately.",Negative
Decal is peeling Decal is peeling after minimal use and hand washing only,Negative
Not worth the money Product arrived a week after scheduled. Charm is so tiny you can’t tell what it is.,Negative
"Doesn't work Tried it on muscle back pain,  didn't work. Tried it on headache, alleviated a bit.  Also, container is not easy to use when trying to rub it on your side, for instance, because you have to keep your finger pushing the roll because otherwise, as you rub, it slides close again.",Negative
Do not buy this if you looking for good quality earnings This is not good sterling silver it get dark and my ear starts itching doesn’t worth the price,Negative

"Fell apart first use I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.",Negative
"Works but not for long Very cute cozy and works well to protect the hands from heat.  However, after a few weeks of use it is very stretched out and sits just under the lip of the cup instead of around the middle of the cup where it belongs.

The sign was gifted and hung outside on August 18 and today is Sept. 17 and the sign is ready for the garbage can after just 30 days.

Needs to be put together better Both frames were loosely put together.  One side on both frames were not flush put together.  There was a visible gap in the wood.,Negative
"Not as high quality as advertised The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.",Negative

I like it I bought this for my daughters birthday I really like it. My only issue is I don’t feel it’s worth the price it’s not really all that big but it turned out pretty I just think something like that should not cost as much as It did so I only gave it 2 stars because of the pricing,Negative

"Customize Option You need to have a customize option on all your canes that it's available on. Put it in a tab before you place your order. I love the look of this cane and in the description, it tells you that you can choose from several colors and lengths. also, either brass/gold or silver hardware. But when I went to order this item, it was just going to send the 36” walnut. It becomes a huge hassle. I noticed that you had a customize option button on another one of your canes. It fit the description of the item perfectly. This cane, and many of your others say one thing but don't offer that option. ( Even though it tells you it's available.) I would just make it simple for the customer, either change the description to one stature or put that button on all of your items that have the description offered. It would ensure the customer has some choices and received the product they truly want. Also, would save you guys time on returning messages and having returned items. This means more revenue for your bottom line with less time invested to do so. I need a 37-1/2” to 38” cane. This would hurt my back to use at 36” for a prolonged period. You make a fantastic product, change this one small thing and I myself would have purchased several of your canes alone. Thank you for your time.",Negative
"Very cheap So yes, they are cheap in price but you get what you juyst for. Three come in the package which is nice because the first I used immediately broke so I had two more to replace it. However, they are both gone now too.<br /><br />Very cute charms but all three are lost now.",Negative

"Impossible to get in my ear If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.",Negative

"save your money I have never given such bad ratings but guess there is always a first time to everything. I am struggling to find things that is good about the nail paints. They are one of the most streakiest, thick, and aweful to layer nail polishes I have every worn in my life.. save your money.",Negative
Not worth the money  not good Dislike,Negative
"Soooo light Loved the pic!  I didnt know about ""Only good for polyester. "" Transferred to cotton and was very dim.  Picture itself is very light to begin with.  I ended up highlighting and repainting with my material paints.  It turned out really well with a lot of effort.  I wont buy from this company again.",Negative
Not worth money cheaply made Wore for one week and initial cams off of bracelet. Cheaply made.,Negative
"Not for longevity. Cute design, however...the chain turned a copper color after the 3rd wear.",Negative
Cheap Super cheap,Negative
"Way to Expensive for the quality! They are a lot smaller than I thought they would be, and the hangers are really thin and easy to bend.  I don't think their worth the $14.00 you pay after shipping charges. I can't decide if I want to return them because you have to pay to ship them back!",Negative
"Color is a bit off Received as a thoughtful gift from the hubby and my 2 boys.  Cute design,but the gold color is a bit more brassy or reddish than the yellow gold color in the picture.  Would not have purchased if I had seen it in person first.",Negative
"Disappointed I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!",Negative
Not adequately made Very pretty and dainty but poor craftsmanship. Wasn’t properly soldered where clasp is attached and fell off while Christmas shopping. Wasted $350+ for someone else to enjoy or sell.,Negative

"Worst Product Ever!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! First of all they stated they shipped my product weeks before they actually did, I had to contact Amazon before they actually shipped it! Then I receive the product and as I am trying right now to put the decal on my car, the contact paper is crap! I have put so many decals on my car, I’m a pro at it, it took so much work to release this decal from this cover paper they use to put it on my freshly cleaned window for it NOT TO EVEN TRY TO STICK TO MY WINDOW, like not at all!!!",Negative
Rude name insult to women! Really? Using that title as advertising for women?,Negative
"Unique Item But You Will Need Patience Before purchasing, be sure to click above on ""Take It Personal"" where it says ""Ships from and sold by Take it Personal"" and read about all of the shipping issues. Don't expect to get it right away. It's definitely a unique pet ID tag, but I felt the writing was too big and it looked crowded, even though it was just my dog's name and my phone number. I also ordered three colors, but they made the face white, which I wasn't expecting and didn't want. Maybe I overlooked that in the instructions.",Negative

I didn't like them The stickers were too small. I have returned them,Negative
Waste of money. Should have read discription Guess I should have read the description. Literally $15 for a picture pritened on a peice of paper. I could have done that myself for way cheaper. Plus I thought they were printed on canvases and now I have to go spend more money for frames.,Negative
It's nothing special. The paper printed on was just a regular piece of paper I could have done myself.<br /><br />Won't be coming back to this seller.,Negative
Defective cheap wood There are multiple flaws in the craftsmanship . Black marks that were very noticeable in multiple areas. There were multiple splinters in the crevices as well. Wood is thin . Seller agreed to a return with a “ restocking fee”. This was a gift that I am unable to give. Very disappointed.,Negative
Seller requested customization was ignored. This asked me to provide specifications. I did. They weren't followed. You'll also need pliers.,Negative
cheap and thin metal stakes bend when trying to put into the ground. not worth $40. I should of spent $120 for cast iron or wrought iron.<br />can hardly read the address number due to black lettering and no back round.,Negative
Great quote but... Her facial expression is not... I mean... it looks like she her stomach hurts and she needs to excuse herself to use the restroom in the middle of a sensitive conversation.,Negative
Never again I can not wear it. It pinches my neck and I can’t get my refund because I have no way to print the return label,Negative
The good side was the sticky side The size was right but the good side had the sticky glue so unless you are putting it under glass it is useless<br />However I sent an email and was promptly refunded for the purchase,Negative

Poor Quality Dont waste your money. Its extreamly over priced. Poor quality for $65.00,Negative
"Not exactly as described, but cute. The pendant is cute, however is much more bright silver colored than the “antique” finish it was advertised to be. Also, the chain comes on is extremely lightweight and flimsy. I just use this charm with the chain I have from another necklace.",Negative

Damaged Arrived late and damaged,Negative
"Excellent Idea, Poorly Executed I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say ""This is ok""<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said ""This is ok""  Well it wasnt ""OK"" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.",Negative
"Two Stars To small, gave them away.",Negative
Do not buy I don’t even know why it would cost so much for 1oz. I can make this myself and save a boatload of time and they hid my review with the sensitivity filter.,Negative

"I should've read the fine print I was very disappointed to see this wasn't a plaque or anything,  just a print out on photo paper which I could've done myself.  However,  I didn't pay enough attention to the details because I was eager to order it to complete my bathroom decor.",Negative

"Chain is Sterling Silver, ball chime is not! Beautiful Sterling Silver chain but the main feature of this necklace, the Harmony Ball, is NOT Sterling Silver. It is tarnishing after just a few weeks of wear. I've tried to polish it with Sterling silver paste with no improvement. Very disappointed.",Negative
Arrived broken.  ,Negative
"Terrible quality and arrived damaged So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. ""Rustic"" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.",Negative
Not worth the price These should be 2 for $1 considering that they look like printed images like one hour pharmacy type images,Negative
Missing Missing 2 pages. Also the page were cut weird and on thin paper,Negative
"Not Unisex sizing Absolutely purchase this T shirt if you are a size 00. It is darling, to be sure. But Unisex sizing? No way.  An american Unisex small has always been my go to size. Not fitted, but not super loose. Enough room to fit the girls in without having them scream at you, you know?<br />I ordered a unisex Small, and I'm quite sure it is for a 12 year old boy. Some baseball moms love to have their ta-tas do the talking, I'm not that mom. Quietly melting into the background is more my style. This shirt will have any mom being the center of attention, to be sure.  Not only will your boobies look enormous, as this cheap fabric is stretched to it's breaking point, you get the added benefit of a crop top, so when you sit on those bleachers, your entire crack will be skillfully displayed to all of the curious on-lookers in the seats above you.<br /><br />Basically. Order 3 sizes up.  Or better yet, maybe don't order at all. There are no exchanges, and no prime shipping. There are plenty of other shirts just like this with better prices, better customer service and free shipping.",Negative

"Cheap quality Although this sign is cute,  it’s very very cheaply made. It’s just a very thin two by four with stenciled paint on it.  Prob costs about 2.00 to make. I’m keeping it as it’s too much trouble to return. It is cute but not worth the 30 bucks I paid.",Negative

Order mix up Got wrong color sweatshirt order sand and got gray and tex on sweater was supposed to be white and is not other wise nice production was right color,Negative
Not highly scented as claimed Purchased this on the claim it was highly scented. Perhaps I received a defective one but my wax melt had little to no smell at all. I kept waiting for the scent to fill the room and it never happened. Clearly disappointed for the price. I'll stick with the 2.00 ones at the major stores; at least I know those do their job.,Negative
Cheap print THIS WAS PRINTED ON NORMAL STOCK PAPER. NO GLOSS OR ANYTHING! BETTER TO PRINT AT A WALGREENS THEN ORDER FROM HERE.,Negative
Picture paper Cheap looking,Negative
Printing too faint. The printing is so faint that after two months it is unreadable.  Save your money.  It will be of no use if your pet is lost.  The people who find it won't be able to read the tag to contact you.,Negative
Small Way too small,Negative
Nope Kids size and thin material.,Negative
Not what I expected They’re like using threaded earrings - terrible for your skin. They’re causing soreness and irritation/inflammation. Definitely worth it to pay a dollar or two more on Etsy for a better hoop.,Negative

"Placemat unsatisfactory Although the print is pretty, the &#34;placemat&#34; seems to be just two pieces cut from a tablecloth and sewn together back-to-back.  Plus, I assumed the order would include four placemats, but I only received one.  I submitted a request for returning it to Amazon, and received a reply that they would contact the vendor.  That was several days ago, so I am definitely not satisfied.",Negative
"Doesn't work I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the ""clasp"" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.",Negative
Meh Super cute! But too small and it pinched the inside of my nosewhen I tried to close it,Negative
Posts too long I love the principle of screw on backs but the posts are so long the earrings stick out too far.,Negative
Name holder The product kept sliding down the stethoscope so it makes it very irritating!,Negative
"Meh The back of one of the earrings were bent. And the butterfly’s were paper, like maybe glued on? But definitely paper. I just threw them away.",Negative
Ok but not what I thought. Not the best product. Itchy and too big. Not what I thought. I guess it was my mistake.,Negative
Slope Angle The slope of the hanger creates an angle that you can’t even hang anything on this hanger.  Nothing stands on it.,Negative
"Item received different than advertised Was very excited when I found this bracelet for sale. Upon receipt of the item though, I was extremely disappointed with it. The color of the bracelet I received is considerably lighter than the amber colored bracelet advertised. I would love for the seller to replace it with a bracelet that has more amber colored beads!",Negative
One Star The wire is too thick to fit through the holes in my ears.,Negative
Don’t bother. Very cheaply done. Engraving is very shallow and basic. Not the gift I’d be proud to give.,Negative
No extender No chain extender is actually included despite being in the description several times,Negative
Magnets are too strong I ended up returning this bag because the magnetic snaps that hold the bag closed pulled out of the leather because they are so strong.,Negative
Plastic not metal Looks nice but is plastic not metal.  Not sure why it advertises to be metal when it is plastic.,Negative
Not the correct item Working item was sent.,Negative
Wont give you a full refund Don’t buy! Shirt did not fit correctly and I returned it. I bought this shirt for $28 and refunded $16. Plus I had to spend $8 to ship it back myself. So I only got back $8. Don’t buy! If you need to return it you’ll lose money!,Negative

Very disappointed! This picture suggests that this is a roll of decals. It isn't. I received one decal and it cost me $9.00. I am so frustrated. This was supposed to be a stocking stuffer. Very disappointed!,Negative
Poor Quality I was completely aware that the frames were not included but I was surprised to see the quality of these pictures. It looks like they printed it out from their home computer on regular paper. I could have done just as good on my own printer and saved A LOT of money! Very dissatisfied.,Negative
Don't buy! Hahaha definitely not a toe ring!,Negative
Questionable This peeled off within a week.  Seller said they would replace it but never did.,Negative
Wish I would've known it was 3D printed 3D printed.  Seems like prototype quality or less.  I highly doubt it's food safe.,Negative

"Awful My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 ""boba"" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.",Negative
"Credit/Debit cards, Driver's license won't fit in pockets making it unusable I just received my leather wallet with custom engraving. Though I like the rustic design and rather lack of finish this has a major flaw that makes it unusable. The credit cards don't fit, it's not a thickness issue as my driver's license doesn't fit either. The pockets are not wide enough which makes me think this one wasn't made properly as the one in the picture has cards in it. If I try to force the card down I'll damage it so not sure what to do wtih this wallet now but definitely back to square one and keep searching for a wallet.",Negative

"Correct sizing and soft materisl The size was way off! Original ordered a medium, it looks like a kids…. Then I ordered a large and still looks like a kid…. Didn’t even wash or dry the medium and I may as well paint it on…. The material is stiff…. Extremely disappointed!",Negative
"Misleading and not all that much bang for your buck Pretty misleading honestly from the pictures. I thought I was getting all the colors shown, but there was just the one redwood. It is shown but I dont like it, it looks like a faded red. Its soft and okay ribbon, but I wouldnt spend $11 on it, especially when it's only 5 yards. You have to look at the details on this item and I didnt and I'm sorry I didnt. I tried to return the item before it shipped and nothing happened. I'm not gonna buy from them again but I dont put all the blame on them for me being dumb.",Negative
"NOT A TOWEL Was excited and can’t wait to see it. Open the package and was in shock and big disappointment, it is just a sheet with printed Justin Timberlake on it. This is not even a towel! Look very cheap too.",Negative
Not worth it Really unhappy they look scratch and dull it’s just not the quality I thought I’d be getting.,Negative
"$15.00 for a roll of T-paper w/some heated ""stickers"" on the front? This is a rip-off, seriously!  I know the description states the design/text is only on one sheet of the roll and is not a ""sticker"" but they sure do seem like stickers to me, whether they're ""heat-pressed"" or not, the price is absolutely ridiculous, or ""highway robbery"" like my parents used to say!  Even if the seller charged a more reasonable price (like 1/2), they'd still be making quite a profit as the price of $15.00 for one roll with heat-pressed stickers is incredibly exorbitant!",Negative
One Star kind of dull,Negative
Too thin Very thin socks- not worth it,Negative
Beware Do not buy this. It is a one sided 8 X 10 document that is not worth the price.,Negative
Toooo Tiny It’s too tiny.. Not fit for adults. The clasp is also lose for one earring. Too much hassle to return so kept it.,Negative
Bad quality There is text printed over text. I had a replacement sent and still had the same problem and just returned for refund.,Negative
Packaging Sucks Arrived in a broken package so after opening the yellow mailer confetti spewed all over my living room. It also looks nothing like the photo. They are all the same mm sized pieces and none of them have a shimmer.,Negative
"Seller ignored my inquiries to their mistake. I ordered 2 of these. One for me and 1 for my work bestie. We have different names and I placed the order accordingly. I got 2 shirts with HER name and 0 shirts with my name. The seller ignored my messages to discuss the order, mistake, and what we could do moving forward. Tee is cute and comfy, but the seller hides from mistakes.",Negative
"Product was Severely Damaged As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open. The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY! On another note: at least the driver followed instructions! Good on them!",Negative

"Very pretty but gold finish has worn off They were a pretty gold color when I got them, but after a few months, they are a dull silvery color. Maybe it’s my fault for wearing them continuously, including in the shower. They are very lightweight.",Negative
"Very disappointed. I ordered from  Country barn babe because  all the reviews were great and all five stars. I guess I didn't have as good a luck. Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.",Negative

Terrible Workmanship I purchased this product unfinished and was sent a wood filled not completed product. Then was told look at the pictures on the site when asked for a return.

"Great potential, falls short These wax melts are advertised as being vapor rub scented which should, in theory, help when you're congested and need a little relief. Great idea which is why I purchased them. In reality, the sent of these wax melts is so faint I can barely smell them when I stick my nose right up to the was warmer. Even then, the vapor rub smell is ineffective. I hope this vendor will work to improve the product but until such time as that happens, it's not worth purchasing.",Negative

"Disappointed The sizing is off, it is way too large compared to the item description about the sizing. Also, I wrote the name and bride so that they could do the initials lettering but I was disappointed when the robe came in completely wrong. They wrote out her name and put bride in really small writing. I know that mistakes can easily be made, especially with customizations so I reached out to see if they can fix this, since this is a gift and the bride will be married in less than two weeks. They were short and rude and offered me no solutions. Don’t recommend, be careful when customizing.",Negative

Item not as promised This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another. It was very uneven. I was looking for navy blue and light blue which was shown in the picture and it came out as dark blue and purple which made it look a little girly for a boy’s room. The product was expensive plus shipping was not just worth my money.,Negative
Name Plate too little The name plate area was much smaller than the original photo displayed.  I couldn't even easily read the name without a magnifying glass.<br />This is a result of not being able to actually see the product before purchasing.  I wouldn't have purchased this product.,Negative

"Extremely overpriced! Come on.  Look at it.  Seriously, take your time and observe it.  Scroll through each picture and slowly review each one.  And like me, you will realize this thing is basically a few simple cuts of plywood that have been stained and assembled using the cheapest legs you can purchase from your local hardware store.  Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!",Negative

Not very happy with product Took 1 hour to stick it to my wall using a credit card. Very small I ordered the 18x12 thinking that atleast the race track would be big enough for my son's hotwheels to drive on but it's smaller then a hotwheel. I have spent $28 on a big Forrest decal that covers my entire  wall for a master bedroom then I spend $25.88 on this decal that took more time to get on the wall and it's small. Not worth the money and time to me and my son only played on it a total of one minute which I expected but it's just frustrating how hard it was to stick to my very flat wall that has litterally no waves or anything like that to prevent it from sticking. The look is aesthetically pleasing but other then that it's not really something I'm happy with throwing $25.88 at.,Negative
Not worth the price I bought these as a gift but they are not worth the price. The product and packaging feels very cheap.,Negative

Piercer not willing to put this ring in for me due to the way it was snipped on the end The problem I had with this product was no piercer was willing to put it in for me.

"Defective Products The products were cheaply made. The word family was broken. Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.",Negative

Cheap fabric and runs very small. Fabric was a very stiff cotton and ran very small. I am usually a women’s size 4 and I could not even get the shirt on. Small is more like a child’s size 10. If you return you need to pay for return shipping which at the cheapest may cost around $10. I would only buy if you are willing to lose money.,Negative

Got caught These were difficult to get in my daughters ears but I was pleased they didn’t fall out like others. However the earring was caught in her blanket & no she no longer can wear them.  Disappointed bc they were so cute,Negative
"thin wood The wood is too thin and fragile. When I opened the package the item was broken. The letter S was completely broken and the whole item was spray painted but did not had a top coat, causing the sign to smell like paint.",Negative
No powder puff comes with the powder Did not smell like lilac hardly at all,Negative
"Ants on soap I sent this soap to s relative and received a call from her about it. When she opened the package, ants were all over it. I told her to Toss it immediately. Do not make this purchase.",Negative
Not what I expected. I was hoping this would be more substantial. I'm sorry I don't have better things to say about this.,Negative
NEVER AGAIN! Terrible. They put the name of the recipient in green letters behind light blue water background and you could not see his name at all. It was not a good sign at all. I had to go over it with black magic marker so that we could at least see the name of the recipient. I couldn’t believe that they even sent that to me knowing that there was no way that they saw the recipients name. It was that bad!!! NEVER AGAIN!,Negative
Pricey Definitely not worth the price for what I received.  Disappointed.,Negative
Tarnished and looks cheap The seller did replace with the same thing but it looks the same. Not giftable,Negative
Not real Jade It's not real jade.. And it pissed me off that its advertised as white jade and it's not even close.. Its some kind of glass.. Faus advertisement is illegal last time I checked.,Negative
Cute but not sturdy I liked the personalization and it arrived with a cute purple organza bag but the necklace broke within 3 days of my daughter wearing it. I definitely think it should of lasted longer.,Negative
Cheap Junk! THIS looks great in the misleading pic on Amazon.  In person; looks like something out of a bubblegum machine.  Not worth $46.  Maybe $15 and that's pushing it.  Cheap monogram lettering quality too.  I'll give it to my 16 y/o.  Perhaps she'll like it.,Negative
Color will fade and run Washed on cold once it arrived and the colors ran. The design is now faded and it white. Very disappointed. Also sizing is huge.,Negative
Don't  buy To small and just a sharp metal piece that isn't like a real ear ring,Negative
Not wroth it So I thought these was pictures ready to hand on the wall. Not real pictures as if I took them and went and got. Them printed out now I have to do and find frams for these... my god I just wanted to hang them in my bath room now I have to send more money,Negative

"Not happy with quality or size This product is poorly manufactured.  The backing material is stickier than the actual decal.  I had a problem on every single tree, mostly the backing pulling the decal off the wall.  By the time i was done with the last tree, i noticed the 1st tree i put on was begining to peel off.  Not happy at all",Negative
Colors fade Loved this sign at first. However the colors do fade as other reviewers have indicated. The white parts have red outlines from where the black faded or bled over.<br /><br />We do not have this hanging near a window or direct sunlight. Very disappointed in the quickly fading quality of this product.,Negative
Don’t buy It’s not worth buying it broke as soon as I tried putting it on my ankle,Negative
Not so impressive Seems flimsy. Sharp edges.  Hard to hang without showing the nail.  Probably should have gotten a larger one- the small size isn’t exciting enough to fill up even a small space,Negative

"VERY rustic Very rough representation of photo in item’s description. Little metal flakes falling off at the slightest touch. Expected more of a finished product, even when listed as “rustic”. Won’t be giving as a gift as expected.",Negative
Awful necklace tarnished after wearing twice This necklace tarnished after wearing a few times. It shouldn’t have done that as it claims to be sterling silver.,Negative
"Peeled off after wearing once The product looked great when it arrived, fit as expected and was really cute! Unfortunately after only wearing it once, all of the lettering in “Miss” peeled off.",Negative
"Not worth it! They are beautifully crafted but there tiny as hell..not worth money, to expensive",Negative
Broken Broke super quickly. It was gorgeous but sadly broke.,Negative
"Nice bracelets except one of them came frayed/broken I like the bracelets but I feel ripped off bc I won’t be able to wear one of them bc I was sent one that was already frayed / defective. I opened it up, expanded the bracelet and found that the main rope is going to break if I try to put it on. Don’t know if that’s bc of bad quality rope, poor quality checking or just bad luck.",Negative
Not what I purchased  ,Negative
HORRIBLE DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY DO NOT TRUST THEIR PRODUCTS they are poorly made and although they approved my return its at my own cost which cost more than the item I purchased!!! As they know most will not pay the cost because it just isn’t worth it. I RATHER THROW IT AWAY BUT WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY IN THE FUTURE. IF I COULD GIVE THEM A MINUS RATING I WOULD!!!!,Negative
"As you see in photo necklace broke off right where attached. Im 66 and never had a piece come apart I am going to send this necklace back to you so you can see how it broke off and you tell me whether it was worth $32 for me to keep this broken necklace after having it two months I really liked it I liked the jade piece on it, but it is very saddening to me that you can sell something that would snap off the way this did For no reason and no way did I not abuse this when I took it off, I hung it up",Negative
"Too small for the U.S dollor I had to return it.  It's great quality, however the picket is too small for the u.s dollar unless it's folded in half.  With means if you carry more than like one bill it's too thick to fit anywhere. Once I put a little cash my ID and a credit card in it would beraly close, glad they have a decent return policy...",Negative
Junk!!! NOT stainless….NOT safe or healthy.  Cheap junk.  I got an infection after 24 hours.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!,Negative
Very Disappointed. The packaging was awful!!!!<br />When I opened the package powder went EVERYWHERE!!!!!!<br />The powder is also disappointing. Not really a med or strong honeysuckle scent.  No puff to apply.<br />Will not be reordering!!!<br />Lucky I don’t sent it back!!!,Negative
It was okay Extremely small. Potential choking hazard to smaller children.,Negative
"Dried out in 6 days It was fun to play with, and a neat science toy. Friday night everything was fine. I moved the magnets away from the ferrofluid and put the bottle on a shelf. The next day all the ferrofluid had hardened into this weird shape. Sad that it cost $30 and didn't last long.",Negative
Didn’t look like the name I ordered. I needed to use this for my husband man cave.. but when I received the order it didn’t look like his name Ike.. so I can’t use it.. the first letter is off. The craftsmanship was nice but other than that I wasn’t too happy.,Negative
"Doesn't look like 14k, looks fake or 10k, magnet stuck The necklace stuck to a magnet, it doesnt even look gold, looks silver and painted gold. Its fake or I was scammed and they gave me 10k. Not happy will return.",Negative
"Creased in shipping Poster itself is nice, glossy and rich colors.  They didn’t ship it in a tube though and instead used a small, long box, which did not hold its shape and resulted in the poster that had been rolled up inside to have creases throughout.  Very disappointed in what otherwise was a great product to have been ruined because the seller failed to properly package it.",Negative
Did not last Lasted 4 months.,Negative
Pictures the pictures are very small. I was looking for something much bigger to place on my wall.,Negative

Christmas gift I wanted. Drive Safe Dee Dee and on back Love Garrett,Negative
I’d expect to pay 10.00 for this in a store They won’t let you return this due to a custom order. Which is you choose the cord. Seriously!! It’s a cord. The pendant is so light it doesn’t even hold the cord down. A complete waste of money. And I never give bad reviews.,Negative
Lasting product Less than two months and already faded,Negative
"The way it was shipped ruined it The letters are very cute and this would be perfect if the vinyl wasn’t wrapped around itself in a circle when it was shipped. The clear layer was detached partly from the letters and base layer. I tried putting it under something heavy for a few days hoping it would flatten it and make it stick to the letters but no luck. We had to cut each letter, press the clear layer onto it and quickly do the transfer. Very disappointed",Negative
"Writing too small and not clear, I thought there ... Writing too small and not clear, I thought there was going to be real string on it for the lights. I would not buy this again, It is not worth $18.95",Negative

"Doesn't stick to ALL types of Walls Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.",Negative
"Only 1 sticker?? Nice, but not worth the price paid. I have ordered other stickers for about the same price and received several pieces. I was quite shocked when I only received 1 sticker for the price paid. I should have read more in detail.",Negative
Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much ... I have to admit that I’m NOT impressed. Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.,Negative
Meh. Nice size but the middle stone is not at all vibrant in color. It looks more like a dull and dismal stone that it not at all transparent. Extremely disappointed.,Negative

"Colors are not bright. I bought three of these as friendship bracelets for myself and 2 friends going on a girl's Caribbean trip. The colors were muted. Boring.  I had spent time picking from one color to another, but to me they all looked the same when they were opened  and were darker earth tones.  I was disappointed.",Negative
Major Typo on All Typed Art :( Classic but with a major mistake. Typo with you and your. :(,Negative
"Defective product - seller says ""make  it work"". I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6"" tall and the other 5"" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75"" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to ""make it work"" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.",Negative
"Pretty but not what I expected Absolutely love the dress, the only reason for a low star rating wi ordered a flower ring like the picture and I received a dream catcher picture on the dress.

"Iaco Iusday This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.  Will return.",Negative

Deceiving The streets have no names. Why would I buy and keep a map like that?,Negative
Very sharp The pendant has very sharp edges,Negative
Terrible Quality Engraving The engraving is of embarrassingly terrible quality -- the p is centered above the rest of the letters and looks like an upside down b. This was supposed to be a gift to my girlfriend for Valentine's day but I would be embarrassed to give this to her if I made it myself. I have to rush order something else.,Negative

The bottom half of the case is alright, but the top lid immediately comes off on its own. I tried to show this in the video, and as you can see, the back/top flat is too large and slides right off. Just submitted for a return or refund. Sorry if the video is a little shaky. I am just a bit annoyed because I was really excited and relied on the other positive reviews.",Negative

It was big I have a little neck but this was pretty huge and cheaply made. Not really worth the money,Negative
Very disappointed I couldn’t believe how tiny the stones were in these earrings. Much smaller than they looked in the picture. I wouldn’t have ordered them if I’d know how itsy tiny they were. Disappointed.,Negative
"Painted Glass or plastic - the description is a play on words. The description calls out a gemstone -  - what i got was painted glass beads where the paint is coming off on my skin within 1 hour of putting it on.  I didn't pay much for it, but at the very least I  expected something other than painted glass or plastic beads.",Negative
"Very small These are nicely made and the thickness is good.  However, they are VERY SMALL.  I can't imagine they would fit a man's face.  My face is not large at all and they were too narrow, even with the ear loops out as far as possible.",Negative

Very slow shipping Nice wrapping paper took over a week to get to me,Negative
Just say-in The seller did not state that the image is not in the center of the towel. It is near the left edge of the towel. This makes it difficult to hang as a decorative towels to hang in the bathroom or on the oven. I am disappointed.-,Negative

Color  variation Disappointed so thin. Feels like plastic. Ordered Verde so I expected it to be Verde but it came copper. I assume it will  patina / oxidize overtime ????  Keeping it because it's cool/beautiful  and will be beautiful in the guest bath which doubles as a mudroom... yeah imagine that combo. It's an old house in the country that sits on the Rogue River in Oregon.  Fingers crossed it turns in time,Negative
Not what I expected. My name was written so plainly rather than cursive. Looks like it was done with a sharpie. The top flap doesn’t secure properly. It keeps slipping off when I open the case.,Negative
NO NO,Negative
"Color faded quickly I was initially impressed with the design. We kept it in storage in a dark, cool area. Checked on it to put it in our suitcase a couple months later and all the color, especially the black was faded with an ugly purplish/red color.

"THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE! DO NOT BUY! There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring ""no effort"" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't ""motivating"", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.",Negative

Skip this- there are MANY better options available. Not comfortable to wear at all. There are SEVERAL better options for fake rings available on Amazon. Definitely skip this one. The design makes it impossible to fit correctly not to mention extremely uncomfortable. You're better off getting a permanent piercing or trying a different type of fake or temporary ring. this is just a plain ring that is damn near impossible to put on correctly and extremely uncomfortable.,Negative
"Product was Severely Damaged As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open. The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY!

Read description closely If there was a less than one star option i would have went with that. The product description says this is not very thick at all. The images would lead you to believe this is three dimensional....... it is not..... just a cheap one dimensional paper doll. I would recommend you pay special attn to the description and n I t trust the images. I would return it but it's not worth the time or effort.  Looks like they got me on this one.,Negative
"Poor Quality Dislike that I have to take of the pendant in order to open the pendant.<br />Dislike the poor quality of the metal.

The material also does not appear to be stained or protected from weather and water.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller, and unfortunately no resolution was provided by seller. There is also no refund/exchange protection for this item via Amazon. Be prepared to have no options or protection, if the item you receive does not match the photos listed.",Negative

literally the smallest things you've ever seen When these arrived in the mail my sister legitimately thought I bought earrings made for a doll. They're little more than a piece of wire in a circle.

Not to my liking Having a hard time finding good smelling melts,Negative

Save your money and buy one that’s better made and better support.",Negative

I didn’t want to give it a star, but I couldn’t submit this unless I did. -1 star!",Negative
"DONT BUY! I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!",Negative
Cheap Unraveled within a couple of weeks,Negative
Great quality stone but ring itself will turn colors quickly. I was highly satisfied with with stone itself. The band thickness is okay but turned my finger colors within a couple days wear. I avoided washing hands and lotion while wearing. This was not great value product. I've bought cheaper rings that didn't turn.,Negative
Too much money for this piece of paper! Don’t buy this or you will be disappointed! Nothing but cardboard paper that needs double sided tape to put in wall. Not very happy with this,Negative
"quality is non-existent I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.",Negative
They are small!!! Overpriced ! The pumpkins are good quality but they are small size. They are not big at all. Considering the overprice.....it is not worth it!,Negative

Not What I Expected Very cute but buyer beware this is just a printed sign on thin paper. You will have to frame this.,Negative
"Cheap material It didn’t last 30 seconds. I’ve ordered other earrings from this company and I’ve been much more pleased. The leaf fell off within 30 seconds of trying to put it in and the earring itself is just very cheaply made, losing shape with the slightest movement. I’ve had plenty of luck with infinity hoops before but this was just a no from me. Unfortunately, I have to rate it one star.",Negative

Not for the long haul Unfortunately they lasted just a week,Negative
Scent This is reasonably looking sign that conveys the message needed but the chemical scent that the sign has it overtly over powering to say the very least. It’s really bad and will make anything stored next to it smell the same.. 😬,Negative

"These are too small for my ear. I think ... These are too small for my ear. I think that it is not actually 8mm. The clasp is ridiculously hard to put on, and it took 3 people and an hour to get these on. Once on, they are too small and hug my ear tightly without moving. These are also extremely bendable. If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them. Also, the material made my ears react to them and I have never has this problem before",Negative

"Letters Peeling Off The shirts were amazing! It looks just like the pucture. They were soft and run true to size. The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.",Negative

Package is supposed to include 3 pieces but only come with 2! The quality of the gemstone is not the issue. The issue is false description when the package states there are 3 pieces of opal instead only come with 2 pieces.,Negative
Weak scent Didn’t really smell like anything :(,Negative
Not worth the price! I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.,Negative

Pretty....useless Doesn't seem to want to stay on.,Negative
Engraving very hard to see against the rose gold. The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name. I wish the engraving came in a different color or at least a little thicker. Did not meet my expectations like the photos,Negative

Don’t like the packaging I like the product. I only used it maybe 3x because I had a hard time opening it because it was closed way too tight.  The last time I used it I dropped it on the floor and made a big mess. You may wanna think about repackaging it. ☹️,Negative

"Disappointed Disney fan This shirt is super soft but the color is horrible and the fit is strange- the neck is very high cut, circling the base of the neck rather than around the bottom like a typical round neck tee. The color is mustard yellow- a bright orange/yellow that is displeasing to the eye. I read the other reviews before purchasing and knew it would be bright- but not the mustard tone. I’m really disappointed and don’t plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. I ordered Belle Mickey ears to match and the colors are nothing alike.",Negative

It has a coconut derivative in it. Don’t bother if allergic to coconut. It has a coconut derivative in it that’s not listed in this ad for the item: cetearyl alcohol. I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.,Negative

"Started out great, then went downhill I got these and they were going to go perfect in my son's spiderman room. I even waited a little bit to put them up because I had painted my sons room about a month prior and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause gas bubbles. So about another 3-4 weeks later I applied them. The application process was pretty straightforward and easy. They looked great on the wall. Then roughly 24hrs later, they started peeling off the wall! I tried to use the squeegee to reapply it, basically lifting the whole decal off the wall, then it started ripping as I was trying to reapply it. No matter how slow, or carefully I tried, each decal would rip in about 6+ spots. Now, 1/2 to 3/4 of each decal actually sticks to the wall and most of the bottoms are peeling off (and won't stick no matter how many times I try to get it to) and have numerous rips. Not what I was expecting at all, considering all the good reviews. Pretty disappointed, especially since these weren't cheap.<br /><br />Edit: added pictures. 1st picture showing all buildings is right after 1st time applying. Following pictures are about 24 hours later, peeling, and when gently trying to reapply they started ripping.",Negative
"One was perfect, one was not and got worse We ordered 2 of these.  One came perfect, the other one showed up in 2 separate orders wells later and it didn’t have holes to put the legs into and after 2 months it developed a huge crack where the boards separated.  We don’t use it often so we didn’t notice, and now it’s too late to replace or return according to the seller.",Negative
"Terrible resolution. Don't waste your money. Exactly as another reviewer said.  Looks like someone (anyone) just pulled a jpg and stretched it to print on card stock.<br /><br />This doesn't even count as a photo or a ""print"".<br /><br />You could do the same thing for less than $1 by sending a internet jpg to Walmart to print.  Wasteful and feels very dishonest.",Negative
Very small Cute but not worth the price,Negative
Low quality So thin you can see thru it. This would be better for ladies fashion then anything tactical. Ends where ready to split and not tied as a traditional one would be. Have used these in dessert and snow and would only use this to blow my nose.,Negative

"Not as pictured- gold necklace has no silver and doesn’t match The chain is a very yellow gold and has no silver accents like the description states.

Packaging was nice, but going back.",Negative
"Not worth the time or the money So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one. Very disappointed not even with 1 star.",Negative
"Save yourself the frustration Never ordering from this seller again. One of the trigger pieces is too big for the slot on the blaster and no amount of sanding could fix it.

Picture on left is what I was expecting the stamped letters to look like. Picture on the right is what they actually look like. You can barely see it! The letters do not take up the whole space as the pictures would lead you to believe. Nor are the letters bold enough to be legible. Oh but according to the seller, they say all of this in the description: “letters so small you can only see them up close yourself”",Negative
"Not printed on an actual dictionary page It's ok, I guess. I purchased another dictionary art print from another seller that is actually printed on a genuine vintage dictionary page. This one is not. It is a COPY of a print done on a dictionary page and printed on photo paper. The lack of authenticity is a disappointment. Just not the same.",Negative

"Faulty!! I originally bought this for my friend as a birthday gift, as we surprised him with a night out to the Lizzo concert. I was so excited, as I felt this would be a great way to remember the night.<br /><br />WRONG! The design was faulty, and the hole was too close to the top, so would not be able to hang beautifully from anything.<br /><br />After chatting with an Amazon rep, they shipped a replacement. I was expecting this to work, but nope! The second replacement had the same issue: the hole was ripped through the top, unable to hang from anything.<br /><br />Yet again, I chatted with a representative who SWORE this third time would be the charm. In case you couldn’t guess by the photo attached, the third had the same issue with the broken through hole.<br /><br />I’m SO disappointed.",Negative
"I should have done more research At the end of the day, it is probably my fault I am not happy with the results.  The lettering I received was not what was pictured and even though I ordered the large font it looks tiny and “delicate” on my mailbox.  I can’t read it from the car as I approach the house.  The ordering process was not clear and there isn’t a confirmation of size/color after you place the order.  In the description they offer to send you a mock up of some sort but I didn’t see that until after the product arrived.  If what you are looking for is what is pictured, be sure to contact the seller before it ships no matter what.  Otherwise you have no idea what you are getting.",Negative

"Disappointed I received this necklace as a graduation gift from my best friend. Immediately I loved it! Its a super cute necklace and came packaged nicely. I have only wore my necklace for 3 days now, and the plating is flaking and peeling off. There is hardly any on the back and the sides, and its working towards the front. I am very disappointed that this has happened so soon after very minimal wear.",Negative
You get what you pay for....... I guess This would have been cute had it not been for the smudged ink and uneven pattern. I tried to fold it to make it even over my bed (king size) but as you can see in the photo it's uneven at the bottom.  Makes no sense to return. It will be replaced with a better quality tapestry.,Negative

"Absolutely beautiful!! This is the second ring I've bought from this seller.  I now have both of Claire's wedding bands from the show Outlander and I love them both 💜  They are both very well crafted and worth every penny.<br />UPDATE 02\17\21: I have to remove some stars from this ring, after really looking at it, this was not made by hand (as in NOT well crafted) at all, it must've been stamped by a machine because 2 out of the 3 pineapples aren't fully etched in nor are the others which I believe to be a leaf and feather maybe??  Really hard to tell.  I still wear it but wouldn't pay this much if I had seen it in person.  The other one, while not really looking like Claire's ring, is still very pretty.",Negative
"Paper Thin, Very Fragile, Needs To Be Heavier To Match Cord I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with.

"Cool design, horrible execution, abnormal sizing The design would be so cool if you could actually see it. The black printing is so close to the color of the gray shirt that someone will have to be right up on your chest to see what it is. Also, its either an irregular cut shirt or one of those reject ones you buy from the discount stores because it is way wider and shorter than a typical size large.",Negative

"Pretty but not all there I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.",Negative
"Caveat Emptor - Shoddy Product This is an extremely shoddy product.  It's as if the seller bought a do-it-yourself magnet kit, proceeded to cut pictures from an old promotional pamphlet and put together a ""finished"" product.

"Knob is not defined enough, but packaging was amazing. First of all, this came all the way from Turkey. The detail given to packaging and shipping, I would give 10 stars if I could.<br />The reason for 4 stars:  the knob to hold and pull the plate Feom needed to be a little bigger for gripping. I have used these in the past, but this one is more difficult to maneuver, especially hot.  It is also isnt glazed as others, so this one will retain flavors when cleaned.<br />The design otherwise is very pretty.<br />Update:  after cooking with them, we discovered that it ruined the taste of the food.  I think the solution is they need to glazed.",Negative

Broken garbage. DO NOT BUY This plate is extremely disappointing. I bought this for my mom who is a HUGE star wars fan. The picture is extremely misleading.

Stem is too short Beautiful nosering and reasonable shipping time. Two-star rating only because the stem of the nosering is way too short and doesn't poke all the way through the piercing. Sadly I'm unable to wear it.,Negative
"Be prepared for the smell. Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.",Negative

Not for me It was too small for my piercing,Negative

"Poor quality leather I purchased this bag a couple of weeks ago and first I was shipped the wrong color, a replacement was shipped out only after I had to send pictures of the wrong colored bag.  The correct color arrived and I loved it until about a week into use.  The leather on the handles started to flake off, when I contracted the maker, they stated that this was vintage leather and this was common and that I could send it back to be fixed, keep in mind I have only had the bag 2 weeks!  The logo on the bag has perfect leather(shocking)!  I love supporting small business but this bag is sadly not worth the money, the design and size are great but the quality is poor.",Negative

It didn't look like an ""F"" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the ""F"" letter!!

Not a real leather. Sorely disappointed! This just a leather match case. Basically multiple layers of ground up leather base synthetics and glue.

Too Small I already have very small wrist. I can wear kid size bracelets and even this looked too thin and small on me. The name engraved on it is so tiny!! Not even in proportion. Good to wear in a set and maybe a small msg just for you but not at all what I was expecting,Negative

"Doesn't fit!! This thing has this weird inner rubber gasket. It's so incredibly tight, that when you try to squeeze and jam the airpods in, the inner seal thing snags due to friction and drags it with it. Oh, and it's SO TIGHT you have to cut it off; it will not come out at all.<br /><br />Pretty convenient to say you can't do returns on personalized products when they don't fit and are crap. Easy way to scam and get rid of poorly made merchandise.",Negative

I hope you can cut a straight line. These are slightly bigger than 11x14 and will not fit in a frame unless you cut them down. Can you cut a straight line? Me either. Disappointing.,Negative
"Beautiful but sterling silver? The earrings caused an allergic reaction in my ears after wearing for 3 days. The earrings even tarnished in 3 days. After cleaning the pair (because I love the design and fit!) one earring remains ""pitted"". See picture. I bought these during the COVID lockdown but will wait until stores re-open to purchase personal items such as earrings. Expensive lesson learned.",Negative
"Not happy with this product Stone fell out the third day, very disappointed",Negative
"Fun idea, wasted eight bucks. Not sticky enough so peels at various points (on the plus side, it's easy to remove). Didn't quite fit Quest so first had to be trimmed and it just doesn't lay right on non-flat headset surface. I'll probably put two small googly eyes on instead (each with a small enough surface area to be<br />on a more or less flat part of the device).",Negative
"The nose ring delivered to you is not at all the nose ring presented on the sellers page. Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!",Negative

Not potent at all Waited 3 weeks to get this product was super excited. Because let's face it who doesn't want their house to smell like fruity pebbles?? Got it put it in my burner and waited for my house to smell amazing... I could only smell it when I got right over top of my burner. Super disappointed...Kroger wax melts are cheeper and smell better,Negative
Ring turned green It was beautiful but I wore it for 8 hours and it turned my finger green so not worth it to me,Negative
Great idea.  Poor execution. Shoes fit properly but the printing was stretched horizontally.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and asked for corrected sneakers but was just given the opportunity to return.  No option to get what I ordered....PLUS I had to pay shipping to return it.,Negative
"12 month shirt is bigger than the 18 month The print is cute. I ordered these for my identical twin boys that will be turning 2 soon. Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....",Negative

Colors NOT as pictured I ordered 21 LEFT and 33 RIGHT. They are not similar to the color guide image that she has. I was very disappointed. I am not at all a pink/purple kind of person and the 21 is definitely not blue as her image portrays. The 33 is not nearly as vibrant as her image. It’s more of a light lime shade. I contacted the seller and she basically said this is how it is. Very disappointing.,Negative
"Rusted out only after 2 months of use I bought this as a gift for someone and kept good care of it in its box for a few months. After it was given, the ring started to show signs of heavy damage after only a few weeks, unlike the rest of the rings she wore. Definitely wouldn’t recommend",Negative

Is very small By looking at the the description it says a 8 by 10 and as you see it’s not even a 5 by 7 not worth the money,Negative
"Cheap! Don't waste your time or money. I immediately return item when I open it and seen these were cheaply, made with a enormous price......",Negative

"Cheap Extremely disappointing. Dough stuck (even with flour dusting), impressions were inferior, and the plastic parts warped in the top rack of my Bosch no-heating-element-dishwasher. One-time use; no desire to replace. A waste of money.",Negative
Poor quality worse customer service This decal would not peel away from the paper.  I tried is several spots and the paper came with it.  The directions were for a 3 price produce.  Mine was two piece.  The directions referenced spraying the decal with soapy water and I did so.  Decal still would not come off the paper.  Contacted seller and they were not helpful and generally insulting and rude.  If you have an issue they won’t help you or replace the product.  Try a different seller,Negative

"Too much plastic wrapping!! The actual conditioner bar is ok. Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste. But this thing was wrapped in 3! Layers of plastic in addition to the amazon packaging. The metal tin was in a plastic bag. Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!",Negative

"Other superior items available... These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.",Negative

They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.",Negative
No shine I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.,Negative
Misunderstood This is just a piece of paper. Had to frame it like a picture.<br /><br />Thought this was wood or synthetic.,Negative

"Important  message, poor construction. I liked the printed sign itself. The fact it is printed on thin, cheap cardboard is a minus. The stand that you are to insert or tap to display will not withstand moisture, wind for long so I can't  display until the day of. I tend to average 150 tweeters on Halloween  and am very concerned with this virus that kids, families, grandparents or us neighbors will be super spreaders of this virus. I appreciate the message of this sign and hope and pray we won't  need it ever again!",Negative

Got broken Got broken,Negative
Not worth it The colors were no where near as vibrant as it shows in the photo. For the price I was really disappointed and felt like I could have made this print myself.,Negative
Not a good look in a bracelet This is a nice looking bracelet. The problem with it is that it is perfectly round and has a lot of room between the bracelet and the arm. It looks ridiculous when your arm is resting on something because the bracelet is pushed up from underneath which leaves the part on top of the wrist standing way up above the wrist. I don't like wearing it at all and neither does my niece. I do not recommend this bracelet.,Negative
Terrible. Don’t Buy. These look like they were generated from a home computer printer. The words and date are tiny and illegible.,Negative
Two Stars Incorrect spelling.,Negative
"Eh I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.",Negative
Very low quality. We returned it because this looked ... Very low quality.  We returned it because this looked cheesy.,Negative
feels okay if there is wind makes me sweat more than other mask but if there is wind blowing then it feels good,Negative
Broke in less than 4 months I would have given a great review.  The earrings are stylish and light. When I took them out to wear them yesterday the wood broke right around the post. Apparently the quality is not very good if they are going to break within 4 months. I am not hard on earrings and have earrings that I have owned 20+ years. Do not reccomend buying these,Negative
"Order at your own risk.... I only gave it 1 star because I had to. For approx. $50.00 this ""metal"" bracelet can break into any second while wearing it.  I will be returning it.

Damaged Arrived late and damaged,Negative
"Disappointed 😞 Not what I expected.  Not worth the price.  Unable to use this item.  Disappointed with this purchase.  I should have drawn this and printed it on my own photo paper for a lot less money.  Could have purchased 2 packs of photo printer paper for this price.  I guess if you really want to spend more money matting and framing these they would be alright, but it's not worth it to me - I'll probably just use them in a scrap book or something.",Negative

Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, ""We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued."" Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting.

Gold foil was fading off before I even took it out of the bag! Was pretty disappointed with the quality. The gold lettering was already rubbed off on part of the keychain when I received it.

"Be VERY careful what font you pick! I love the shiny brass of the tag since so many tags are all silver which made me happy to find a ""gold"" one. HOWEVER, I WISH the seller would include the entire alphabet in each font (upper and lower case) so that we'd be able to pick the right font when spending so much money on a specially made tag.<br /><br />Showing us examples of the fonts with 3 letter names like Max or even a longer name like Bella however those examples don't help any of us with dogs that have longer/different names or help us decide if we want the tag in all uppercase or a mix.<br /><br />I wish that the seller would either show us the entire alphabet of fonts OR make it so we'd get an actual previews of what the tag would look like in each font BEFORE ordering that way we get exactly what we want especially for these tags that cost pretty much the same as the ones in the pet stores do that actually show you exactly what you're getting.<br /><br />I would have never ordered this tag in this font if they would have shown the different fonts completely and clearly.

If you look at the description closely, it does say 8x10, but I wish that there was an option to select specific size and corresponding price at check out so it would have been more obvious what size this was. Since I was searching for posters, I didn’t expect something this size to be described as a poster, but I guess its a lesson to check the details of an item very closely before you order.",Negative

I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are.

"Very Disappointed In Size I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.",Negative
"Someone definitely wasn’t paying attention when they engraved what I ordered. I’m definitely going to be returning this.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks and feels super cheap, like $10 cheap. I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for.

"Not worth the price! I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.",Negative

Very obvious misrepresentation of what you pay for, which is also quite pricey for what you get....if it was the size advertised I would consider it a good buy, but being 2"" shorter than shown I wouldn't waste your money.",Negative

Also, the nail holes are visible ALL OVER the table - they didn't even attempt to cover or paint over them, so it looks very poorly put together.  After I received it, I went back and looked at the pictures online and those also showed all of the nail holes. I wish I had looked more closely at the pictures and reviews before buying  ALOT of money for something so poorly put together.  Will not buy from this seller again.  I'm afraid I'm stuck with it after reading other reviews.",Negative

I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.

"Tabs for hanging medals are razor sharp!!! For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted.

The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product.

The day before the wedding, we took it out of the packaging to have it ready for the wedding cake and the heart that hangs from the fishing pole had broken off at the fishing pole. We had kept it in the packaging that it had been shipped in and were gentle with it. It's absolutely adorable, but the material is not the best quality and is very fragile and frankly flimsy!

The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.",Negative

"I REALLY wanted to like this shirt! I am a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan, so I was very excited to see this shirt.  I bought it immediately. My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!",Negative
Will break Breaks after first use,Negative
"Don't waste your money. 1 star is being generous. I would give this product zero stars if possible.  Not only does it seem to be poorly 3d printed, but its overall junk. The plungers weren't even finished properly.<br /><br />Top that off with having to pay to return an unfinished product is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Update:  getting my refund was a nightmare too.  That was mostly Amazon's fault.",Negative

"Beautiful but not how I order it. Overall this is a beautiful necklace,  but whoever did the work kinda did there own thing.  They did not use the font I choose and they did it in caps lock, which I purposely type out everything in lower case. It also was smaller than I was expecting. It’s a gift for my best friend, so I’m sure she will like it either way, but I was disappointed and bummed that it wasn’t how I ordered it.",Negative
Size of a quarter.  Thrown away. Don't buy!  Cheap and too small!  The size of quarters and only one sided.  These are a perfect example of only-for-sale on the internet because NO ONE would buy them in person.  Too crappy to even go through the process of returning- just straight to the trash.,Negative
Cute but doesn't stick very well! Maybe they need to invest in better laminate. Two of the 7 letters keep falling which pulls on the additional attached letters & I have to smooth them back out every couple days when I go in my daughter's room.,Negative
"Not so great Not sure what I was expecting here, but as this year has taught all of us; Expect the unexpected. The quality is fairly poor and not even centered on what appears to be foam board. Great idea but bot so great delivery.",Negative
Horrible horrible smell Made the mistake of unpackaging in the car- both the driver & I immediately had to unroll our windows. The smell was super toxic. If that wasn’t enough to make me return the over all quality of product was lack luster- spotty dye on the leather (tbh I didn’t even bother to unsnap- just returned ASAP).,Negative
Came to us ripped. Came ripped at bottom.,Negative

Holy strong These shower steamers work as they should but are so very strong it made my headache worse. I will probably try to break them and see if I can use just a tiny amount…,Negative
Had high hopes. This product is very very nice looking. However I really expected more than a copy and paste type print.<br />I gave the artist and song title.<br />The print is obviously a cut and paste.<br />Just some common sense punctuation would be great.<br />Pretty much ruins it for us.,Negative

Cheap Cheap material that broke after a few impressions.,Negative
Cheap product. They claim 3oz of leather and you end up getting... 4.8 grams. Sent me a thin strip of paper scrap leather with laser cuts in it claiming it is premium leather and will last a long time... The laser etching alone was too deep for how thin the strap was. The strap is so thin that you cannot wear it with a watch and look normal. I will post pictures. When I requested a return the seller says I have to pay for shipping. I haven't used this thing and I am having to pay 10% to return this defective item? It is roughly half the thickness shown in the pictures. Maybe even less. They claim 3oz of leather and you end up getting... 4.8 grams. I cannot even make this up. This is so clearly a rip off.,Negative

Disappointed to say the least. The paint was not dry when placed inside the cardboard casing. It was a destroyed mess. This is (or was) the guest book for my wedding which is in 2 weeks.

Mech is not so much I admit when grandson put this on list… 8x10 didn’t ring thru as a “poster”. Just type font on fair 8x10 card stock paper. Nothing special… just a nice quote from Lin Manuel Miranda. I supposed He could have made it himself… as long as added quotes and he gave author credit! He was disappointed it wasn’t larger.  Buyer beware. Look at the size,Negative
"Wanted to love it but... I've always wanted a world map with pins. This one is beautiful, but there are some things I'd caution buyers about.  Some of the pieces are not very well made. For instance, once I'd put the pin in the UK piece, it broke :(  Next, it's not very easy to assemble, especially on the floor. And once you put it on the wall, forget about trying to get it off again to make any adjustments...the pieces will break if you try to remove them from the wall. Also, double check your flags....some flags were wrong on mine (such as Peru) and some flags were in the wrong place (for me, the Saudi Arabia flag was in the place of Russia's flag). Google ALL flags before pinning them on your wall if you aren't 100% confident that you know the country's flag. I won't be returning mine because, as I said, it's difficult to remove it from the wall and I paid a lot of money for it...easier to just leave it as it is at this point.",Negative

"Not worth the price I purchased this as a gift and never opened the package because the box was nicely sealed in plastic. When my niece opened it on Christmas Day I was disappointed in the quality.

Worst Men Bracelet Product was nothing like I expected. I will surely return it. This is the worst misrepresentation of an Amazon product I have encountered in my years of doing business with Amazon. This bracelet is a toy looking item ; nothing that represents a man's bracelet. If anything it was a baby bracelet.,Negative
"DO NOT BUY I normally don't write reviews, but I had to for this.<br />To start off, the packaging was terrible and my design came in a crumbled up mess.<br />When I removed the design I could tell that the corners were not all straight.<br />I now have a misshapened blob on my window.<br />Terrible, will never order again!",Negative

"Poor quality We received this giant kerplunk game as a gift for our daughter. The item is not as pictured, the wood is of poor quality and cracked - and not painted as the picture makes it appear.

Since I didn't buy the item myself, not sure if I can do anything about the purchase....",Negative
"Earthy scent...but not in a good way Maybe it's just my skin, but this did not have the sweet smell of Patchouli that I'm used to. I read in some of the reviews that it has a ""dirt"" smell but there were enough others that said it had a great smell.<br /><br />For me it smelled exactly like dirt. Not bad, if that makes sense, but definitely like dirt. I waited an hour or so to see if the scent would change, like some wrote. It didn't change, it just faded.",Negative
"Little and cloudy. In comparison against recently purchased orgone pyramids, this particular orgone pyramid quality is okay. It feels like this tiny  little guy was rushed.

No rocket on my print???? This picture was supposed to have a rocket on it. Mine came no rocket on the print. I discovered this after I got it framed.

It turned my husband finger green the first day. Made me so so sad. Looks great.  But it turned my husband finger green on day one. I do not recommend getting it. A ring at this price should not do that. Made me very very sad.,Negative
"Not sized properly! The fabric and monogram were fine but the apron was more than three inches narrower than it should have been  - less than 19” and supposed to be 22”. Additionally, the loop for the head was too small to make it over the child’s head! The second apron (not pictured) had a loop for a gigantic head and it was also narrower than they said it would be. Sent them both back and because it was faulty, Amazon credited my account. Would be afraid to order anything else from the company that made them!",Negative
Much smaller then said to be Great quality and amazing design however the measurements were 8x10 instead of 11x14,Negative
"Wording is way too light I purchased these in the rose gold color as a gift for my friends for our upcoming Vegas girls weekend. The wording is so light that in normal lighting you can’t even see whose cup is whose. Unfortunately I was not granted the opportunity to exchange it for ones with more contrast. The rose gold tone was a complete fail, and sadly the shop owner knew that as she stated in an email to me that the contrast is very light in the rose gold color.  It would have been nice knowing that before I spent that much money. Perhaps add that to the description. Lesson learned. Other than that they would be very cute in another color.",Negative
"meh 1.5 stars**UPDATE half a star I waited 30 days of shipping to get these two toe rings. These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!",Negative

Not what I thought The beads and bracelet are much smaller than I thought it would be.  The front keeps tangling. The beads are very tiny.  I was disappointed.,Negative
Underwhelmed This was very underwhelming. I was planning on buying a ton of these and am very glad I didn't. My fiancee`s last name was left off even though I requested it. Where some of the words are wood burned in they are not clear and difficult to read and the magnent on the back looks like it was just thrown on there (not in a good place to keep this on my fridge). This falls off of my fridge daily and i am very glad I did not buy these for my guests. Shipping also took over a month.,Negative
Didn't like it Not very moisturizing. More like a lip gloss that lasts less than 30 minutes.,Negative

Poor shipping method When the photo backdrop poster was taken out of the shipping box there were permanent creases in the poster. We followed the process for clueing the poster to foamboard. These ceases would not come out nor allow the poster to lay flat. The picture frame cutout shown in the attached photo will show these creases. We could not send the item back due to us using the backdrop for an event that weekend.,Negative
"Didn't hold up for 2 days of use I received this on Saturday and on Monday, I got it ready for work. Wallet, some pens, a small notebook and my phone. Wore it to work. Received nice comments on it. Repeated on Wednesday.<br /><br />Thursday morning, after approximately having used the bag very lightly for 16 total hours, most of that sitting on a desk, I go to leave the house with it and notice 3 puncture holes on the front. I panic at perceieved damage before realizing the buckle has come off. I look everywhere but can't find it. Depressed because a bag I like lacks quality, I file for a return.<br /><br />I get into the car and find the buckle on the floor. It was apparently held on by 3 very small prongs, which are now just slightly open, meaning it fell off from shifting and wasn't due to handling. I consider fixing it, but after re-examining the bag, there is no way to get up against the area where the prongs will go to reseat them from the inside.<br /><br />Then it makes me wonder what will happen if I put actual weight in the bag. Right now, it is super stiff, so even full, there wouldn't be much pressure exuded on the straps, but when it begins to loosen and become slack, those little tiny prongs aren't going to hold things safely closed.<br /><br />I was really wanting to like this bag. I have had it on my list for ages...blah.<br /><br />By the way, a 15.6"" laptop barely fits, and with a sleeve, there is basically no way to close the flap, hence my using it as a purse. On top of that, it is so stiff, and has very little lining, that one would probably not feel comfortable without a padded sleeve.",Negative
The good side was the sticky side The size was right but the good side had the sticky glue so unless you are putting it under glass it is useless<br />However I sent an email and was promptly refunded for the purchase,Negative
"Silver setting is not well fitted to the pear shaped stones I ordered these in late September as a holiday gift. They appeared fine in the clear plastic box. But when the earrings were taken out, I found the setting did not seem to fit the stones well. There are gaps between the stone and its silver setting in places, and one of the earrings has a small bend in the setting at about 10 o'clock as seen in the first photo.  I clicked on return, and then return to seller, but received an automatic notice that the return period has expired.  I was hoping to avoid holiday rush backlog by ordering early.  The stone is nice although heavier and the profile is higher than expected. But the silver setting is poorly formed, at least in my opinion.",Negative

Unfortunately they’re gorgeous and I just can’t let them go, but if I do regret buying them",Negative
"Awful product and the service was the worst. When I first received the Beanie, it did not look like it would keep you warm. As a matter of precaution, I hand-washed the Beanie to remove any harmful chemicals that might be coating this product. I put the Beanie on and it barely fit my head. Then when I wore it on a cold day, the wind went right through the loose weave on the Beanie. I'm severely disappointed with this product and would warn people about these issues.",Negative

"Do not buy this. Poor quality and  Returning it is impossible. This sweatshirt is absolute garbage.

Also.. if you DO decide To deal with returning it they charge a 20% fee.",Negative
Not worth the risk. Beautiful toy but the balls on the rope didn't seem particularly secure to me. The rope part just looked glued in. It's possible it would have been fine but it seemed like it could be a choking hazard especially since this is designed for very young babies.,Negative

Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the ... Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.,Negative
Volume & Power buttons disabled This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly. The seller insisted I bought the wrong case for my model phone... I did not. The case is not made properly. The only option I was given was to replace the case with the same case. No thanks.,Negative
Too small These are quite small rings. I wouldn't recommend for your nostril. I bought these because I have one nostril pierced and I'm toying with getting the other one pierced too. These are too small to reach to the same height on my nose that my other piercing sits at. They are very pliable but it doesn't work for me.,Negative
specifications great,Negative
Deceptive ad I received one soap cube. Not four cubes as was clearly advertised. This is very deceptive.,Negative
Buyer Beware This product was poor quality and not as described.,Negative
"Cheap iron on patch There are ZERO 4 or 5 star reviews, see for yourself click on one......From the looks of the mask on Amazon the squirrel appears to be sewn or embroidered in....it’s not. It’s a small squirrel iron on patch that’s been ironed onto a cheap flat fabric mask.  The squirrel s already coming unglued on the outside. Mask has no nose clip and no contoured chin. There is no filter pocket either. The mask is NOT adjustable at the ears so whatever the fit is it’s the best you’re going to get.... pretty sad really In my opinion it’s not worth the $14.95 total including shipping<br />Side note, there are no 5 or 4 star reviews, yet they show the 5 star at 55%....something isn’t right about that",Negative
Got when I was dating my ex..STILL A SUPER CUTE BRACELET! Lol Well I did like this bracelet and I still do..but I got this when I was dating my ex..ugh. Why does it have to be so cute! Lol I still recommend getting it if your special someone is a firefighter!,Negative

Good luck Not sure if you’re able to do this but you need a gender option because in the photos it’s fairly flat mine is just feminine. If it’s hand made it should be easy to make it like the picture. Don’t get me wrong it’s nice and fit right but smh. What a disappointment that was. All that waiting time and money for me to flatten it out myself or pay more for someone else to do it.,Negative

Not worth it Worn once one of the jewels fell off,Negative
"Not like I thought it would be I thought they would be bigger, they are the size of a small key ring as you can see in the photo. They seem a little flimsy. I will use the item, hopefully it will not break quickly. I’m not angry about them but, I probably won’t buy again.",Negative
I didn’t want to give them any stars but it made me pick stars like I said zero stars The stones were doll one of the earrings didn’t hang right.

Pretty dissapointed. ⭐️ ⭐️=shipping & price",Negative

"Doesn't fit over my bird's head Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit",Negative

"So small These are great quality.  But it's obviously for NOT for anyone with medium or large wrists. I was fooled by the pictures.  I thought the bracelets were thicker and just more substantial than what they actually are. Measure your wrists before purchase, and don't expect the bracelets to be like the pic.",Negative
Do not buy this Nope. The word handmade is very misleading. This is a literal photocopy of something that someone may have made. It's is printed on photo paper. I was going to give it to my mother.

Avoid at all costs unless you want to look like a greaser from the 50s.",Negative

"Not gold This item does not say what material is made of, I bought it thinking it had gold in it. When I used it, it completely infected my nose piercing in two days. I’m allergic to most metals but not the gold filled ones, not sure if this has any gold in it but not worth the few dollars it costs",Negative
Buyer Beware! Poor Quality!! I was very dissatisfied! Poor Quality ring base. Stone looked to be manufactured. The inclusions were more like plastic chips then organic debris. The stone was loose in the setting. Being a third party the normally straight forward Amazon return policy does not apply.<br />The seller accepted the return of sent to Istanbul Turkey at my expense. This would have cost me more than half the price of the Ring itself. I saw this stipulation nowhere in the ad for this item.,Negative
Just print it your self I literally could have printed this myself at home. It is just printed glossy paper. Complete disappointment. Do not waste your money.,Negative
"Have extra backings, they didn’t fit Very pretty but the backings that came with the earrings didn’t fit. One of them fell out of my ear during the day never to be seen again. Also when tou put them on notice that they can’t go in the same direction unless you put them in only one ear.",Negative

"No Scent & Gritty What a disappointment. There is a very slight hint of honeysuckle which dissipates the moment you put the powder on.

It breaks easily It last 2 weeks,Negative
Much too heavy to be titanium.  Don't even think about buying at this price. Without a doubt this is not pure titanium. This should feel as light as aluminum. Feels like and looks like stainless steel.  Rip-off at this price. Should be priced at about $20 - $25.  I will return for money back.,Negative
"Well made, but TIGHT! This sheath is very well made.  Looks very good and the inclusion of the belt loop is nice.  The biggest problem with this sheath is how tight it is.  I’m talking dangerously tight.  I put my BK9 in and it took everything I had to get it out.  A very dangerous situation for yourself and anyone around.  The price is reasonable for what you get, but at that price range you’d expect a better fit for your knives.  I’m sure there’s a way to reheat it and get a better fit but for a custom made sheath it’s too dangerous as is.",Negative

"False Advertising My sister bought these for me as a gift. The image made them look so beautiful. While I do like the earrings sent to me, these are NOT $30 earrings. I could have made these just as easily. I feel so bad that my sister spent so much money on these earrings because they hardly resemble the image. Cheap craft glitter was used too and the image clearly shows flakes of some sort. Honestly just a disappointment.",Negative

"Do not buy Ring looks nothing like pictures. Stone sits a good 2 cm above band which makes it look like something out of a gumball machine.

Buy at your own risk- it costs more than the ring to send it back!",Negative

Very small NOTHING LIKE PIC Very small compared to what it actually looks like in photo here. Super bummed out 😔,Negative
Name placement too High Name is placement is too high on the bracelet!  It looks as though the lower case l was first stamped as an i- with a dot on the top then restamped as an l over it.<br />Not happy with my purchase.  Also this four letter name was spread out over the whole bracelet.  It makes it look as though they were just trying to fill the space.  I contacted the seller.  Still waiting to hear back.,Negative

I can't put this in a frame since the frame would cut off the letter.  This was to be a gift but I would be embarrassed to give it to someone.

"Dead starfish are pretty? It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.",Negative

It claims to be 10”, but from the top of the ear to the bottom of the wreath, it is 7”. From ear to ear across, it is only 9”. I feel like I was completely ripped off.",Negative

Turned BLACK I LOVE these hoops. I use them for my first and second piercings. They are so comfortable I’ve left them in for nearly a month at a time. I forget they’re there. And they’re absolutely adorable!<br />The only thing I don’t like is that the silver literally turned BLACK. This could have just been a fluke in the one earring because it only occurred in the one earring. I will be ordering a new set to see if this happens again. Will update in a few months!<br /><br />UPDATE: The new ones also turned black after a few weeks! Save your money and just don't buy these! I am returning the new ones and wont be buying again. They are cheap quality,Negative

"I don't love these I don't love these. They are very dainty, which I wanted, but because there is no real clasp to them and you just have to close the ends together they get stuck in my ear and it hurts. I'm constantly adjusting them to makw them look okay. They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes. I probably wouldn't buy these again. Very light weight and dainty but that was the only part I liked about them",Negative
It was unfortunately not handled with care:( Wish they had put it in a box. The cam had a dent the Santa letter was tearing from one end. The only thing that wasn’t destroyed was the elf. Perfect gift! It was just damaged on its way to our home:(,Negative
Ring was too small Ordered a size 8 and I don’t know what size it is but it doesn’t fit and it’s not returnable,Negative
"Not the Poly you’re looking for I love Columbia’s fragrances, however this one is less than desirable. I was expecting something similar to the scent of the Poly. This is not it.",Negative
Fail I usually buy these on the boardwalk. I moved to a landlocked state and missed home. So I grabbed these. I am disappointed. These are low quality and cheap.,Negative
not as sturdy as in the sellers pic bent too easy and once in nose doesn't hold form when you re close it. rolls around and catches. swelling occurred overnight. super tiny only 5 year olds can manipulate it. i contemplated tweezers if that helps,Negative
very cute but This watch band is very cute. I love the design but no matter what i did it would fit right. My watch didnt recognize that i was wearing it all day. I adjusted it all fay and once i moved my arm it would move and bunch up.,Negative
No bueno. Este producto venia totalmente en mal estado.tengan cuidado hacer pedidos de este tipo,Negative
"Doesn't stick to ALL types of Walls Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.",Negative
My boyz Not what I thought it would be,Negative
Disappointed I got this as a Christmas gift for my best friend and I am very disappointed with the way it looks.,Negative
Not so good Just realize you won’t know it’s in a package of you ordered other things. I threw this out because I didn’t realize it was in a package with other items I ordered. What a waste of money.,Negative
NO!! Nothing more than a xerox copy.  Not worth more than $1.99.,Negative
Way smaller than expected did not fit expected area Them is flexible but way too small to put in ear maybe for a baby but not an adult,Negative
"Will tarnish I loved these when they first arrived, but after just two weeks of wear, they were so badly tarnished that a silver polish cloth wouldn't remove the tarnish. When I contacted the seller, she recommended cleaning them every time I wear them and keeping them in a sealed plastic bag when I wasn't wearing them, but the tarnish is so bad they're unwearable. Though I'd asked for a refund or replacement, she ignored those questions. Buyer beware.",Negative
"Not worth buying. The Name beads fell off and the Names on Beads rubbed off within 2 Days. The clasp doesn't stay closed, so my Husband stopped wearing it because he would lose it due to falling (clasp doesn't hold) off several times a Day",Negative
Bead I like it but the bead always slips down under my wrist ..  no Bueno,Negative
"Not worth it. Ordered 2T for my daughter's second birthday in June, and doesn't even fit now. Wayy too small. Graphics on shirt are also kind of faded. Wouldn't purchase again.",Negative

Two Stars Does not burn well in a scentsy,Negative
Feels kinda cheap I've bought a necklace from this company before and loved it so I thought I would buy another one and was sadly disappointed. The beads are small and very lightweight. I was expecting something with more substance than what I received.,Negative
One Star Poor quality rusted on me less then month of having:( love the style of ring thou,Negative
Not impressed. I ordered the 5 pack set and wasn’t really impressed.  The price was reasonable. The Oder was great the first day then quickly disappeared. One to two days tops is all you can expect with this product an then you will need to change out the wax.  I’ve used others that lasted longer.,Negative
"Way too small Super cute, got them as a gift but wish they were bigger",Negative
Not the best nose ring purchase. Would make a better ear ring or something else. The ball and opal already fell off.  Offer only about a week. It still has one left but that isn’t why I purchased it. And it doesn’t close properly hence why they fell off to begin with which pinches the inside of your nose constantly.,Negative
It’s literally just a piece of paper. I truly wouldn’t waste ur money like I did. Maybe I mis read the reviews but I thought this was supposed to be a poster like quality or on canvas. It’s literally a piece of paper that I could have printed at home on glossy paper. I was so disappointed to give this as a gift. Thankfully she loved it anyway because I thought of her so there’s that.,Negative
Low gauge paper Great design but was surprised when I received them that they were just printed on a slightly higher gauge of paper than what you use in your printer day today.  Would suggest a more sunstantial/stiffer material to resemble more what is placed on the doors at hotels.,Negative
Don’t buy Damaged my ears,Negative
Paper  with printed saying but no frame Just paper - not framed  have to read description of this product it has no frame,Negative
"Write ""s"" at the end. EDIT: As pretty as it is, the rug sadly does not last long. After 3 weeks of continued use, the name has almost completely faded. Would NOT recommend.<br /><br />It would've been nice to know if the ""s"" at the end needs to be added when customizing or if it gets automatically added when being made. Apparently it needs to be added when customizing.",Negative
"Visible knot, little color Disappointed. Ordered for a gift and was not going to open the package but am glad I did. The knot is visible and and too big to hide inside a bead. Not sure yet if I will try to cover the knot with a bead or send it back. Also, there is very little color variation in the tiger's eye so this is about 90% black (boring).",Negative
"Turned black Turned dark within a week of wear, not sure if it's silver. My ears did not have a positive reaction",Negative
"Item so small you can’t read inscription without reading glasses I am very disappointed.  This was going to be a gift, now not so sure.  I had this engraved  but this is so small  you need reading glasses to see inscription.",Negative

"Not ""Natural Free Shape "" Bought the ring for my fiance because it was advertised as natural free shape and she loves natural shaped pearls. Once recieved, the ring looks almost perfectly round, not even close to the natural shape shown in the picture.",Negative
"D20 Dragon Pendant *UPDATE* After I gave this to my friend, she went two days and one of the horns fell off according to her. She wears pendants and such quite often so I don't think it was a matter of carelessness on her part. I haven't seen how broken the piece is but when it's a gift that breaks after just two days, it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift and I must say the customization in colors and design are great. I love the selection that's available and it really helps to make it a unique gift. At first I didn't know if it would be too big, since I've seen some 20 sided die that are huge, but it's a perfect size to display the dragon and die without being too heavy. Awesome work, you rolled a 20",Negative
Gaudy Too large to wear,Negative

"Reading is Paramount ohhhhhh LOL did comedy serve my non reading self right with this purchase!!!.  Deciding to go with a Sunflowers type theme in my bathroom which was the reasoning behind this purchase that failed me miserably.  I saw the pictures of the sunflowers and completely failed to read any other description about the pics..  O snap!! Amazon delivers it and I'm looking for a  very small box, at least,  and a box I did receive if it's the size of a FedEx overnight envelope!!! I opened it and the the 3 pictures were like the flimsy 8x10's that come in the 20 dollar elementary school portrait package from back in the Dinosaur era.  I giggled uncontrollably, for a few at my misfortune and politely sealed the envelope back up and placed in the spring cleaning in the summer box!!!",Negative
Misrepresented size These earrings are very beautiful and well-made — but much smaller than I expected. The images make them appear much bigger than they actually are. I feel deceived.,Negative
Toooo small The words were micro small.,Negative

"Two Stars I find it very expensive, so it is the product.",Negative
Too thick The sticker started peeling off within a day after one use of inserting into a chip reader. The corners of the sticker need to be thinner so they don’t peel so bad.,Negative
"Seems cheap, not what I expected. I thought this would be nicer looking, but the materials are cheap.  Bad purchase for the money.",Negative
"Lining Makes It Hard To Breathe I bought this for my mom. She did lot like the lining because it made it hard to breathe. She cut it out and the pleats came apart. Now it’s a giant piece of fabric. It’s super cute, but just didn’t fit our needs.",Negative
Don't waste your money I don't even know where to begin. Useless piece of metal.,Negative
"Not 24k This is gold plate, not gold. Very, very deceptive advertisement. Only in the specifications do find out it isn’t gold. Metal type: vermeil. That is another word for gold plate.",Negative
Not even It doesn't line up very well... and the stickers over lay oddly.  So I don't advise using on a color band that is way bolder than the sticker.,Negative
Not a good earring for me The part of this earring that was actually in my ear turned black and fell apart,Negative
From a color printer This is definitely not the quality I would expect for a color print. Could have used my inkjet and saved some money!,Negative
Leather emblem was off I had to add glue on it. The leather emblem came out good but the placement to the hat was not. It wasn’t glued to the hat correctly. It was a gift so I don’t have time to send it back. I added glue and did my best to make it stay on.,Negative

They don’t come in frames Very disappointed was not like I expected,Negative
Size I like the product but I wish it was bigger for the price,Negative
Not as expected It’s cute but not quite what I was expecting. Over priced for just being words printed on card stock with no frame. I had to purchase a frame separately. I realized after receiving it that it doesn’t come with one but the picture advertised shows it in a frame.,Negative
Buyer beware! 1 Take an old junky wall outlet cover.<br />2 print out a collage of my little pony characters and glue it to said outlet cover.<br />Charge 9$ for this and claim a high quality product.<br />Literally could have made this myself. If I had known how little effort when into making this item I wouldn't have ever purchased this. Way too much money for the quality of this item. Very disappointing.,Negative
"Not quite right I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.",Negative
Flimsy Fell apart when I went to put them on. Terrible material,Negative
"Very misleading I was pretty disappointed in these when I got them! The look of them is very vintage, but in the description it makes it sound like they are printed on a type of paper that will have that vintage feel to them but instead they came printed on glossy photo paper... kinda ruins the whole vintage/old look I was going for. Very misleading when they call it “Archive paper”.",Negative
"Spelling error Amazing is spelled with a ‘z’. This is either spelled with a ‘r’ or ‘c’.

Spell check It’s Judgment. Not “Judgement”!,Negative
Nose ring is Not the Size Pictured...Make sure to check actual sizing listed... The product was shown as being bigger than actual size.  The nose ring is Very Small and is Definitely Not Worth the Money I paid for it Sorry to say...I was looking forward to doing business with company but I Definitely will Not be ordering anything else from them. ☹,Negative
"Does not look like advertised photo of ametrine Just like another person said in their review, these earrings do not look like ametrine, but rather pieces of glass. I am absolutely embarrassed that I bought this as a present for a family member. My advice is go get some decent faceted amethyst earrings. I’m sure you’ll be able to get much better for the price that you’ll pay for these.",Negative
Not recommended Waste of money. Leaves a red mark on your nose. Might as well get a real piercing and it heals up later,Negative
"Disappointment I bought from this selling in good faith but when I got the peace I didn’t feel an energy. So I contacted someone who researches stones and she did some research on the company first and then she checked my stone out. She told me from everything she had seen with the website my moldavite was not real, then I gave her the stone and she confirmed it. I tried contacted seller for a refund and have been ghosted. I should have gone with my gut on this and did some more research. Don’t waste your money",Negative
Two Stars The clasp is not secure.,Negative
"Not What I Expected It looks like any other mask but it does have a larger chin area.  I don't see how some with a thick beard could benefit from this.  My husband has a goatee and he found the mask uncomfortable even though I ordered a large size.  After it was washed and air dried, the mask seemed to have shrunk and was wrinkly; I did smooth out the mask before hanging it to dry.",Negative
Too big for smaller noses It was to large for my nose.. it didn't stay in place.,Negative
Does not stick well The script was beautiful but it did NOT want to stick to the wall. Very difficult to get off of the backing and already wants to peel back off of the wall. I don’t think it will last long!,Negative
Ehh... Cute but not vibrant or glitter like it shows..,Negative
Too tiny not usable Very tiny and you cannot return them to order different ones.,Negative
Was cracked inside and very cheap. waiting A long time for this and when it came was in bad shape Just looked old and beat up.,Negative

Photo The picture doesn't really look like the actual ring.  The stone was pretty but the metal is not good quality.,Negative
"Didn’t like I ordered my regular size but they are WAY too big. The thong/strap is rough and felt like it may produce a blister if worn too long. Too bad for me, the seller refuses to refund my money since each pair is ‘custom’ created. Which means they snapped the cheap ‘jewel’ onto the middle of the thong.<br />Don’t buy from this seller!!! If you end up not liking your purchase, too bad, they keep your money!!!",Negative
"Bulkier than I thought While I like the colors, the earrings are bulkier next to my face than I had hoped.",Negative
"Inaccurate description about items I ordered a couple of months ago and the product description says push pins are included at that time. The product didn’t include any push pins and seller apologized for the incorrect description, but didn’t send it. I am disappointed and need to order push pin from other vendor. Also, the map of USA doesn’t have USA written anywhere which is also weird.",Negative

Disappointing Damaged product. I ordered 4 add on pieces and they were all scratched and badly gouged. I will not be using any of the pieces and would not recommend this product to anyone.,Negative

Does not resemble the picture at all.a lot smaller Didn't like anything,Negative
Goes agaisnt sound developmental practice I have been in early childhood education for almost 40 years.This item goes against all sound developmental practice. It probably hinders walking.

"Arrived broken & missing ear hook This pair arrived in an plastic bag that was old and what appeared contained smalls holes all over as if chewed by something  and missing on one earring was the actual hook that goes through your ear. I ordered several pairs from this seller. Whereas the design part of the earrings are lovely, they are very simply made & poor craftsmanship. Several sets arrived with the pieces separated & required me to assemble them & tighten sections with needle nose pliers!? They are extremely lightweight as advertised which actually is nice. However there absolutely needs to be better quality assembly required on the sellers end. As is they are definitely not worth upwards of $20 by any means.",Negative

"Poor quality I'm sorry to give a bad review, but unfortunately this product wasn't good quality. The wood box was cheap with a loose hinge, and the paint was acrylic with no sealant or buff coat. I could see pencil lines shining through the paint, and design lines were uneven.<br /><br />Basically, it was not worth $25. More like something I could buy at a craft fair for $7.

FRAUDULENT I bought this product last year as a gift. It was beautiful but then discolored. This is NOT 16k gold as it is described. This is a lie and is fraudulent advertising. Not acceptable for amazon to sell.,Negative

Cheap beads I bought this about the beads are already turning from silver to a copper color. Very disappointed.,Negative
Disappointed 😏 They forgot the jump rings so the earrings faced sideways. Wiring didn’t match up. Not very well put together.,Negative
nice looking but thin Nice logo on the shirt but the fabric is way too thin and see through for my taste. It seemed thicker on the pictures.,Negative

Green finger?!? If this ring is sterling silver why will your finger turn green? I’m waiting for two that Ive purchased and I don’t want this if my finger will turn green. False advertising to say it’s sterling silver. I have many sterling rings and my finger has never turned green.,Negative

It’s a photo It was just a photo that has to be framed. I wouldn’t expect that to be called “wall art.”,Negative
"Not sterling silver.... I bought these earrings because they state that they are sterling sliver. I have a metal allergy and can only wear pure gold or 925 sterling silver. Within 90 seconds of putting the earrings on my ears started itching. Beautiful earrings, but I can't wear them.",Negative
Not the same color as displayed Not the color in the picture at all. Very bright green.,Negative
"WARNING: Do NOT buy these, you will not use them!! I bought these as a gift for a friend who showed me some &#34;Druzy&#34; ear rings she liked. What I received in this order is NOTHING like the ones my friend showed me, but about the same price. I didn't expect much for the price, but I can not say enough about what garbage these things are, especially compared to the ones I was trying to match. The pictures will say enough.<br /><br />First, where are the backings?!<br /><br />Second, the bezels are not &#34;rose gold&#34;, as far as I can tell, not even a &#34;rose gold&#34; plate. Maybe some kind of paint or stain?<br /><br />One of the center pieces has a chip out of it and one of them has the center piece set so far off center, you can see it from several feet away which is made even more obvious because the centers are too small for the bezels. (Same as the other pair I bought.) There's also corrosion of some kind on one of the center pieces.<br /><br />Finally, there's no way I would want my friend to actually put these things through her skin. The posts are NASTY. They've already got some kind of corrosion on them and they're not smooth. (Also like the other pair I bought.)<br /><br />I don't know if these are really &#34;handmade&#34; or not, but they look like something bought for 10 cents each in a bag of 1000 from China.<br /><br />(I bought a second pair in another color and it suffered every one of the same problems plus some.) Now I have to waste my time sending them back.",Negative
Not dishwasher safe Laser engraved items aren't dishwasher safe.,Negative
Smaller than expected This was OK but smaller than a regular sheet of paper. It was well made with important information for the year and laminated but smaller than expected. This disappointment was totally my fault for not taking diligence to double check the sizing. Great item if you don't want to hang as a large poster. My fault.,Negative

Ripped off Could not us any of the six tiles purchased !! Tiles are a photo !  Not a glazed ceramic! For $15 each they sould be a durable surface!!!!!,Negative
The Quality of the necklace I am very disappointed with this necklace.  I gave it to my wife for Valentine's Day and she wore it one time and the chain turned black in sections.  Very embarrassing.  The charm also faded from its original shiny colors.,Negative
"Do not stick! I needed these for an important project and was excited when they arrived (one day late) - but they don't stick!  They are all dried out.  Because I don't have time to return them as I need this project to get done, I had to use what I could by taping the dots on.  This is ugly and wasn't why I bought these!  I'm very disappointed in this product.",Negative
Packaging sucks [[VIDEOID:7e0dc8d407ebabbabe1974da03181572]] Package came and I opened it and it looks like this. I hope it is better then it looks. It looks like it was used and repackaged.,Negative

Two Stars Very light weight material. I debated returning it because it felt cheep to me.,Negative
Cute. Delicate. 2 different sizes. Broke quickly. Very cute! They seem extremely breakable.  I'm not sure if one roll is supposed to be bigger than the other but it bothers me...<br /><br />*Updated. One of the earrings broke after about 10 uses.,Negative

Cheap The scene was nic but left much to be desired.,Negative
Terrible quality The wire part was broken right out of the box. Not worth the money.,Negative
Looks cheap Engraving is blurry/smudged. Looks very cheap.,Negative
"The price isn't worth the quality of the product. I was disappointed with the shirt. I ordered a purple shirt. When I got it, they had used black letters on a dark shirt. The letters actually looked like iron on letters. I don't understand why light letters aren't used on dark colored shirts. I had to buy fabric paint so that the words can be seen.",Negative
Weak metal Metal started bending and disfiguring after short time of gentle wear. Wouldn't buy again.,Negative
Cute Super cute ring but did not fit was way to small I would go up a size if you are buying this,Negative
Dime size and very light weight! Pretty and innovative but not asubstantial piece of jewelry.  Small and lightweight.  Looks like it could easily break.  I returned it.,Negative
Bad quality and even worse customer service The metal piece is poor quality and very sharp. It cut my infant son as my husband was wearing it. The company was not responsive to my messages. I would not recommend this product or this company by any means.,Negative
One Star it was worn for two weeks and it already tarnish. very upsetting,Negative
"Nice hooks, but you have to buy your own screws The hook is the perfect size,  color and style that I wanted.  They seem sturdy. I went to hang it today and found out that the holes in the hook are too small for the black screws that were provided. I went to the hardware store and couldn't find any small enough in black. Now I'll need to find some black paint to put on the top of the screw after I install it. Makes my cost higher and a simple project take longer,  which is frustrating.  FYI - #4 × 3/4 is the size of wood screw that fit my hooks. I could have ordered a package of 100 from Amazon in the black that I needed but didn't want to spend that $11 for the amount of screws I needed.",Negative
Looked fake I make jewelry for fun. It looks more polished than this particular bracelet,Negative
Ehhh...it was okay It was an alright purchase. U was a little disappointed in how faded the print was. It looked more vibrant online. It also looked like an iron on vinyl I could of made it at home.  I guess you get what you pay for.,Negative
"Cheap junk This is exactly what you see, in plastic on a flimsy piece of nylon string. The weight of the pendant isn’t enough to straighten out the cord. I’m really disappointed.<br /><br />I returned it and got some thing better at a lower price.",Negative
"No Scent Not only did I wait a long time to receive the item, it did not smell at all!!",Negative
"I am extremely disappointed in my order I am extremely disappointed in my order. I ordered 3 stackable rings and the names are not even legible!! The stones look like they are not set well and will fall out. This was for a gift, I wish it had come in a ring box instead of a plastic bag.",Negative
"Not really sure what stone it is Marketed as turquoise but when I received both pair, they are more of a green stone, not so much turquoise.",Negative
Not as expected I thought I was getting 3 earrings - you get one very very very tiny pair for the price.  Not worth it!  Plus there were defects on the face of both earrings.,Negative
Ok Nut They broke . Did wear but once and they broke!!!,Negative
Very disappointed Very disappointed in this. For the price is Looks like it was rushed. Smudged paint and marks all over the wood.,Negative
Ended up returning They’re very thin like they could easily break & the name engraving is so small & thin you can barely see it,Negative
Good colour but stiff as a board and scratchy. REturn Cost more than than the item Significant problem with this order was that there was NO packing slip with details about order and NOTHING about the seller. I suspect this was deliberate.<br />Took ages to get permission for return. Very secretive seller.,Negative
"Can’t see it…very disappointed Bought them for our 10 year wedding anniversary and they are what I expected, very disappointed. You can’t see the writing on the glasses. There wasn’t an option for the color of the letters. In the advertised photos the font is dark but they are not. Don’t waste your money.",Negative

"No customer support... Product looked great, packaged great. Arrived with a broken frame and I sent 2 messages to the seller within 4 business days. No reply.

"Not Worth the Money Edit:<br />I discovered the finish on the links wears off which gave me a rash on my wrist. I cannot return the band due to it being six days past the Amazon return window. I am so disappointed and also out $30, which is a large sum for a retiree.<br /><br />I love my new silver Fitbit bracelet. It is stylish and comfortable to wear. I like using the clasp much better than the buckle on the plain black band that came with my Fitbit.<br /><br />I did not find that attaching the bracelet to my Fitbit was overly complicated. Plus the seller sent extra pins in case of loss. Also, there were additional links to make the bracelet larger.<br /><br />I love my new bracelet, and I am glad I spent the bucks to buy it.",Negative
False advertizement. Low quality product Im pretty dissapointed in this product. Not as the product description descrined. The small stones in the head of the stem are literally plastic beads. Tou can actually see the thread holes through the sides. The weight is terribly out of proportion. I wouldnt habe bought this if i had known what low quality this was going to be. Am definitely going to try and send back for a refund.,Negative
Falls apart after a few weeks I got my wife one for Christmas. Within a few weeks the paper was peeling off of the board. I contacted the company and they were nice and sent another one. The images here show the second one. It also peeled off the board within a few weeks. Definitely not worth 100 dollars.,Negative
"You may not get a lovely rose colored chrystal at all. The picture of the Rose Quartz ‘leather chain’ pendant was a lovely pink, and even though the product info indicated that the quartz you receive will not look exactly like the picture, I expected the ‘rose’ color to be beautifully apparent.  Instead, the pink on the quartz chrystal appeared white.  The leather chord from which the chrystal is suspended looks very cheap.  For some, the weight of the fairly large chrystal may be uncomfortable.  I would give the product ‘no stars,’ but the “submit” wouldn’t work if I didn’t.",Negative
"Poor making Elastic made , easily broken but nice and simple",Negative
"It's a photo The description now says not a tin sign, but this item is clearly SEO'd to come up when you search tin signs because that's how I found it. My bad. Not worth $12 for a piece of paper.",Negative
"print is just perfect The print of dog paws with names is absolutely the best idea, so sweet. The tshirt quality is terrible, thin, and cheap. If the shirt material was quality it would be a perfect 10. I'm afraid to wash it because I am sure it will shrink and fall apart.",Negative
Very poor material Poor Quality material.,Negative
comfortable Don’t like how it feels.,Negative
"Disappointed This piece is not as pretty as the picture.  It reminds me of something an old woman would have.  It is a nice size, but just nothing special about it.  Nothing like the beauty of the photo.",Negative
"Disappointing It does smell decent! But the package comes without any direction of how much to use or the ingredients inside. I did try it, using like I do my other bath salts and there was zero fizzing. It also had a hard time dissolving. It kind of sat there lumpy until I mushed it around. Turned the water a murky color. I thought it was lame so I added more water and bubble bath and I had no bubbles which usually work fine. It's like it sucked all the joy from my bath. I wouldn't buy this or give to a friend.",Negative
"Breaks easy A little disappointed. I think I’ve had this product for 5 months, and out of nowhere the latch broke on it and I had to Toss it.",Negative
"Couldn’t give as a gift unless it’s for an infant It’s not what I expected, it’s too small to give us a gift unless it’s for an infant. The quality is great but everything else is not worth the money and it’s ridiculously small to be considered a gift.",Negative
Nice but be aware that if you order from this ... Nice but be aware that if you order from this company and you want to return something-its a 20% restocking fee and the customer pays for the return back. IMO not worth it. Product is just OK. Not really great.,Negative
Too small It keeps a few needles accessible but it is too small for large projects.,Negative
"Very pretty Very pretty, uncomfortable to wear, kind of pinches my ear. May not pinch yours though !",Negative
"Suoer cute but broke within a week! I thought the bracelet was really cute. However, within the first week it got caught on something and the clasp broke.",Negative
Broke within 1 min of wearing I bought 2 of these because I really liked the colors and the look.  Within 1 minute of wearing the first one it broke and can not be fixed.  I haven't even tried to wear the 2nd one because I fear they will both break.  Don't Waste Your Money!,Negative
Two Stars Smallish and poor print quality.,Negative

Not an ornament This was a Matchbox car with a line and a mini tree tied with a ribbon to the hood. Bought a different ornament from someone else.,Negative

"Don't Bother To Buy - This Is A Major Disapointment This product asked for 6 extra dollars to arrive a blue gift box, and instead it came in a trashy looking bland cardboard box. I have better and cuter gift boxes lying around my house I could've used, so that was a major let down.<br />And the chain came knotted and I couldn't unknot it! I tried gifting this to my mother but even she couldn't get it loose.<br />Also some of the engraved letters have a bit of a smudge.<br />Please, please, please save your money and look elsewhere.",Negative
Probably good for inactive people I'm giving this product two stars because in theory it was a great idea. However the reality of it is there's more bulk that's easier to catch on objects and the tape gets sweaty which is detrimental to keeping the omnipod on.,Negative
"Sign was scuffed up. Seller put the word ""and"" right after the grooms name. The bottom corner was imperfect and the word 'and' was added right after the Grooms first name and should have been between the names.  Very unhappy with this product.  i do not recommend this seller.",Negative

Chain Broke within 2 days of wearing! The pendant is very nicely engraved and my boyfriend loves it however the chain broke in 2 places already and it has only been 10 days since he started wearing it.

No way to hang it properly on a wall I ordered a “E” . I personally thought it was pretty but everyone else I showed says it doesn’t look like a E. It’s been 9 months since I bought it and it’s still not on the wall since I have no clue how to properly/ safely hang it over my baby’s crib without putting nails it through and nail holes in the pink wood letter .,Negative
Not worth the price You could print these off at your local CVS - absolutely nothing special for the price,Negative
Not as I had hoped. Lettering was off and not symmetrical. Disappointed 😞,Negative

Can’t smell it! I bought this for my bedroom but could not smell it. I moved it to my guest bathroom. A 6 x 6 bathroom…. You still cant smell it! Way too expensive to not work. I can’t return it because I threw out the top and the box! Don’t buy it.,Negative

Small Turned out a lot smaller than I was expecting especially since advertised that it was for a Yeti Tumbler.,Negative
Fabric Poor fabric quality. Order a M cause that's my husband size and it's bigger like 2 sizes more. Disgusting with this order M and comes like XL,Negative
"Spend more money elsewhere This is the most irritating purchase I think I’ve made, the pieces have no structure to them they’re super fragile, the finished image above is nowhere near what you are purchasing (seller needs to remove that image), half the prints don’t line up with the small rod assembly holes, they’re no instructions whatsoever, and you have to provide your own assembly rods, the butt stock is literally 2 different sizes, this seller needs to seriously address the quality of their products and redesign most of them, this isn’t the only item I’ve been severely disappointed with from them, you’re much better off going to an Etsy shop and spending a bit more money, it will be a much better investment.",Negative

In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it.

Cute but disappointed! I was super excited to get a custom shirt.  Super soft!  But didn’t even get through one day of wearing and the material started to peel/fray.  The letters look great.  But I feel maybe I should just frame it and make it a decoration near my workout area instead.,Negative

Cup is well made but stick is not applied on well House Stark Symbol was already coming off when it arrived at my house.,Negative
Pointless I’m not sure why this is even a thing. It doesn’t break down buildup. It has a color so it’s making you believe it worked or works and it really ain’t doing anything,Negative
A disappointment. I am very disappointed by this product. The letters are not as neat as they pictures show. My daughters name starts with a M and the M has thick mountains which make it look very cheap. I am upset with myself for spending this much money on this.,Negative

Not hypoallergenic Was soooo disappointed! I wanted a lavender eyeshadow to bring out my green eyes- but I have always been allergic to red and blue dye....so it trashed my eyes....I ended up rubbing it all off...also it was very light blue,Negative

Don’t waste your money! I felt disappointed! Very poor construction and wood isn’t really a hard wood. More like birdhouse wood. Small sign and the color is way off from the picture.<br />Don’t waste your money!,Negative
"Packaged with care, and the print is nice, but not impressed I wanted to use the pictures for the bathroom. The simplicity of the design is nice, but I’m not sure if it fits what I wanted. Either way, I have it but have not been able to use it.",Negative

Cheap A week late and a dollar short chinnsy for the money,Negative
Sizing was a joke This bracelet was so delicate and beautiful although not very durable but I wasn’t looking for that. But when I opened the box it was a very small child size. I have small wrists but this literally fit on two fingers. I have it to my 3 year old Granddaughter and it fit her perfectly.,Negative

Blame it on the Postal System This product is not the quality of a similar product that I have purchased elsewhere in the past.  The glitter is only on one side of the words.  The vinyl is very thin and floppy.  The wooden skewers that are glued to the vinyl of course get cake icing on them making you wonder if it is safe to use again.  This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.,Negative

Cork screw part is too big The cork screw is really big. You can see it coming out of your nostril and it’s not a good look. The design is nice but unfortunately I can’t wear it because of how big the wrap around piece is,Negative
If I can give no stars I would. MAKE SURE YOU READ DESCRIPTION. The order DOES NOT match the pictures of the product so don’t base yourself off of that. This product is NOT FRAMED. You literally get PAPER PICTURES. Paid 45$ for PAPER PICTURES. DO NOT ORDER. Not to mention they don’t accept returns because they are “customs” yet you don’t have a choice to choose out of different pictures so I don’t see what’s custom about it. Hilarious. I hope you go out of business since you like to just rip people off. :) PS you should think about putting a realistic picture of the product... oh wait you can’t cause no one in their right mind would buy. Lesson learned,Negative

"Junk not worth the paper it's printed on This is a cheap (and I mean cheap) drug store photo print. There is nothing ""handcrafted"" about it, and by made in the USA they clearly mean went to the closest walmart to get a quit print out done. It's not even on quality paper.<br /><br />Avoid the hassle and purchase a decent product from a decent seller.",Negative
Too big in looks .big stone looks like plastic and return exchange is very very expensive The made is ggood but the big stone in center looks like plastic and is a very big ring as a whole..if you are in USA please be careful to order anything from there bcaz if u wana return any thing you will have to pay shipping lot more than cost of the item and run around of the seller,Negative

"If you are not patient, do not purchase! I hope the maker of these decals is working on an easier way to adhere them to a wall because I can't imagine they get many repeat customers. The designs are beautiful, but the process might have you second guessing your decision. The process takes days: 1. flatten decal for 24 hours 2. Apply decal to wall and let adhere for 24 hours 3. SLOWLY and CAREFULLY remove backing w/out ruining decal: at least 1 hour. It looks good, but it was rough-going several times. Review update: after all that effort, the decal is bubbling up and not sticking in some spots. I removed a star as a result. Buyer beware.",Negative

Great idea - cheaply made This was a great idea but very disappointing because it’s SO cheaply made. It’s very soft and flimsy and will not keep its shape. Would have been great if it was better quality. Not worth the money being charged for it.,Negative

So small! This is smaller and less thick than something you could print at home. Does not make sense to buy,Negative
"Not absorbent and wicking - stays wet. I washed product as directed -twice, with no softener of any kind. Dried it and placed in the clean cage. Within hours parts of it were soaked and the debris such as hay, straw pellets and poop would not entirely sweep up because they were sticking to the wet spots. Within a day I had to change the cage back to the paper bedding I was using because it stunk. The positive points are - it is a very cute print, is well sewn and thick. It was a generous size with some material left over.",Negative
Way smaller than advertised They seemed cheap and much smaller than shown,Negative
"LovED It It fell off and was list the first time I wore it. But right up until then I loved it. I just had it on a thin blouse, so nothing was tugging. Must be a tad heavy for the magnet. I had ordered another design, but now I am too afraid to wear it.",Negative

"Cheaply Made I wanted to love these so bad. But I just couldn’t. They seem very cheaply made. Even when you open and close them then way the seller says to, they still bend and contort/disfigure the round shape. And then you can’t get it back to a circle shape again. And the ends of mine came tarnished. Just very unhappy with the product. Will be returning these sadly.",Negative
Not worth the purchase Flimsy cardstock.,Negative
"Huge towel Bought two cat dishtowels and loved them.  I should have noticed the dimensions on this one.  It is huge.  Also, the screen printing is in the center section of the towel.  This makes it impossible to hang and see the design.",Negative
Came curled and bent If it hadn't been curled (the tips of arms/legs) or bent - the midsections - this was a great piece and saved me the trouble of having to build it.,Negative
Disappointed Gift for my daughter on wedding day and wording was done wrong  by you. I ordered because of how it read and living now reads Going.,Negative
"Garbage, looks tacky & just poor digital printing Sadly, this did have potential...if what had been sent looked remotely like the photos. Unfortunately, the 3D printing quality on the one I received was disturbingly pitiful. I ended-up getting the same type/look item from a different seller that actually took care and had proper quality control on what they allowed to be shipped to customers. I did attempt to reach out and did not receive a response. It is what it is and this went in the charity donation bin.",Negative

"Bad Infection & Tarnishing I bought this nose ring almost 2 months ago but have only been wearing it for a few weeks. It caused a nasty infection in my nose for a couple weeks even though I cleaned the nose ring with alcohol and used clean hands when putting it in. I noticed this week that it is already tarnished so I will have to replace this nose ring. I am bummed, it was my first experience with a hoop and I loved the look but it's not worth the infection and already having to replace it after only a few weeks of wearing it :(",Negative
Two Stars It was pretty but did not last long.,Negative
Didn’t clean This didn’t give the detox clean I expected. Hair still had build up after multiple soaks.,Negative

Cut on top Won't purchase this again. Wish I would've noticed that it was cut on top. It was easy to put in though. It surprisingly hasn't came out yet either.

Not worth the money Not worth the money I'm returning,Negative

Flimsy Fell apart when trying to remove it from packaging,Negative
"Small Wristed People, ONLY! It seems so very strange to me that the company's that import jewelry havent gotten the word yet that American women's wrists are larger unless you are a small woman. When you place a stretchy bracelet on, it should move comfortably around and up and down the arm. No mark's should be left when trying it on and wearing for 5-7 minutes.",Negative
"Waste of time ordering I had thought it would be function too, bought these as a joke leading up to an actual gifting of an echo, but they are such poor quality I would be embarrassed to gift them. Returning them and won’t buy online again for a while.",Negative
"Tarnish Will Wear Off I loved the necklace, the way it turned out and the way it looked. I ordered in late February, It came by early March. By mid May the tarnish had completely worn off and my neck had a horrible reaction to it so I can’t really wear it anymore. This was only from moderate wear, taking it off before showers and bed. It’s kind is disappointing as it was my favorite necklace I’ve purchased",Negative
Broke Broke the second time I wore it.,Negative
Only received ONE when I ordered THREE!! I ordered 3 names and I only received one?!? Very disappointed!!,Negative
"Cheaply made for the price, large for lady wrist, I’m hoping it holds up. It seems cheaply made for the price. I hope it is natural amethyst but honestly it doesn’t look it. It is large for a woman’s wrist, even on the tightest clasp it is very loose. Packaging was very cheap as you can see. So if you intend it for a gift, plan on buying a separate box to give it in.",Negative

Started peeling within an hour Prepped my walls and had a fairly easy time sticking them on.. It looked awesome - then an hour later I come back into the room and see every last one of the stickers peeling off.. I stick them back on - several more times throughout the next hour.. They refuse to stay on : ( I end up pulling them down and asking for a refund.. I don't receive a full refund and am out $10 of the $65 I paid.. Not happy..,Negative
Not what I was expecting Quality is fine. I was hoping the gradient would be 90° from where it was actually printed. Makes this product unusable for my project. :(,Negative

"Cute, but NOT sterling silver. So, I really love the styling of this ring.  And I was really excited to wear it, as the majority of the jewelry I wear on the daily is Sterling Silver. Real, 925 stamped, Sterling Silver.  This is not 925 sterling silver and should not be advertised as “sterling silver.”  It should be advertised as just a silver colored metal ring.  As you can see in the photo, the ring tarnished after wearing it one day. And, you can see that I am also wearing a Pandora bracelet, which I rarely take off.  I have never reacted to the Pandora bracelet or any other Sterling Silver jewelry that I wear daily.  The ring is very lightweight, which wasn’t a huge dealbreaker for me.  But false advertisement is a dealbreaker for me.  It’s really too bad, because it is a cute ring.  I’d have purchased more of these as gifts for friends. This was a first and last purchase for me.",Negative
"Not the same as the picture Great idea, wanted to like it, but it doesn't look as it does in person. The lips and mouth look huge, so it doesn't look right. Almost like something you would wear for Halloween since the lips and smile don't look natural, and are overly huge.",Negative
Not worth the money. Both earrings broke after wearing them for 3 days.,Negative

"Masks are made upside down. For correct fit remove wire and wear design on left cheek Love to support small business. I am a sewer and a pattern maker. Although these are beautiful designs, I was disappointed when they arrived. The masks are sewn upside down. This is a common mistake with masks patterns. People don’t know the top from the bottom. The maker needs to switch the pattern around. If you fold the mask in half and touch the ear parts together you can see along the food which part is intended for the nose. The deeper curvature is intended to fit the nose (the biggest part of the face). While the flatter part is for the lips. The maker sewed the nose wire in the side intended for the lips not the nose. They may have designed the floral pattern on the right cheek but the fit is wrong. The correct fit for the sewing pattern they used is intended for the floral pattern to fit on the left cheek. It is unfortunate that the maker does not know how to correctly fit masks to the face. Hopefully the maker reads this and corrects the make of these beautiful masks.",Negative

Poor quality :( Loved this but it turned gross and almost rusty within a few months. Made my nose very irritated.,Negative

"Surprisingly cheap I thought this would be like a poster or good quality paper Nope. It's literally a print on photo paper. Looks like someone did it off their computer.

Not as advertised Don’t buy If you are expecting the stickers to look like the advertisement.

Poor quality Fran broken and canvas is torn,Negative
A little disappointed The shirt has great quality however the logo print is crooked and the shipping took forever.  I understand there are unforeseen impacts due to the Covid-19 but the label was created and I received a shipment notification over a week before the item was actually shipped out.  The seller did explain they've been behind but I was even more disappointed the logo wasnt put on very well upon receiving it today.  The shirt also looks like it runs small so I would size up if you consider ordering.,Negative

"Not quite what is pictured . . . Unlike the earlier reviews, my purchase came in a brown paper bag and not a cute bag that you could use to pack the slippers in when traveling. The shape is much less defined than in the photos, they aren't particularly comfortable (the heel is quite loose), the felt isn't consistent in thickness and the soles are black rather than matched to the slipper color as in the photos. I'm quite disappointed. I expect more for a $100 pair of slippers.",Negative

"Cheap vinyl-waste of money I bought this for my daughter’s room. I am very disappointed in the quality of the vinyl. It is cheap and thin and the adhesive on the back is almost non-existent. I have done vinyl crafts many times before and know the key is to work slowly. I spent an hour and a half trying to put this on the wall. The transfer paper was very sticky and it stretched and tore the vinyl as I peeled it off a millimeter at a time. Now the letters are distorted, the dragon is torn in multiple places and it’s already falling off the wall. I doubt it will still be there tomorrow morning. Don’t buy this product!",Negative
"“Diamond” missing I was so excited to get this and now there will be no time to get a replacement. So sad that this wasn’t checked before it was mailed out. Very poor quality control, it’s already way overpriced. I would have been happy nonetheless had there not been an obvious defect!!!",Negative

Not worth the money. don’t overlook the description I should have read the description better so that’s my fault.<br />However to charge someone this much money for only a poster 8x10 print and no frame that’s ridiculous<br />1 photo paper by itself isn’t that expensive<br />2 ink per paper isn’t that expensive<br />3 you can go to the dollar store and get a frame or order them in bulk especially if your running a business.<br />4 cute picture and is going in my bathroom<br /><br />This would just look so much better if it were painted on a piece of wood and more rustic rather than a glossed photo paper.<br />Now I have to find a frame.<br />It’s just a little much. Now satisfied,Negative
Have no idea what kind of metal these are but they kill my ears and my ears are not sensitive They kill my ears!,Negative

"Worn once, stone fell off It’s definitely cute but not worth it when it looses a stone after wearing it once for a few hours. Not worth the money",Negative
"Very uncomfortable The strap itself is very good looking.  I got several of these, the other two had velcro closures and this is a slip-on.  Within about an hour of wearing it on my ankle it was very uncomfortable.  Because there's no velcro to adjust the looseness, it rubbed my ankle a lot.  As someone had said, you won't get any sleep measurements with this cover, so will have to remove it from its pouch (takes 10 minutes to get it in the pouch and about 5 minutes to get it out) each night and put the watch on a wrist band to measure sleep.  It does a great job at measuring steps, but the discomfort on my ankle isn't worth it.  Suggest getting a velcro closure instead.  It is very pretty, though.",Negative

The video online is subpar because she only shows a limited amount of the steps and personally when I got my kit the outline of it was so light that it was so hard to follow that I ended up putting it away for over a month now, it’s not easy it’s not a beginner course and if you make a mistake and try and pull the felt back out you lose the line that are drawn supposedly into the mat and you don’t know what you’re supposed to do anymore. this was a large amount of money to put away for this kid and I’m just not happy with it.",Negative
For small place needs matt in frame These pictures are okay they are small so you will need a mat inside a frame to make them of any size they're good in a small area like a bathroom or an entrance way other than that to use as any kind of Decor they're pretty useless. I thought they would be of a higher quality rather than just a print out on glass paper. I still haven't found a place to hang them yet but I haven't returned them because I do like the pictures themselves. Hope this helps,Negative
"too small very dissapointed in the size. very small, more like a mini pierogie",Negative

"One Star Didn't realize I went over 25, so now I have an ornament signed with 1 1/2 names.",Negative
No sizing options. They are a little too narrow and long for my ears so they don’t stay in place very well and pinch my ear lobes.,Negative
Could have covered my entire face. This mask was much too large. I am not smaller than average but this mask was WAY larger than average. I could have covered my entire face from hairline over my chin. It seemed to be just one large piece of fabric with no facial contours for a better fit.,Negative
Don’t buy…. I disliked it because it’s absolute hideous…I didn’t have to buy it to know that!!!,Negative
"Not exactly like pictured. Very cheap looking. The earrings were close but not exactly like pictured. They are a very shinny silver metal base. The picture of Mickey is not sharp/clear with a plastic rounded bubble covering over the picture of Mickey. There is no border around the circle. To me, they were very cheap looking. I was going to return them by the seller required that I pay shipping to return them. I already paid the shipping to get them. Very disappointed, what a waste of money.",Negative
Not what expected Does not look anything like the shark in the picture. Pretty disappointed with this sticker.,Negative
Stay away from this one! Smell was gone in less than an hour. Was greatly disappointed!,Negative
"One Star Darker than I expected, the quality was low grade. I wouldn't buy these again.",Negative
You get what you pay for What the title says. One is kinda pretty. One is a chunk of brown dirt some hints of purple in it. I’m thinking about returning these. I didn’t expect them to look as good as the photo but come on. Really?<br /><br />It was packaged well & they seem sturdy.,Negative
What? This is a joke right? Seriously? What's it made of? The ashes of Christ?,Negative
Didn’t work out. Barely any pressure to try and tighten it a little (twisting rather than pinching like the directions stated) and it immediately bent to where it was no longer rounded and it’s not possible to fix it after that. . Hard to see in the picture but there’s an obvious sharp bend once it’s on and I’ve tried everything to round it out.. $10 thrown away unfortunately,Negative
Weren’t what I expected These are basically shrinks dink’s with posts glued to them.,Negative
"Poor quality, construction Both shelves have terrible groves in them created when the wood was cut or sanded - and with the staining, were very noticeable. Then after measuring (instructions do not have measurements), the shelves do not stay on - they hang and are terribly flimsy. There's nothing to secure them. As I pulled one off, a metal bracket broke. Plus, both pieces are not the same size and since I'm stacking them, it's noticeable.<br /><br />I had to buy brackets to secure to the shelf and wall, and that's the only way I was able to firmly secure this on the wall. That means I only used the wood which is something I could have done from the start.",Negative
Not as pictured Colors were not as bright and colorful as pictured,Negative
"Pretty, but not wearable They are very pretty, but they do not clasp shut. I am unable to wear them, as they will not stay in my ears.",Negative
"Flimsy These are not for deep tangles in the beard. Make sure to detangle your beard with deep moisturizing treatment or conditioner, for a soft smooth feel and ease of combing. The quality is very cheep.",Negative
One Star Disappointed in every respect. Looks cheap. Poor workmanship.,Negative
"The design of this earring is adorable. However The design of this earring is adorable.  However, the description made it seem like it would be comfortable to wear 24/7.

Now I know to just get a round hoop that can move freely in all directions.",Negative

This is only an actual 8 x 10 picture that you need to put in a frame! I didn’t realize this was only a picture of the sign and not an actual wooden sign so it feels like a rip off!,Negative
Belly ring Received three belly rings but none that matched my order of an Opal turtle.,Negative

Not worth the money!! This bag is so cheaply made. Plastic with some cheap material. Don't waste your money. It's so small and can't fit anything in it. What a waste of money!!,Negative
Don't buy The font is so small it cannot be read. it looks as if it's just a bar I'm wearing.  Honestly I don't wear it,Negative
Feels like switch and bait on the quality It feels like switch and bait honestly and poor quality of the stones and just looks plain nothing mysthical or life or spiritual. More like throw in the left over crap and put a metal wired on it and sell it at high price.,Negative
"Quality of the Item The first tags we ordered were excellent...very high quality and nice job on the initials. When I ordered a set for my wife, she only wanted a single initial since her first and last name start with the same letter. When they arrived, the letter T was barely visible. I complained to the company that the size of the single letter was smaller than my tags with 3 letters. There response was...that's the largest size letter we have available and adding my paraphrasing...sorry you don't like it, but you're stuck with it since we don't accept returns regardless of whether you're satisfied or not. Amazon's A to Z return policy also exempts this product?!?",Negative

"Save your money! I originally bought two. One broke because it’s extremely fragile. Order another one & that arrived in pieces. Packaging that it was shipped in was a shipping envelope and the sign was wrapped in one layer of thin bubble wrap. This should have been shipped in a box, given how easily they break.",Negative
Wasted money Was expecting an actual sign not a piece of paper. Never again,Negative
"Contains misspellings. While it would seemingly be a nice gift, the misspelling makes it clearly obvious that it is the work of a careless amateur. This is also something you could do yourself with colored paper and a laser printer. It's a nice idea, but it is certainly not worth the money.",Negative
Nice product but It's Bend :( The product looks very good. It's modern and the material looks like a good quality.<br />The problem was that it came bend. That's why my qualification is 1 star.,Negative
One Star Can't get them on.,Negative
"Pay attention to the size!!!! The product is very nice, the print is exactly how it’s pictured. BUT make sure you look at how big it is!!! This is an 8x10 very small!!

You could print this out in photo paper yourself instead of spending $12 on a “poster” that’s printed in photo paper…",Negative
"Too small Very small and tiny, wish I would have investigated this more.",Negative
Zero rhinestones This is a $25 headband that is supposed to have rhinestones. And there is not one rhinestone on here. It’s merely a piece of fabric with silver on it. If I could give zero stars I would. Of course I’m going to return this because there’s no way $25 is going to fly. I wouldn’t pay five dollars for this.,Negative
Nice accent Maybe I missed something but the first letter is lowercase :( other than that love how it looks! This product sticks to the wall the way it should!!!,Negative
"Cute Earrings But Cheaply Made These earrings are cute and lightweight, but smaller than depicted. Furthermore, the post was hard to open and it broke off the first time.",Negative
"Only paper, no frame The poster is advertised in a frame, I just found out that the frame is not included. I paid $22 for a 11x14 sheet of paper. Not worth it at all. There should be better communication that the product is NOT as advertised.",Negative
Disappointed The edges seem rough and not very well made,Negative
Not worth your money It took so long to come and I couldn't use it but it was too small anyway. Very disappointed I could have got a bigger one for the same price at party city. I know better next time,Negative
Not for Sensitive Noses The “paint” rubbed off and gave me an infection. Do not buy if you have sensitive skin!!,Negative
"Needs better chain I’ve now purchased this on two separate occasions. Nothing rough or outside of normal wear, but the chain is so delicate. Each time, the chain has broken (not the clasp, the actual chain). The Hamsa charm is so small you’ll be hard pressed to find a replacement chain or swap it out upon receipt. Just be aware.",Negative
Too small. Made to fit a child size chair. Trashed. Did not meet my needs at all.,Negative
One Star Much smaller than realized for the price!,Negative
scratchy. Doesn't close all the way I could not wear this. Couldn't get it to stay in comfortably. Be aware this is not a hoop that closes. I needed a replacement since I broke my nose stud and can't get into and piercing place right now. I put this nose ring in my jewelry box and put and earring in my nose instead. would not buy again,Negative
beyond disappointing🤦 Worst purchase i have EVER made on Amazon...Definitely NOT value for money....total ripoff!!!,Negative
Cheap Cheap,Negative
Picture well fool you This product is not painted gold. It is unpainted boring wood. If you aren’t crafty or you just don’t want to do the work it takes to paint it…do not order this product.  There’s no way you can gift this to someone at least I wouldn’t. It’s an unfinished craft which is quite disappointing.,Negative
Need replacement Decal missing part of the A and screw,Negative
Cute but color was off... I loved the idea of the ring and it fit perfectly just what I wanted however it was way off in color. The gold was too orange looking for my taste.,Negative
Beautiful pearls but it broke after the first use.  I will have to restring.  ,Negative
Lasted 2 days At first I thought these were some decent decals. After 1 truck wash and 2 days of driving they peeled right off.,Negative
I'm very disappointed with the poor quality of this frame I'm very disappointed with the poor quality of this frame. There is glue seeping out of the corners of the frame. The corners are not flush. There are bubbles in the frame which give away that the frame is definitely not solid wood. There is a scratch in the frame.The engraved part is poorly done. The O is not round. There must be ZERO quality control done by this vendor.,Negative

Decals wrong Decal was backwards. Can’t use,Negative
does not stamp so well This stamp did not do as I expected.  The raised lines on the stamp are not profound enough to leave a good mark.  If I press down to soft I dont get a good stamp and if I press too hard you can read the letters or numbers properly.,Negative
Not what i thought My daughter plays softball and i got these for the coaches and i was extremely disappointed when i received it. I didnt realize i paid what i paid for a print out. I could of made this myself for way less.,Negative
Paint comes off easily. Very cute shoes BUT the color cracked in multiple areas the first week. For over $200.00....I would never buy these again.,Negative
"Disappointing This name tag is so rigid, it is completely inflexible, making it basically impossible to place on a stethoscope as advertised. By removing an ear bud, I could slide the name tag only through the metal section of my steth - it stops at the tubing and won’t go any further. This is the least effective way to tag a stethoscope - as soon as someone removes an ear bud, it will take &lt;1 second to slide out this name tag. Not worth it.",Negative
"Piece of Junk This is poorly constructed and EVERYTHING is made of plastic. One would thing, at least, the engraved beads would be metal. It’s cheaply made and overpriced. Extremely disappointed.",Negative
Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the ... Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small.

The chain was very nice though.,Negative
"Do not buy this product It’s super cute and dainty, but i had the worst reaction to it. I’ve never had an issue with different metals, but it caused my piercing to bleed and was swollen and painful the week I had it in. I had to cut it out of my nose to get it out. Would definitely not recommend this product.",Negative
I am very disappointed Is not a quality product,Negative

"Biggest scam ever, LOL Scam. Absolute scam. There’s a reason it’s ranked 17,800. Don’t buy. “Hand Made.” Wrapped a wire around a tube, cut a bunch of them off, put them in a box. You’ll look like a 12 year old. Unless you are a 12 year old you need to stop spending your moms money.",Negative

Cheap and one sided don’t bother Very cheaply made and the one sided earring wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t turn around and show the back side.  Offered 20% restocking fee and I would pay shipping to return them.  They are in the trash now,Negative
"Pretty Disappointed!@#$%& Bought this item for my wife's Bday. I love the idea but...<br /> I was very displeased with quality. The frame is a ""laminated"" to make it look like wood frame. Glass hides the ""paper printed picture"" $60 was a little steep for such a small picture size. I would have over looked the size had the quality no looked and felt so cheap.<br />Again great idea but failed on the quality... this husband failed to deliver on this one",Negative

It didn't stay on my wrist properly when I first started wearing it. I constantly had to adjust it and turn it around.  After a week of wearing it, the part of the bracelet that tightens and loosens it doesn't keep the bracelet snug.  It comes undone and I now I have to constantly keep tightening the bracelet because it keeps falling off. The roping pattern that's used isn't working out too well.

Misleading I received bunny soaps only - very misleading post.,Negative
Dont but from this company It was completely disappointing. The girth could only handle one cord. I was hoping to put the speaker wires and DVR cord along side of the tv cord. It was not as long as it stated. I had to go with a diffrent company and there's worked out they way I planned it.,Negative
"Junk The backing did not want to come off and when it did it would tear the decal so badly that is unusable. Very disappointed in product and when I notified the supplier, they would not respond to my message.",Negative
"WASTE OF MONEY This thing is barely bigger than a quarter, and is about as thin.  The back is scuffed and not smooth like I was hoping.<br /><br />DO NOT waste your money on this item!  Cthulhu is NOT appeased by this measly piece of garbage!",Negative
"Again, not pleased (sad face) I was hoping that this would feel authentic. I am very disappointed with the quality. I feel like this necklace is a toy, and will probably send it to my 7 year old grand daughter. I don't even know if the resin actually contains real gem stones. I would not recommend this necklace to anyone. Yes, it would make a good gift to a kid, but not an adult.",Negative
Don't waste your money This items honestly a piece of junk the stone is not even mounted to the back plate which it's actually kind of looks like it would be the writing is so pathetic I can't even read the name that I had put on there don't waste your money this is really a waste very disappointed not even giving the gift to the person I purchased it for,Negative

"Very cheap, not worth price, will probably only last one use. I had very high hopes that the cost would match the produce, these are very very cheap. Flat metal glued onto wood dipped in green paint with clear coat. The pick makes them look so much more worth it. I do not recommend at all unless maybe for one time use. Very disappointed considering the price. Should only cost 2$ ....",Negative
"I really wanted to love these earrings! I was really looking forward to these earrings. I had been trying to mind something minimalist, so when I saw them I though, PERFECT! When they arrived I realized they only come with one pair not two. (Which was my own fault for not reading more carefully and assuming based on the picture used.)<br />When they arrived I realized they are not nearly as cute as in the picture. The earring back itself is very cheap and it pinches and rolls easily when putting them on, and doesn’t want to come off.<br />The earrings themselves don’t match. One is smooth and shiny like the picture. The other looks like a hammered nail head. It’s even bent.<br />I wouldn’t recommend these earrings.",Negative
These puzzles are very flimsy and the wood on one has marks. I This is poorly made and very flimsy.  One I ordered had wood that is inconsistently stained.  I would like to know if it is returnable as it is not gift quality.,Negative

"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!!!👎👎👎 It was nothing like the picture, it was super small, very thin and it looks like somebody made it from a bottle top. For $40.00+ dollars including shipping I expected more quality, not worth it, I rarely give bad reviews but this was a slap in the face.👎👎👎",Negative
"NOT SURE IF MINE CAME FROM THIS BUSINESS When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with ""Our Anniversary""  [our names] and  [date]  with  ""25 years  and Counting"".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  ""Magnetic"" pages is just a new name for old school ""press & stick"" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.",Negative
rust in my ears loved these at first but after about a week they began to rust and deteriorate in my ears.,Negative
"A fine slime, but it could use some help........ This was A fine slime, but it could use some help. It could not come out of the container, but it was not sticky! It also left a strange residue on my hand. So I re-activated it and it still had the same texture! I could have spent my money on something else!",Negative
Check the size before buying Shame on me for not paying attention to the size before I bought it. If this poor kid uses this bag for trick or treating we will be done in 10 minutes. VERY SMALL,Negative
"Return policy After receiving this item, I found the charms were attached to the necklace and I wanted to put them onto another chain.  Upon getting the return ""approved"" I found that the price to ship them back was nearly the cost of the charms.<br /><br />I would not recommend this company.",Negative
"Misleading Photos. The product is only the little cloth face mask, not the larger mask shown in each and every photo. Admittedly, I should have figured this out based on the low price, but still, it's misleading at best and deceptive at worst. I do appreciate how easy it was to cancel this order.",Negative
"So gorgeous!! These are beautiful. The sterling silver that I got is flexible but they hold their shape. Only problem is that my earlobes are thicker than the curve of the earring so I actually reshaped mine with pliers. I adore them to much and I get compliments on them every single day I'm out and about.<br /><br />Edit: Had them for months, first time it's been out of my ear, buying another set!",Negative
Didn’t last long Broke the first time I wore it,Negative
Necklace broke after 5 days. Broke on me in 5 days. The loop connecting the lobster clasp is very delicate and breaks with minimal pressure. Not worth 20 bucks at all.<br /><br />Please read my warning do not buy.,Negative
Not actually a sign Misleading product title!!!<br />I bought this “sign” as a gift for a friend who’s been the hospital for over a month.!When I received it I was a little disappointed to see that it was actually just a photo and not a sign. I ended up having to purchase a frame to put it in which is fine but not what I intended on.  If they didn’t advertise this a sign I would've read more about it. Since I was looking for an actual sign (typically made of metal or sometimes plastic) I probably would not have bought it,Negative
Beaded Bracelet didn’t last I really enjoyed the look of the bracelets but was disappointed when the beaded one broke within a week of buying it. :(,Negative
"not at all like pictured! Appears to be just laser cut sheet metal, rough edges. no finish at all",Negative

"Painful Infection I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.",Negative
"Too short😤 The quality was very good - thick & the fact that it could be personalize, is a bonus. I ordered 2 for my brother & his wife. Unfortunately, it was very short. It would not even fit my neck and I have an almost thin neck. So, what's the use of a good craftsmanship if you can't wear it? Too bad, I could have bought more as a 🎁 since many were asking me where I got my leather lanyard (from another company).",Negative
One Star very disappointed.  appear cheap.  very lightweight.  I am returning .,Negative
One Star Just a piece of paper.,Negative
Don’t waste your money The most disappointing purchased I’ve made in my life. These are printed on glittery stock papers not even white like the picture advertised. There’s weird splatter spots on it too. Don’t waste your money. I’m sure printing it yourself would turn out even better.,Negative
Not good. It either sticks or it doesn't. I give up.,Negative
"Sliced my son’s finger open on rough edges This is not a toy, it cut my son’s finger open.  I bought this for my son’s 2nd birthday to help him learn the letters in his name.  It is nice looking but not a toy to play with.  The letters are not sanded down and they are rough.  The “t” is stuck and not able to be removed.  The sharp edges sliced my son’s finger open within a couple seconds of playing with it.  I do not recommend.",Negative

"Tiny, puny, overpriced...bad decision! Avoid unless you like small stuff! The amulet was way smaller than I expected. I probably should have looked deeper into the product description but I thought for the price, it would have to be a reasonable size....I was wrong and it was puny! I started the return process and was told by the company that it was going to cost about $10 to return and after everything was all boxed up , I was charged $27 to return it! I was disgusted and frankly, rather angry. I’ve never been so disappointed by a product that I bought from amazon...especially something that I purchased as a relic of my personal beliefs. If I could give less than one star, I would.",Negative
Disappointed Ordered thinking it would be on a spool as pictured.  Item description doesn’t say that the spool isn’t included anywhere until you go to “see more” section of the description.  Disappointing and rather expensive not to receive as pictured.,Negative

"Absolutely Disappointed! This was the biggest rip off I’ve ever received off of amazon! The wreath is actually built on a 6 inch frame. It is smaller then my dinner plate. It came with many rotten, smashed eucalyptus sprigs and miss shaped as well. Very upsetting as I was looking so forward to receiving my wreath. 😡",Negative
"Great idea but the letters peel after 2 weeks. Love the idea. But the lettering doesn’t last. I received my case on Jan 4th. And it looks great. Loved it. Got so many compliments. But as of today, Jan. 15th, my name (Lisa gM) is not legible. Not happy. I use my watch edgy day so I’m not holding my phone often. I’m thinking if the lettering would sit on the inside of the case instead of the outside . It may have lasted a bit longer. I’m searching for another personalized case.",Negative
JUNK!!!!! Purchased this as a gift.. it literally broke within one hour of my daughter wearing it!  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Negative
Peels off easily. Hard to install I love the graphic but it has so many tiny cut outs that it’s hard to put on. The clear film is so stuck on the vinyl that when you try to peel it off the whole decal starts coming off. It was frustrating and I ended up removing it and damaging the vinyl. Wasted my money.,Negative

Forget wearing it to work for hours and hours!  Guess I'll keep double masking...",Negative

This slime was completely hardened and ruined upon arrival Not happy. Will not be purchasing again,Negative
Screen print is too thin Front of shirt is great. The image is nice and has an even print. The personalized name on the back is almost see-through screen print - not evenly painted- and doesn’t match the front. It looks cheaply added. Would not purchase again.,Negative

Not worth the money Definitely not worth the money not what I expected. Very small not happy.,Negative
"Don't buy it The picture is nice and was delivered on time. But the quality sucks!!!<br />I paid almost $50 for a laminated piece of thin paper. I mean... at least use thick laminate, nope... that's thin too so it easily rips.<br />The grommets are loose and 2 fell off while unrolling the banner which means hanging it from the holes with string rips the corners.  Now I have to tack it to the wall somewhere and it won't be the Center piece.<br />So... I drove from the post office straight to Costco and printed a banner for half the price and better quality than this.<br />Don't buy it!",Negative
"Picture of a picture Cute saying, but the product looks like a picture of a picture. Defyingly not worth the money paid for it<br /> Bought it for a present for someone and it as really tacky looking",Negative

"Not the same formula I first tried Mojo products on a trip to Chicago with my sisters in January 2020. (Before things fell apart with pandemic) With my last batch and I literally told everyone I know it was the best eye cream ever. This new one I bought (off Amazon for ease) is not the same as my old one I just used up. The container is smaller, the formula has a more yellow tint, it is “harder” in the container and does not go on as smooth. So disappointed as I feel like I need to find a different eye cream now. I won’t be buying more from Mojo.",Negative
Bad design These come with stoppers for the back but they keep falling out from the front because the front hammered part is so narrow. I won’t wear them out because I know I’d lose them.,Negative
"Useless. Waste of money Not only did this come severely damaged, but of course we didn't notice the cracks until we washed it.

Vinyl came very WRINKLED and DISCOLORED! This was a MESS!!! It came wrinkled and UGLY. OMGOODNESS. The RED in that flag is ORANGE. I will be too damn embarrassed to take that to my son’s graduation from Boot Camp. They’re going to be wondering what flag that is because it’s ORANGE. Don’t waste your money. See if WAL-GREENS have something like it.,Negative

"Thin and Flimsy There's a similar appearing item on etsy that is much more substantial for only $5 more, a very high quality and structured bag. This bag is a very thin and flimsy very basic canvas tote with a zipper top and the pocket organizer is tiny compared to the bag so its more like another random item tossed in than anything helpful. The embroidery is nice though, unfortunately however that makes it unreturnable.",Negative

Couldn’t even order the product because they have an option for font that wasn’t define enough I tried to order a custom Logo patch for my lab coat and it’s just not customer friendly he wanted me to pick a font But wouldn’t take any fun suggest of the style I want it it just kept saying missing field.<br />I’m very annoyed I spent an hour trying to figure it out it shouldn’t be that hard.  I won’t be able to do business with this company and I feel like it would’ve been nice had the order process went more smoother,Negative
Buyer beware of size. So cute but plot this out on the wall before you buy.  My mistake but can't return.  Looks like a post-it note where I wanted it.,Negative

"Sensitive skin 👎 I really do not like writing bad reviews, but these earrings were not it for me. They irritated my ears badly (but I do have very sensitive skin) and I cannot wear them anymore. I am not sure if I put them in wrong and closed them wrong when they were in my ears but the little opening always got stuck inside my ear. I was very hopeful but they did not work out for me. I would say that if you have sensitive ears, do not buy these.",Negative

"Looks Used and Cheao This item looked like it had already been used and was very junky looking. The gold was missing in several areas and black was showing through. The package, which I did not bother opening, was chewed up and had holes in it. I ordered it for a party and even though it said overnight delivery, it wasn’t shipped until a couple days later. It did not arrive in time so I had to order something else. Sort of glad it happened that way though because the bracelets I ended up using were much nicer than this one.",Negative

"Definitely not a plaque, more like an ornament In the title of this item it should include the word “MINI” as we opened the package and it’s not at all what we expected. When it said “plaque” we expected it to be 7 or 8 inches big, not the 3 inches it turned out to be.",Negative

Too small It's too small to even fit a nose. Good for kids. Not for adults.,Negative
crappy product crappy product and not worth the price.,Negative
Not anything I would frame You can literally print this on your own computer printer and have the same exact results except it would probably not be dented like mine was. Definitely NOT worth $15,Negative
"It came pretty fast however quality is better than a speedy delivery!!!!!! I followed the directions all the way however the decal isn't sticking at all I had to put tape on the back of it. The unicorn especially was in need of tape to make it stay. I would have returned and still may, but my daughter loves it nonetheless. I wouldn't buy this product ever again especially since I spent the highest amount because I needed for it to be really big over her bed. I am totally dissatisfied with this product. I received a different name decal from another company and it was great no problems at all.",Negative
"Poor quality This print was received as a wedding gift and while the thought was nice, the quality of the print could be better. The print is really dark and has no contrast and for $30 and personalized, I would expect better quality.<br /><br />Be sure you don't misspell either...one simple transpose of a letter and the company will not work with you. No return calls made, they expect you to purchase a new one and may offer 25% refund if you fight.<br /><br />Another disappointing factor is this print isn't available on their website, on here on Amazon. We aren't going to ask the person who gifted to buy a new one, nor do we feel the need to give them more money.<br /><br />If the print quality was better as well as CS, we would would have.",Negative

No scent Arrived early put in my melter no smell was excited for this smell like bathd body but no smell hard for me to shop as i am disabled  disappointed,Negative
"I went for a more expensive one and that was a mistake I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.",Negative
"Not my favorite It might just be me, but I really didn’t enjoy this. It feels very cheap and doesn’t do much to help with my picking issues. It doesn’t pick easily at all and the materials are just not really great. I really wanted to like this. It’s a great idea, but the quality could be better.",Negative
NASA would be ashamed Horrible. Cheap looking. Definitely not what is pictured. Don’t waste your money.,Negative
"NOT WORTH IT! I’m honestly at lost for words.. it came in the mail yesterday (3/26/22), I washed it ASAP because I was wanting to wear it TODAY (3/27/22).. get it out of the dryer and the words are already coming off??? I just got this shirt not even 24 hours ago… I’m not going through the hassle of arguing over returning the shirt and getting another one made so I’ll just be getting the shirt made somewhere else. So frustrated considering I paid a total of $26.26. AND it arrived late.<br /><br />On the bright side, they put it in a cute watermelon package 😂",Negative
Bracelet for woman/man? Very attractive but no stretch to it so it is very tight on a man.,Negative

tipped over and broke immediately. This thing was tipped over and broke immediately. I have other glasses just like it. I've knocked them over and they survived.,Negative
Not what I expected It’s a beautiful earring but very thin. I was able to wear them twice and afterwards it broke at the back. I contacted the seller to reorder or rectify this order without success. Never heard back from them. If they were made a little thicker and stronger they would have been perfect. Again only got to wear them twice. I don’t sleep in my earrings either.,Negative

"Don’t waste your money This piece of glass looks like a chunk off the bottom of a colored glass bottle.  It doesn’t look like sea glass at all.  It’s clunky and not pretty.

Smelly but not in a good way Has an odd smell reminiscent of burnt snuff (old fashioned ground powdered tobacco) 🫤,Negative
Awful Very small,Negative
Beautiful but secure the stone Love the look of this ring. It LOOKS like it has some weight to it. It doesn’t. Very lightweight which is okay. Main problem was the aquamarine stone. Apparently was glued into place and not with anything strong? I guess what would’ve helped is if they had extended the casing up and over the edges of the stone to secure it in place. Was so sad when it fell off a few hours after I started wearing it and o couldn’t find the stone. If I’d found it I would’ve used something to reattach since I love the look of this ring so much. Unfortunately couldn’t  find the stone and can’t afford to blow off $126 so I had to return. 🥲,Negative
I didn't get what I expected. The size is for a newborn at best! [[VIDEOID:d872d30cea1f7524e2fa931828c218d3]] I was totally mislead 😕 The bracelet is not for adults. MAYBE for a newborn at best.,Negative
"it is a beautiful piece of jewelry I bought my Silver Metal Band in June 30, 2017. I was so excited when I reveived it. I got so much complements on it, it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. After wearing it for just a few months the charm discolored, that was a big disappointment. I changed the band. When I went back to use the Silver Metal Band the latch didn't snap back on. Its no good. I couldn't believe it. I probably use it for about 5 months, once I removed it that was it. I haven't been able to use it :/",Negative
It looks nice but less than a month having it the blue ... It looks nice but less than a month having it the blue started coming off and sticking to my skin.

I had it made as a gift for my sister in law. I contacted the seller about this. I spent close to $45 including shipping (mind you seller and I are in the same state) and seller wrote back she would refund me IF I purchased another robe and she would try and place the writing in a more blank spot, due to the cut of the floral fabric. In less than 24hrs she closed the Amazon case before I was able to situate this issue. It should be stated that writing and floral cut is not guaranteed to be the same. It makes a big difference when the wording is directly through the flowers and in the same color as the flowers...",Negative

Defective. No response to two enquiries. I reached out when ours arrived crooked.

No place to tell them I don’t want there tool images The picture says it all. There was no place for me to give them directions that I did not want their tool icons or images on my sign. So I took a chance thinking that somebody would have the forethought not to put the tools on a no diving sign. I would return the damn thing but I needed it for insurance purposes. Somebody needs to pull their head out of their bottom and think about their customers needs! Who in the hell would want wrenches and screwdrivers on a simple sign that says no diving shallow.,Negative

Be more impractical as they are not even solidly attached to each other to make one cohesive piece (They have made '8 inch' out of a 6 inch and 2 inch which are somehow not solidly attached but physically come apart).  The stain is orangey and I don't think the wood is reclaimed or industrial in feel, though it is real.  I hate the edge.  I hate it all.  I was denied a refund and have had this sitting on various floors throughout the house for 5 months since I purchased it.  I have lost the mounting hardware...  I am finally going to claim defeat and hang in on a back wall behind the door of my son's room with brackets.  Might change it to 2 stars at that point if I'm lucky.  Buyer beware and buyer be sure!",Negative
Disappointed I received one bar of soap when the picture depicted 3. It should have been clearer if there is only one bar for the price point. The soap itself looked strange. I've bought handmade soap before and I guess I was expecting something similar. I sent it back because I wouldn't pay $6 for one bar of soap (especially when I was expecting 3).,Negative
Not my order I didn’t purchase anything like this,Negative
Junk THIS IS NOT STERLING SILVER!! It’s plastic!! I was extremely disappointed being that I paid $20 for it!,Negative

"Dissapointed Love the print, had to have it. Wish I saved my cash. The t-shirt itself is super thin and shrunk alot. I wouldn't even care if it was a 10 dollar fair t-shirt, but at 27 bucks I expect a little bit more.",Negative
cheaply made So I got the cup and it was great at first. It does change color like it says. BUT then I started using it and had to wash the cup. The lettering on the cup lasted through 2 washes and came off. You can still see the outline of the letters on the cup but all the glitter and sparkles are gone. I would not recommend buying this unless you plan on not washing it....which is gross!,Negative
"They just don't last They don't last. The rubber inside that the post sticks into always streches out and the posts don't stay in. Also, the tips break off.<br /><br />They are my favorite style of faux gages, though. Just wish they were better made.",Negative
Misleading product This item is literally a cheap plain face plate with decorative tape on it. I’m so annoyed. Natural oils on fingers or hands that turn off and on the light will eventually cause this is discolor and fade. Complete let down,Negative
Tarnished within a week :( Looks great at first...took less than a week for charms to tarnish.  Waste of money. Loved it at first just needs to be better quality.,Negative
"Looks good but cheaply made I have to say, these cufflinks are large and look great. In fact they are the largest cufflinks i own.  These are attention grabbers.<br /><br />I wore them and got compliments throughout the morning. I went to lunch and felt my French cuffs.  Why? Well the lion head was gone.  It broke in less than one workday.  (Photo shows what's left of cufflink)<br /><br />Very flimsy and cheap.  SAD!",Negative

Broken within 3 or 4 days I ordered 2 of these necklaces. The one I received was very pretty but the chain broke within 3 or 4 days. I ordered another one for my granddaughter the first part of December and as of December 23 I still have not received. The company will replace the broken one but it’s not at my home it’s at my other granddaughters . It’s very pretty but cheaply made. IMO.,Negative
Was cracked inside and very cheap. waiting A long time for this and when it came was in bad shape Just looked old and beat up.,Negative
"Nice but creased and fuzzy I purchased these dandelion prints for baby’s playroom. Like most other reviewers, I agree that the right-sided picture (without the stems) appears fuzzy and digitized. The worst part is that both of these arrived with a crease, and since the paper has a sheen to it this is very noticeable in the frame. This seller should really package the item better to prevent creasing from happening. (I would return these prints, however I waited to put the prints in frames because the baby is still a few weeks away, and now the return window has closed.)",Negative

"Likely not sterling silver I really wanted to like this, and the seller seems to have a lot of cool items too, but I have a problem - the chain and latch are tarnished black and unlikely to be sterling silver.<br /><br />Gave 2 stars because I like the concept. The stone also didn’t come as pictured, more cracks and broken (since it’s one of a kind, I based my judgement on the picture provided)",Negative
"I like the product but cannot give it like this Please help, big crack thru the “9”, that travels across top of sign.

Broke in 48 hours The chain broke after one night of wearing it.,Negative
Paper frame I thought this picture would come in a photo frame. Not just paper frame. It is my fault I didn’t really read the description. If I knew this I wouldn’t of spend 25 dollars on it.  The picture is what I wanted but I think a frame should of been included.,Negative
Terribly priced product I am highly disappointed with this product. It is definitely not worth the $20 I paid. It's not even worth $10,Negative
Two Stars way too large decided to return,Negative

High school shop product! [[VIDEOID:3daddc53998b78a6cad3022e97a254ba]] Did not like anything about it! It’s made of a stiff cardboard. The only metal on this are the hands on front..oh no that’s plastic. Not worth it. If this was customized then it was done by a 10 year old. Going back ASAP,Negative
"Necklace got a lot of love, but it broke Necklace broke when putting on",Negative
Not good Please know that this is not a three dimensional manatee. The back of it is pen/hollow.  It doesn’t look realistic if you’re a manatee lover like me. Disappointed:(<br /><br />Update on 2/21/23:  The crystal came off now :(,Negative
POOR QUALITY DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY Terrible! The Recall Newsom sticker is literally TAPED on to a magnet. Magnet is not strong due to tape. Save your money and make your own. You can literally buy magnets that you don't have to apply tape too. There are magnets that allow for items to stick to them without tape. I'm highly disappointed in this.,Negative
"Lamented my lament puzzle box So mail delivery let's not get into but received box in the open position didn't think much of it, but after inspecting it, understand why sent that way, was made bad, unaligned and obviously as seen in first pic was damaged from before it was sent so can't close, had it been able to close I'd be ok with it, paint a little meh, just paid too much for it not to work properly",Negative
"Way too chunky to wear I should have read the comments, this thing doesn't quite look like the picture and is way too chunky to wear. The gems are on long metal posts that stick way out. I got this to match a rose gold necklace I purchased at the same time, but its too chunky and fake looking to wear.",Negative

Tarnished They were both so tarnished they were almost black,Negative
Magnets aren’t strong The magnets are very weak,Negative
"Disappointed I was excited for this new shirt. The day it arrived I washed it on a regular color cycle made sure to set my washer on cold water and the shirt came out like this! After a single wash the ink on the letters is faded now, it has weird stains and it stained other clothes that threw in with the shirt. Just disappointed with the quality.",Negative
"Relic from the Titanic. The bag itself seems of decent quality, but the buckles and zippers are tarnished so bad that they look like they have been stored under water.  I had to scrape white calcium like stuff from the metal.  Some cannot be removed.  &#34;Rustic&#34; is NOT the word I would use.",Negative
Smell does not last They need to improve the product so the smell last longer,Negative
Dunno what to do. Like the gem not the ring The gem was cute but the silver was completely oxidized and I dunno if it's old or new also no where it was marked as a 925 sterling silver.<br />I think I will return it.,Negative
"Not suitable for child under age 3 years This product was smaller than expected. Due to the size of the knobs on the letters, it is not suitable for a child aged 1 to 3 years as advertised.",Negative

"VERY POOR QUALITY This product is NOT worth what I paid for it.  DO NOT purchase a name board from this company.  The board that the letters fit in is VERY thin and will break VERY easily it's so thin.  The message that I paid extra for on the back of the board is also VERY poor quality.  Some of the letters are very visible and will fade.  I would not have chosen ANY STARS, but I had to choose at least one.  VERY DISSATISFIED!",Negative
Beware The butterfly part is pretty but the sticks to attach it looks like or is a painted pencil. Would not have bought it if  I realized that. With shipping costs does not pay to return it.,Negative
BIG DISAPPOINTMENT Wanted some wording for a birthday. The letters did not stick to the backdrop and was very fragile. Tore at the slightest tug. When asking about another set or some alternative option…was told it was my fault and nothing could be done. Will take my business elsewhere,Negative

Not good Not shani,Negative
"Flimsy I ordered 2 of these to decorate a cup for my mother and myself. I followed the directions to the letter, but part of the decal would stick and the other would try to pull off.

The second one went on but when I went to pick it up, the decal came right off.",Negative
"TOO BIG!!! This bracelet is supposed to be for a 10 year old girl. However, the circumference of it is almost 8 inches, which is way too big for a child. Very disappointed.",Negative
"Difficult to install The sticker while very detailed, has a large area that is not the actual sticker and it is very hard to line up on the window correctly.  It is SUPER sticky and if you don't get it placed correctly there is no way to reposition it without damaging the sticker.",Negative
Damaged and dirty These “photo prints” came torn and in an envelope that was so dirty and worn. Like it had been sitting on a shelf for years. I really want these and hope the seller made a mistake and will replace them. So sad as I love them.,Negative

"The hands are not attached well at all! Although the looks of this clock fit our decor theme well, the functionality is lacking in that the hands on this clock are not attached very well at all.  The minute hand fell off almost instantly!  We have jerry-rigged it to keep it going, but are strongly disappointed by it.",Negative
"cheap looking In the picture it looks like gold (like in the movie Neverending Story). However it's only wood. Then I went to return it, they charged for the UPS shipping which was almost the same price as the product. Definitely wouldn't order from them again.",Negative

Fragile I bought this originally for my mother after she was diagnosed and the first one broke within a couple weeks. They sent out a replacement easily enough but that one lasted less than a month before it too broke in the same way.,Negative
Still waiting for my refund The setting was beautiful but I prefer the lavender Tanzanite. Sent this back on March 24th and I’m still waiting for my refund.I reached out twice to the seller and have not heard back.,Negative
"Does not come framed Very cute but not worth the money, if you have a printer you can print this out yourself. It did come well packaged and arrived neat and crisp but I was shocked it did not come framed and it was a single sheet of photo paper. Not worth the money when you can print it yourself.",Negative
"Why you're losing sales Attention seller! Customers should be able to preview what the custom pendant will look like before they purchase. Also, why can't sides 2-4 be written horizontally? Only side one can be? Thats silly",Negative
Didn’t come when was suppose to Was almost 2 weeks later than shipping date. Received refund. When it did show was junk. Would not give as a gift. Would like to return or just throw away or let grandkids have in their toy pile,Negative

It's no Silpada 🙁 Looks & feels like tin,Negative
"Not worth the price-bad qualify For $60 I expected a little more durability. The 1 bys that were used were not all predrilled like instructions stated. Also sent with sheet rock screws not wood screws, also had plastic drywall anchors but no mounting screws only Sheetrock screws. Screws only allow for approximately 1/2 inch of screw into all portions of the wood including only 1/2in into the wall being mounted on. Do not recommend. Idea is awesome but not for $60.",Negative
"Waste of money !! Doesn’t stick and even sprayed shellac .. not happy !! No directions for metal only glass, but sold for mailbox",Negative
I wore it and it fell off the chord. It is pretty and the photos are true to the way that it appears but it is not sturdy at all for it to fall apart from the chord.,Negative

Pretty disappointed and would not purchase from this seller again.",Negative
"Unsealed wood that chips, paint that bleeds, falls off the backing and will get lost within a week This pin is made from wood, and the paint, especially the black, bleeds into the other colors. There is no sealant or shellac on the pin. This pin chipped within a week of having it. I filled the chip in with red sharpie and it seemed to look somewhat ok, but then it complexity broke off the actual pin and was lost.

Not Practical These are quite small. Only decorative. Not usual or useful wooden spoons.,Negative
Chain / cord very cheap. A piece of string basically The stones are beautiful and colorful but I was very disappointed in the cheap string. I would not give this as a gift until I replaced the string. It’s lightweight and value for the money is ok,Negative

"Tarnished overnight I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the product. I love the design and the sentiment, but not the material. I gave it as a gift to a good friend and the next day it was all tarnished. The chain looks terrible and like it has been worn for months when in fact it was worn 1 day. It is not worth the money and embarrassing to give as a gift.",Negative

"No scent, leaves black stain on tub and skin. The product smells super strong in the bottle -almost very chemical like. I followed the instructions on the bottle, but there was no smell upon hitting the water and there was so little salt used (and none of it actually the beneficial bath salt) that the bath wasn't as pleasant. I hate to give a small business a bad review, but this formulation needs to be revised.",Negative

"Disappointing Like tons of others who did not read the product details carefully enough, I expected this to be metal.  It is printed on photograph paper.  Now I have to frame it.  The thing that bothers me the most about it is that I have doubts that the actual artist was involved in this transaction.  For all I know I just overpaid an art thief.  What a racket!  The octopus model probably wasn’t paid either.  At least it is a wonderful image.",Negative

Not for sensitive ears These were the most uncomfortable earrings I have ever bought. Within minutes of putting them on my ears started to itch! They turned red and started flaking the next day. One clasp came undone and I lost it and eventually found it. Don’t buy if you’re allergic to fake jewelry or have sensitive ears.,Negative

"Bulky. Block of plastic with no refinement. This is a wildly popular holster. I bought it since it was on sale and I had other products from them. This time, I am disappointed. The product is very bulky making on belt carry feel/look silly. It lacks any refinement on the edges and is just a massive rectangle. The clip juts out so the bottom of the holster is flapping. Being a piece of plastic, it does not feel like it will last. I find myself bumping this holster into things at random, it is so bulky. I would return it but not worth the hassle.",Negative

I can no longer wear it anymore due to the nasty color it turned definitely not worth it. Wish I could give zero stars!,Negative
Keyring is to small to hold more than a few (3) keys. I would not have purchased this item had I seen it in a store. Was very disappointed in sizing and clarity. Looked like a magic marker for engraving.,Negative

Don’t waste your money! Very bulky ring.  This ring actually bruised my finger.  Returning is a hassle so I just threw it out!,Negative
No scent whatsoever. Not worth the money. I can’t smell a thing. I even tried the free samples they sent. The only reason I purchased this is because it’s the only one made in the US. But steamers from other companies are a lot more powerful with nice aroma.,Negative
Disappointed I give this a 1 just because only the tshirt came .didnt get the skirt or the teddy bear or nothing of what is in the pic!!! So i hade to stress matching with a skirt.. either then that the tshirt was ok,Negative

"Junk They have a gritty textured surface making them hard to slide against each other while loading into a magazine.<br /><br />The first round that I attempted to load in my M57 jammed in the chamber and locked up the slide.<br /><br />When I was finally able to rack the slide back, the extractor ripped the entire rim off the rear of the round.<br /><br />I promptly unloaded them all out of my magazine and threw them in the trash.",Negative
La cadena es de poca calidad Esta bonita pero la cadena se ve muy barata y de mala calidad,Negative
Damaged [[VIDEOID:f7096989c3f43b20dd7f873a40c00f8d]] These would be so beautiful if they were not damaged. They are damaged in the same place which makes me think it’s part of the process of making them into earrings. Paying $29 I expected better quality.,Negative
"Waste of money Do not purchase, you will lose it and be sad. Would like to give no stars. The bar was very short. It did fit okay as far as the thickness of my piercing hole but the bar that bent was very short so it kept falling out of my nose. I lost it within 2 days of owning it. A complete waste of money. I am very disappointed.",Negative
"Very disappointed! Not at all what I was expecting—very disappointed—if I didn’t know this was my first name, I wouldn’t recognize it. The first initial doesn’t even look like a “c” & the same tiny size as the rest of the letters—maybe there’s something I’m missing but I’m not impressed  :(",Negative
Cheap Horrible quality ! Not worth the money,Negative
"Disappointed Not the colorful stone that was shown in pic.  Two of the<br />Pics are with full sun and one with LED lights.  When not in either it’s pretty drab.  Also while the wire work is beautiful,  there are many cut points that are sharp and caught<br />On clothing.  The rough stone takes away from the “fire” of it.  Really disappointed as this was for memorial situation.  Returning.",Negative

"Eh... I was really optimistic about this iPad case. The reviews were good, the price was fair, and I was okay with the delayed shipping from China. It's been a few weeks since I received it in the mail and I haven't even been able to use it. The oil they used for the leather apparently doesn't dry...ever. I'm assuming they just used too much leather oil. I received it in the mail 15 days ago and it's still damp. I put a fan on it for 48 hours...still damp. I set it on a shelf in my garage where it's warm but not hot...still damp. I tried putting the case on my iPad but it leaves a thick film on the screen because the oil is so damp. I didn't leave the case on for more than 60 seconds. The case does look nice. If the case ever dries out, I will add another star to my review.",Negative
One Star no scent,Negative
Misleading Pic showed fur on blanket. Mine did not have the fur. They will not return/exchange. Will never order from them again. Very disappointing.,Negative

"Fades and turns color My mom wanted to buy my son his first bracelet so she asked me to find one that I liked. I came across this one and chose to go with this option as it was a great price and had great reviews. My son was only able to wear it for about a week as it turned silver/blackish. When I first opened it I loved it ,but it truly is poor quality and would not recommend it all as it is a waste of money and lasts so little.",Negative

"Disappointed with fit I submitted my prescription measurements hoping to have an equivalent to a medical supply company but when it arrived it looked great! but... too wide and too long to fit and restrict the finger from over extension. I asked the seller if they would resize it as I saw others had the same issue... no response. After another week or so, I tried to contact the seller again but my only option was to return it without correction. I am very disappointed.",Negative
Ver flimsy Very bad quality and flimsy. Did not sit straight on my nose at all. Not good value for money. It’s lightweight and to me that was the only good thing about it.,Negative
"Does not close The hoop does not close. Therefore, the feather pendant is always falling off or the earring is always completely falling out. There's no way to tighten the loop so that it doesn't fall out or to not loose the pendant.",Negative

Description totally lie not on adjustable chain Not an adjustable chain very deceitful<br />Email is not right it does not accept sending message from company,Negative
Overpriced & Cannot Recommend! Delivery took longer than average Amazon shipment!  Once actually got it disappointed in product.  Picture was very deceptive & to us over represented the product actually received.  Upon opening hour hand was not connected properly (flopped around) and both other hands were bent.  Had to reconnect the hour and  get the other hands bent back properly to get it working.  Definitely overpriced @ $32.90! Cannot recommend this item @ this price:(,Negative
To thin don’t recommend The fabric is very thin.  Both of mine are torn and I definitely do not recommend buying.,Negative
"Poor quality round actual key ring I don't really mind that the tractor itself was so lightweight as I bought it as a gift for the spare tractor key.  I am disappointed that the actual key ring itself is so flimsy.  If you purchase this, just know you don't want to use it for any primary keys, and probably only one spare key.",Negative
Very light weight Very light weight and uncomfortable,Negative
This was perfect for my need Gave as gift to members of an organization with the similar logo & got one for myself. Very delicate - both chain & pendent. Priced well. Extremely pleased.<br /><br />Update: I had to return all 4 necklaces as the chains tarnished. Very dissapointing.,Negative

Low quality The custom words are just ironed on and the date on the sleeve was not placed correctly. It arrived with the date on the lower sleeve cuff. Overall disappointed in this and would not recommend.,Negative
"Very upset. It came with half the amount of screws, no pre-drilled holes, no stickers, and the screws aren’t even long enough to put the thing together.<br />Not worth the money paid for a few pieces of wood.<br /><br />Make sure u have your own screws & your own way to out this together successfully.",Negative
pretty piece Pretty piece. Sadly not all the pieces came (stopper),Negative
Can’t find a purpose for them. Useless These are useless. They aren’t absorbent at all. I literally cannot figure out what to use them for. They are pretty and soft. But won’t wipe your mouth off either.,Negative
"Cute but the ""diamonds"" came out with a few months These were my favorite, stylish, fake nose rings that I ordered. They were cute, fairly comfortable, and stayed in place. Unfortunately, while the ring itself held up nicely, the decorative parts fell out within a few months. They need to secure them better before I would consider buying them again.",Negative
"So disappointed! Not the right months! Came in with May 2017 - May 2018<br />It's ordered in August 2017...  only May and June 2017 have expanded pages.  Will not order again!  Due to starting a new job in 2 days, cannot send back - need a calendar of some sort.",Negative

Cheap chain These necklaces were a lifesaver when getting my daughter to go to kindergarten. Unfortunately her chain broke the 2nd week she wore it.,Negative
"DIFFICULT Difficult to put in the Fitbit and it doesn't register your sleep. I threw it away, not worth the effort of returning",Negative
Item is much smaller than it appears to be. It is too small. The colout and design is great but way too small.,Negative
They work briefly. Me and my best friend of 30 years have looked at these forever and I finally bought them as a surprise the first 2 weeks were amazing then BOTH units stopped working all together. I can't believe I am out that much money for nothing.,Negative
Blurry stamp The pic with 3 stamps is what I was sent of how the stamp would look. the other 2 are what it looks like. It's blurry. I can't read my name clearly or the I was told I've used the wrong ink. It's water based ink that I use on all my stamps.  I did ask for and received a refund.,Negative
"Very flimsy I had high hopes for this product, I like the look of the design. I really wanted to like it. The problem is it’s made of an extremely lightweight material that causes it to tip over all the time. Taking glasses on and off it knock it off balance, lightly bumping against it causes it to tip. A simple solution would be a weighted base, which it doesn’t have. It is now broken since it tipped and crashed onto floor and broke apart. For the price, I would have been better buying a paper towel holder and sticky tape. Very disappointed, would not recommend buying. Gave it two stars instead one one since we did get a year worth of use out of ( even though it tipped all the time) before the final tipping broke it",Negative
Turned Finding it hard to believe these are silver. Turned dark and hurt my ears,Negative
"Cute but very small, hard to open/close I really liked this septum piercing and it looks lovely, but the circumference of the hoop is very small, so it's not very comfortable to wear. Also, you have to bend the hoop itself to ""open"" and ""close"" the jewelry, which makes it basically impossible to return it to the exact same shape and is also uncomfortable if the hoop gets twisted and the slightly open side gets in your nose.",Negative
Almost got me. I'm normally not like this but I almost bought this for myself until it said it was for men. I didn't realize Dungoen Masters couldn't be girls. Lol,Negative
It broke after three times being worn Middle ring fell off after being worn three times.  I really like the look of it on but quality was disappointing,Negative
Not the same as my last one. This is my second shampoo bar from Avitals and it is definitely NOT the same.  This one is super soft and is falling apart in my hands. I am storing it in the same open container with drainage and I do not keep it in the shower. Very disappointed,Negative
Only the picture I thought this would be 4 pictures with frames because paying $17 seems a bit much for 4 pieces of paper,Negative
"Not exactly what I expected I ordered this for a birthday gift.  I didn't realize until I received it, that is was just a paper print.  The cost for the ""print"" was much more than I think it should be.  Especially since it doesn't include a frame and I have that additional cost.  Don't recommend it.",Negative
Waste of money Changing review. Already falling apart. Too expensive to be so poorly made. Do not waste your money.,Negative
Not like picture [[VIDEOID:b79aeefbdc0aee2f4299bf5ee5ac9a77]] I ordered rose gold and got gold. The design is also so much bigger.,Negative
Busted Not very well made. Busted first work out with my 11 month old Lab. I’d have say to spend more $$ get a good one. In order to get a refund they want you mail back with sand pouring out. Absolutely terrible customer service. Keep Looking,Negative

Peeled in less than 1 month Started peeling at the bottom and is rolling up very annoying.,Negative
The vinyl is very thick and hard to handle. ... The vinyl is very thick and hard to handle.  The giant letter in the background of the picture  doesn't allow for the actual name to stick properly. Not worth the aggravation or money.,Negative
"My first shepherd’s staff gets five stars I am thankful for my shepherd staffs but was spoiled by the finer craftsmanship of the first one which is six inches longer, much straighter, much thicker, and also quite functional. This latest staff that I received bends easily. The first staff is about perfectly round, straight and strong. It won’t bend. The latest one is thin, flat down the front and flat down the rear though the sides are rounded. It bends easily and I’m afraid it will break. Having received a less than satisfactory reply I must give this particular staff a low rating.",Negative
"Poor design Although these earrings looked cute online, they are designed poorly.  Too light weight to hang correctly and not secure.  Within the first 4 hours of wearing them (seriously) I had lost one.  VERY  expensive and disappointing.",Negative

"Break easily!! My son wanted this for school for his mask, not even had them a week and both of them broke at the metal clasp! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",Negative
"Doesn’t fit to the egg! Don’t waste your money! The stamp isn’t flexible at all, so when you try to use it on a rounded egg, the stamp cannot fully press on it, so half is missing every single time. I have this as a Christmas gift and it’s embarrassing 🙈",Negative
Poor quality ALL METAL PARTS ARE COMPLETELY RUSTED,Negative
Sizing is way off Sizing of the ring was off by a full size and ring began to tarnish within a week.,Negative

"Misleading I only paid $2.66 for this so I am not too mad, but had I paid regular price I would return it. The pictures are very misleading. You would think it is a 3d ornament, but sadly it is a flat piece of cardboard just like the paper tree air fresheners. It is cutr, but definitely not worth the original price.",Negative
crap junk. arrived all bentvcoming off the backing ugh ... just junk dont waste your money,Negative
Pretty This item was not as big as it appeared and the material is awful! The design is nice but don’t wash it w other items bc it runs.,Negative
Essential oils in this product The product needs more essential oils that are listed on the packaging. I buy these oils regularly and know how they smell and their benefits. I smell goldenseal but not the frankinsense or myrrh.<br />Add more to the product.,Negative
RIP OFF THIN PAPER All this is is a thin piece of paper a page ripped out of a dictionary and then they print it the Eiffel Tower in Paris on the front of it it is so paper thin it is not a by 8x10 the measurements are off completely!

No time to reorder, leaving me to either display the messed up poster or leave the space I planned to display it a blank wall.  I have it under our dining room rug, hoping to flatten it our enough to adhere to foam board.  Very sad.<br /><br />The two stars are because it is cute - would have been great.",Negative

nothing like photograph ordered this ring twice and both times it came looking little like the picture. it was a “washed” version of what appeared in the photograph with none of the crisp detailing i was expecting. unusual  for a Novica product.,Negative
ONE HOUR PHOTO PRINT?? This looks like a pic printed at a one hour photo shop. Definitely not worth $11.95+tax.,Negative
Not worth the price These earrings are no where near worth what I paid from them. It is as if I got them at the dollar stores,Negative

Your look at spending close to 40$ for something that does not stick. It fell off the wall and got all rolled up during the night and picked up residue and stuff from my carpet and is no good now. I tried opening it carefully and it’s messed up . For the money I spent, it’s not worth it. I wanted to buy another one but it’s too expensive for something that does not stick.

"Poor quality 3D print job Probably should have read the reviews first. I was expecting something metal for it to be ""LPL style.""<br /><br />For the price, plastic makes more sense, but the quality is pretty lame. It's poorly a poor quality 3D print job. It feels incredibly cheap, and the ""resolution"" is pretty terrible. It's covered in coarse lines all over.<br /><br />Just buy your own 3D printer and make your own. Then you'll have a 3D printer!",Negative
Waste of money The nice part is they sent a replacement so you get two stickers. But within a week they both came off. They don’t fit through square readers. So they both can right off.,Negative

"Not worth $$ I was disappointed with this purchase. I thought from the photos that it would look more distressed wood...or even would appear more like a 3-d raised wood frame. It's just a big magnet. Which is still cute, but definitely not worth $20+.",Negative
Overpriced and chain is cheap. Very expensive to come with such a cheap chain.  It broke before my daughter in law could even wear it.  The little charm was nice but way too much money for just a small charm.,Negative

I opened them and instantly noticed that they are completely tarnished! I ordered silver on silver, but as you can see from the picture they are not silver! I was also disappointed by the look of them, they are much larger than I was expecting and they look cheaply made. I will be returning for a refund because even if they weren’t tarnished I am not happy with them.",Negative

When I first recieved this ring it was a beautiful shiny gold. I wore it for an hour then put it back in the box it came in.  A few days later when I go to wear the ring, to my surprise it is now a tarnished almost copper gold.  Very dissapointed.  Bought a similar ring from different seller and same thing happened.  No more gold filled rings for me.",Negative

"Design very different from image I had this item in a wish list for ages...was very disappointed that the design I received is very different (seller calls this variation result of hand making something, but as I design person myself who has worked in jewelry some...uh, no). Additionally, the flower design is a pretty thin cut-out just tacked onto the top of a cylinder band which is not the craftsmanship I was hoping for.",Negative
"Uhhh seriously I was expecting something nice, but they were printed copies.<br />Some effort on my side - I could have printed these myself.",Negative
Beautiful but not wearable The necklace is beautiful but the clasp doesn't hold and continues to fall off. So now I have a bunch of beautiful moonstone beads I need to repurpose.,Negative
"Jesus would not like this! Period. Are you serious. How is cutting up a Bible a holy thing to do? Also, I don't even believe that is what's happening here. They are printing out Bible versus, and selling them for WAY too much because any price is too much. They are taking advantage of your religious beliefs. Stop! Full stop! Jesus would not like this.",Negative
Great gift! ...While it lasts. Got this for my mom and we both love it! It was so cool to see the light change when the other person was thinking of you. Setup was nothing: you pretty much just plug it in and it works. Awesome! ...for about 4 months. Then they stopped connecting and just stopped working. Now they’re useless. So yeah—super cool while they last. Unfortunately they don’t last very long at all. Just came home one day and it wasn’t working. I expected them to hold up a lot longer than just 4 months!,Negative
Smelled great in the bottle at least The roller ball wouldn’t move and I couldn’t get the product to come out. It had leaked in the package and all over my purse. At least they smell good,Negative

"Sunflower Oil not Olive oil I fell in love with this brand years ago and was so excited when I found this on Amazon. I used to buy it from a special botanical shop here in the city. When I saw the price, I was even more excited.<br /><br />My original bottle fell and broke, so I decided to go online to the original website to purchase. I decided to purchase from Amazon as the seller is the actual company and not a reseller.<br /><br />Problem 1: They advertise this is using olive oil from their farm.<br /><br />Problem 2: They don’t use olive oil, as they use Sunflower oil which is a hormone disruptor and much cheaper than olive oil. They lied about being made with olive oil.<br /><br />Problem 3: The scent is nothing like the one I fell in love with years ago. This néw sunflower oil based one has no scent and dies down within in 5 mins.<br /><br />I’m extremely disappointed and was really forward to supporting this business, but they changed the formula to a cheaper and less quantity ingredients",Negative
"Description seems deceiving says “14k gold color plating” & very light weight Hoops appear nice, lightweight, comfortable, yet description seems misleading if 14k gold plating they’d weigh more; in fact these don’t seem metallic at all.<br /><br />Sry can’t recommend as good costume jewelry…",Negative

"Painful Infection I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.",Negative
Do not waste your money. This thing is so small. Smaller the my finger for $8 what a joke. I’ll never buy anything for this place again.,Negative

A little disappointed I received my canvas a few days ago and I was so excited when I seen it was close to arriving. But when I received the package was way smaller than the picture on Amazon makes it look. So I was disappointed that it was smaller than I expected and it cost me $120 for something that was a print out of a picture. I would’ve been OK with it if I paid $50 for it at max before $120 and how the Display picture makes it seem it’s very disappointing when it’s not anything like that.,Negative

It is a very light grey. Also the material is HORRIBLE. I've felt sand paper softer than this shirt. It is not at all flattering either. It's just a big body shirt.<br /><br />I also reached out to the seller to return this item and they never responded.",Negative
poor quality These are two pieces of regular paper. I'm pretty sure it's printed on a normal printer. Not worth the money.,Negative
Don’t waste your money!! It’s pretty cheap feeling. I wore it for one day. Started to hurt my ear. Took it out and threw it away.,Negative
Horrible reaction I absolutely LOVED this nose ring at first. It was thin and snug. Literally everything I’d been looking for. After about two weeks my nose became sore and red. I tried to take a pic of it but you can’t see the bump. It’s right inside my nose piercing. I removed the nose ring and white pus came out. If it was real it wouldn’t have caused a reaction. Hopefully mine was just a cheap fluke and the others wouldn’t be. Very sad because I loved this nose ring,Negative

"Not the quality I expected I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46. I did contact the vendor but got no response after waiting two weeks to write this review.",Neutral

Love Wonder Woman I wanted this necklace for years! I finally bought it for myself.<br /> My biggest complaint is upon arrival it took my at least an hour to unravel the chain. There is no reason I should have to spend the amount of time getting the chain apart from itself.<br />Another huge issue is two weeks later I notice when I went to put the necklace on it seemed to be tarnished a bit on the WW piece. It had been hanging up alone and there is no reason in two weeks it should be 'tarnished' so quickly. It's sterling but I have had pieces that sit for months and months that don't need cleaned. I have fake pieces even that don't change.<br />This wasn't a 10 or 20 dollar piece. If I hadn't waited so very long for this piece and had such high hopes and didn't pay over 30 dollars for it I wouldn't be so harsh on my review. But I was so excited about this for so long to get this for myself for so many reasons and for it not to be better quality upon arrival is very disappointing.,Neutral
"Wrong date/ Very small Product is beautiful, and they did an excellent job on the font and color, but I wish it was a little bigger and the date on mine was incorrect. I have enough time to order another, but it’s a bummer that we have to order twice. Hoping for a correct one this time",Neutral
Inaccurate sizing Smaller than I expected. Doesn’t match my other rings that are supposed to be the same size. Was super cute but painful to wear because it was too small.,Neutral

Beautiful [[VIDEOID:b42aad7b055dce09dc01974ebfc8040e]] I would’ve given five stars until I received my second batch and they were falling apart and sloppy made.

"Item is not proportionately sized for adult use. I was SO excited to receive this item. I had been looking for a while for a wood record table, which would also hold albums. I was even more ecstatic because it was handmade in the USA. I prefer to support local small businesses and products made in the USA. I didn't realize when I ordered it, the actual height and size of it would be so small and short. Honestly, I can adapt to the furniture size being small but it is ETREMELY small in height. I can sit in a regular chair, and it hits right about the same height. I did order the 12inch hairpin legs, which was my mistake. I should have gone with longer ones. In hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. However, I expect something to be advertised if both small enough to either fit in a kid's room or an adult's living room. I would have ordered accordingly. I am in search of longer hairpin legs. As it is now, I have to bend over to play an album and practically sit on the floor to search through the albums in the stand. Otherwise, quality of workmanship and woodworking were simple, classic clean lines just as I wanted.",Neutral
"clear paint smears not a distressed look to me I returned this product. It had two noticeable smears of white paint. I contacted seller and she did refund the money.

Good and bad The picture on each balloons came out really nice but I filled them up with the helium tank that you would buy from Walmart and the balloons didn’t float at all. I guess they were made out of a heavy material or there’s a different helium to use? They were still a hit at my daughters 21st but I which they would of floated… I was a little bummed about that. We just put tape on the back and stuck them to the walls. But great picture quality on the balloons.,Neutral
Smells so good but.... This spray smells divine. The only issues I have is that this dried my hair and scalp out instead of moisturize. I've used on damp hair and dry hair...same results so now I use it with other products combination.,Neutral
"Not very functional It’s a cute little match holder - but doesn’t strike the matches (strike anywhere matches) very well - I’ve broken multiple in half just trying different angles and applying more pressure to get them to light. Slightly disappointed because it’s a little pricey to be only decorative, the idea is neat though",Neutral
"Sample Size I bought some of these for my wife. I have been purchasing solid colognes for myself through Duke Cannon and thought these might be the femal equivalent.<br /><br />And they are, but they are very tiny. Yes, you could easily fit it in the tiniest of purses, but you could also lose it in the tiniest of purses.<br /><br />These are just big enough you could get a fingertip in them.<br /><br />The scent is okay. Nothing revolutionary.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it’s a solid ‘meh’.",Neutral

"A little disappointed It looks good and came very fast. But it's personalized it asks for the name so I put Brian like I needed.  But they didn't add the "" 's "" don't you think you would assume to put that?",Neutral
Eh I was really enjoying my case but literally three days after having it on my phone the lettering began to chip which made me realize It wouldn’t be long before it chipped off entirely. As I’m reading the comments and see that only few people have had this problem I’ll make the assumption that the manufacturers are most likely NOT consistent with their materials. So maybe they temporarily substitute products when they run out of their normal ones 🤷🏽‍♀️Idk,Neutral
Great product but...... Love the earrings.  Just what I was looking for.  Only problem was that there were only 3 earring backs in the package so I cannot wear them right away.,Neutral

"The color of the gold Is yuck I got this for my daughter as a special gift with our song lyrics on it And although it was nice to find someone to engrave so nicely and so fast I was really sad that it looked cheap. It doesn’t have a nice 14k look it looks more like 24k or just fake because it was a lot darker and won’t match her other jewelry. It’s a nice keepsake I guess, cuz I know it’s going right in the jewelry box and staying there.",Neutral

"not really lavender nor cedar...but How do I describe this scent?  Obsession for men by Calvin Klein cologne.  Obsession is described as a woodsy scent, I was hoping for a more masculine earthy scent (lavender can be all grandma-ish at least for me), so maybe what you're looking for exactly, but I was surprised how much it resembled the cologne rather than the earthy scent I was hoping for.",Neutral
"Very small This review is not about the quality of the item. They are beautiful and true to color. This is about value for money. Not worth it. They are very small and not the stationary I was looking for. I wanted a large page not a card. But like I said before, they are beautiful.",Neutral
Okay to try It’s okay nothing much to rave about,Neutral
"Beautiful but very difficult to read I bought the extra small tag & it is perfectly sized for my 8lb, average, long haired cat. It came beautifully packaged, no damage. They included a ring to attach to collar + 3 small rings/clips to attach tag to ring. Sorry that's so convoluted but idk the right terms for the ""rings"". The 1 star is for the difficulty reading the tag. The font is exactly what I ordered. The print is exactly what I requested. However, maybe because I ordered the shiny silver, I can't read the tag unless the lighting is perfect & I angle the tag just right. It was a miracle I got a pic that at least shows some of the words. Plus, Freya is camera shy... Or just likes to be difficult. I wish the lettering was in black on the shiny silver. That would have helped. We have many feral cats in my small town which are caught, taken to a vet, spayed or neutered, tagged & then released. Freya doesn't need all that hassle so if someone does capture her, I want them to know she's already mine. I requested that the bottom wording say ""Amy's - In/Outdoor. Perfectly done, but, as said above, difficult to read.<br />1 star for easy to read, 4 star for craftsmanship (minus 1 star only because the lack of color for words) & 5 star for lightweight.",Neutral

"Latching mechanisms have issues [[VIDEOID:dfcc56f0ca10edf48df8cae611f2abc]] The latching mechanism for the two earrings were very problematic with each one having the opposite issue.  One earring was so loose it wouldn’t lock shut and would likely fall out throughout the course of a day.  The other was so tight we couldn’t get it unlatched.  I had to get tools to bend the mechanism open and even after that it was still very tight.  I used a pair of pliers to tighten up the loose one, and it will now latch though still not sure how secure it will be.<br /><br />The earrings are beautiful and look great.  If you can get the latching problems resolved these would be a very good pair of earrings.",Neutral

"Runs Small Cute, but size up! I purchased an Adult women's shirt and it was a little snug, but still cute because you like a lady cut to be more form fitting. The kids shirt definitely was small. I would size up, even for kiddos. My little guys shirt fit more like a 7-8. Other people in our group also experienced the same. Shirt quality was okay and bright colors, but the other set we purchased from another vendor was much better!",Neutral

"Does not stamp on eggs An egg is rounded and larger at one end than at the other.  There is no place to stamp a flat stamp.  They did say it was a ""flat"" stamp but they also showed a picture of it beautifully stamped on an egg.  I tried everything and no way did I get more than part of the stamp on an egg.  The egg would have to be huge (like an ostrich egg, lol).  The stamp is cute and works well on paper or on an egg carton, so there are uses for it.",Neutral

"First one great, second one tarnished. This is the second time I bought this and the first time I wore it for 2 years and it was awesome! It didn’t tarnish at all. I only replaced it because one of the small balls was loose. The second one I got in September and it’s already tarnished.  I’m pretty bummed out about it. On another note if you’re having issues with smell this cuts that out. Overall I love it but I wish the quality was consistent.",Neutral
"Directions/Support suck. The product itself is awesome. Your directions are just a paper template. I used a laser guide to cut the template out perfect and the tray didnt fit. So then i had to keep cutting millimeter by millimeter with a jigsaw until it fit. I had all foam under my deck and didnt know where the drain hose should go. Tried calling 3 different times for suggestions and no one ever answered. Was working on it right then, needed help then not whenever they wanted to get back to me so i never left a voicemail. Called over a 30 minute period. Took me 4 hours to get it in but it sure does help my back and is a great product, just the directions/support suck.",Neutral

"These are pretty but They were a little larger than I envisioned. Not the artist's fault, just my ability to judge. The colour is very nice and overall I was pleased until I put them on. They came apart the very first time I wore them. When I went to remove them the glass separated from the back. So they are useless to me.",Neutral
"Watch your personalization... Product is good quality, but the personalization was incorrect. I paid for two personalization and only one was done - that's $15 down the drain.",Neutral
Nice looking ring but it’s not well made. I bought the ring for my mid finger. It’s adjustable for us with larger fingers. Quite thin and the hammered effect is not as prominent as I would like. I wear it but I’ve bought inexpensive silver that is better quality.,Neutral
LOW QUALITY PRINTS Literally just card stock laser printed photos of this art work. They didnt even bother to trim off the white. Really makes me wonder if its the original artist or if someone stole it from another artist. The thank you note for ordering it is on higher quality paper than the actual prints.,Neutral
"Did the job, but low quality A lot smaller than what I expected-but that’s on me for not reading the product details.  They did the job, the idea of them are good, but I took them out of the package and first thing that happened was one of the earring hooks came right off the tassel. Luckily I was able to hook it back in but it happened a couple more times before I even had the chance to wear them. The best part about these earrings is they are very light. Other than that the quality is not there.",Neutral

". Prettier and more vibrant in person. My complaints are that it didnt come with its own screws or hanging bits and it looks like the fabric (vinyl?) canvas was stapled on the wood a little sloppily. The images could have been scaled down a bit to include all aspects so on the sides you will see a lot of overlap. That may have been the intention but there seems to be unnecessary amount of space on the bottom left. Despite these issues, it really is a nice print overall and a good size.",Neutral
Save your money. They are light weight and they are a brown black. Not a solid black. Not truly black. They are a black brown.,Neutral
Leaves something to be desire. The magnet is not very strong and falls off the fabric very easily. Graphic is cute though.,Neutral
Very skinny bracelet In person this bracelet is very skinny which I'm not so happy about the one's like these in store or churches were there much thicker which is what I expected.On the other hand the durability is nicely strong and it looks just like picture.,Neutral

"Good sticker, but pricey The sticker looks nice and stays on well, and the design is clever. It is smaller than expected and expensive for what it is though. 9 bucks for 4 stamp sized stickers (especially if you only have 1 airpod case to use it on) is a bit high.<br /><br />I could've probably snipped the design picture and get a custom sticker print for a fraction of the price, but I bought these originals anyways to support the seller.",Neutral

"Be aware it's not mounted.  It's just the metal design I gave it 3 stars because the picture shows it mounted on a wood and the description stated its mounted with screws.  The metal item itself is beautiful but it's not mounted on anything so now I have to send it back or find a piece of wood, cut, stain, finish and mount the item myself. A lot more work than I planned for that's why I orderd it handmade so someone can do that for me. I love the peice but it's not complete.

"Decent Fabric quality, Prevents screen scratches I got this product to prevent scratches on the switch screen which it did do. Unfortunately for this product, screen protectors are its biggest rival since it can do the exact same thing in preventing screen scratches.

If you get one I highly recommend getting one just for its aesthetics (or if you don't plan on getting a screen protector which I do not recommend not getting one) since now it is kinda useless for me.",Neutral

Three Stars Nice a little flimsy need to be careful putting up,Neutral
Not worth price There are much better and bigger spa sets that are worth the price listed. This was a smaller than expected set. Nothing extraordinary to result in the price listed.

Ok but could have been better Thought the workmanship would have been higher quality.,Neutral
"Very small bale, poor design The mandala itself is beautiful, however, the bale of the pendant is small and thin even though it appears larger and thicker on the photos. You will only be able to wear it on a thin chain with a small clasp ring. I had to change the ring to a larger one in order to wear on a weightier chain or cord. I was going to buy a nice bale to put on pendant in place of ring, but the hole is the size of a pencil point. I would have given 5 stars if it had a decent size bale instead of the poorly thought out design.",Neutral

"Acceptable but amateur The high notes are ambiguous, lemony citrus with something else I don't particularly like.

Wish posts were thinner These are really cute but the posts are too thick and were hard to put in and hurt my ears when I tried them on. I compared to the posts of other earrings and they are probably triple the thickness of my other earrings. It’s too bad because otherwise they are very cute.,Neutral
"Size was smaller than before I had bought my husband one for his birthday and it was larger than most and very beautiful.  We both love it, so I wanted one for my bureau.

I would have gladly paid the extra $5 for the larger size.",Neutral
"Lost its shape right away, not snug enough, sharp I like the quality of the hoop, but the edges are a little sharp so it hurt to push through. Even though I twisted it the right way to insert so it didn't lose its round shape... It still lost its round shape. It's like an oval in my nose so if it twists around it looks weird. I'm going to keep it and wear it, but I wish I got a 6mm so it fit more snugly against my nose. I measured my old 18g ring that stuck out a little and it was more like 8mm, so I got the 7mm thinking it would fit snugly and I didn't wanna risk a 6 in case it was too tight. I also wish I got a 22g instead of a 20g because this seems a little thicker than I expected! But now I know. Hope this helps!",Neutral

"Great Banner!, but the picture lacks focus. This is a great banner. I couldn't get this anywhere else. The only problem I have with this is the low quality picture they used and enlarged it. You can see the pixels on the edges of the picture and it is fuzzy. The lettering seems fine, but looks like a word creation with a copy and paste picture from the internet without AI adjustment to enlarge it or a high quality picture to prevent picture degradation when over-sized. Appreciate the fast shipping though. Thank you.",Neutral
"Good pictures, some were questionable Overall I was contempt with the product, however there were some aspects of it that was a little off. Some of the pictures were very out of place and random that I did not think followed the theme the product was trying to portray.",Neutral

"Pretty but … These earrings are very pretty on, very light weight and I lived them for the 15 minutes I had them. I put them on when I got them, sat down and watched tv for a couple of hours, and when I got up, one had worked it’s way off and was lost. And that’s with me just sitting!

"Cute and useable I'm sure many people will enjoy it. For my purposes, there's wasted space and the organization should be changed: Any necessary 'meal prep' and 'notes,' shown on the front side, should be permanently placed with your recipes for future reference instead of repetitively on the then current week's menu list. The backside blocks for grocery lists would be better associated if formatted like the front side menus in full horizontal boxes just like on the front side; and, divided in three columns - breakfast, lunch & dinner. I will use these as it's nice seeing graphics instead of the usual, formal Arial (etc) font.",Neutral
"like made for a child's hand definitely not adult size These rings are tiny, like made for a child's hand definitely not adult size.

Great craft Just a little too wide,Neutral
Nice but thin Very thin,Neutral
Overall you need tiny toes Of course gold is bendable which I'm thankful for. But my toes can't handle it. One it's a little too tight even after bending. But I think getting used to a toe ring in winter is not the smartest idea. Will wait until flip flop weather to try again.,Neutral

Pretty but there are some issues It’s pretty and I love the way the text looks. The wood is also a really pretty color and grain. I did notice some issues on the edges. Some nicks and wood that needs to be sanded down. I was also a little bummed that it didn’t come with the hardware to hang it up. But I know we can fix those things ourselves here. Little disappointed but pretty overall.,Neutral

"Kind of light in weight and a bit flimsy seeming The color of these is great.  They are cute and a good size, but they seem a little thin to me.  They come across as a little flimsy because the metal that makes up the back and what goes into your ear bends and flexes pretty easily.  The decorative part does not, though.  I will definitely wear them.  The style is simple so they can be worn for many occasions, but I do wonder how long the gold will last or if they will tarnish soon.",Neutral
"Good quality , week made but kind of clunky style If I bought again I would get it in tan which suits its casual style more than the red.",Neutral

Super cute - but really hard to get in. These are super cute. I got for my top piercings I found the. Super hard to put in because of the little flat part that hooks into other end to keep in place.

"Cheap plastic earrings with no metal flower. For one thing, I never make comments… but the earrings are not what they appear to be in the images posted. The earrings are plastic.

"Really pretty, but don't like how the charm is attached This necklace would be beautiful if the charm wasn't removable! It's attached to the chain with a clasp that is usually used to fasten necklaces behind your neck. That part is usually hidden and not meant to be seen. But this necklace draws your attention right to it because it's right at the focal point - the charm! I'm going to have to open up one of the gold links to take that clasp part off, and then close the link back up around the chain so that it will look better. I think the clasp being right at the charm cheapens the look of the whole necklace. If it wasn't attached like that, it would be perfect, because the pearl with the shell on it is really cute!",Neutral

It gets the job done completely, because I was looking for a copper (non-plastic) foot basin. Without thinking I forgot I wanted to add epsom salt, and sometimes essential oils to the water.

Quality of paper isn’t what I expected I thought the print would be on thicker nicer paper. It seems pretty flimsy to me. The color of the ink was fine and I'm sure it will look great in a frame. I just thought the quality of paper would have been a lot better for the price of $11.95.<br />I probably won’t buy from this company again. I feel like I could have printed this myself. Too expensive for the price. It should be $4.99 not $11.95,Neutral

Short of using it as part of the wrapping for a gift, I would be embarrassed to actually gift this to someone.  I would not buy again at this price...",Neutral
"Elegant One Sign Such a good sign for a One year old photoshoot. It was in perfect condition when it came in. Package was outstanding and very well packaged to assure of no damage - If yours ever come in damaged most likely it was the Delivery Driver being careless. The only downfall is that it will not stand on its own, most likely because the sign is not bulky / thick which gives it an elegant look but wont allow it to stand on its own. I believe product is overpriced but I could not find any other One sign that looked elegant so it was worth it. Sign is very pretty.",Neutral

Cute but over priced This is a cute piece but not for $30 it is chunks of hopefully crystals melted into plastic. The picture looks like something you could wear with a nice upscale outfit but once you get it you realize this is more of a plastic beach or fun day out necklace that you wear because if it gets broke or lost it is no big deal.

"Poor quality To start off the print quality is very poor. I understand it on canvas but the picture quality is just bad. It's like look at a 1980 tv on a tube television. The delivery time was also excessive in my option, especially since they charge for shipping. When i finally received my package it was damaged upon opening the box... was very mad. The out side of package had no damage so this means it was put into the box with the damage preexisting.

sizing was off The extra ring fit properly but the ordered ring is not a 7. This ring is too big.,Neutral
Super cute Super cute. I bought one for each dog. My teacup got the smallest size and it's the perfect size for her.  My only complaint is that the engraving is super light on both of them and is kinda hard to read. Even on the larger one I purchased.  Good value for the money though.,Neutral

"Margins Way Off: Left (13/16"") & Right (1 1/2""), Top 1 3/4"" Bottom 1 1/2"" doesn't fit 11 x 14 mats This is a favorite John Muir quote (""He said the sun shines...""). However, Right/Left & Top/Bottom margins are WAY off, which I just discovered in attempting to place the five 11 x14 prints I ordered to place in 5-pack of 12 x 16 frames I ordered, which came with 2 sizes of mats to accommodate either 8 x 10"" OR or 11 x 14"" print. Now must go to frame shop and have mats cut down, or buy new custom cut mats. About the paper, I thought it would be parchment, but it's a photo of parchment on thin glossy paper. Could flow with paper quality, but it's just the fact that Lone Star Art Store in Texas didn't take the time to center type before printing, which is baffling and disappointing.

I can't get a good grip. I guess I could do a little ... It is a decent product.  It doesn't really work well for me.  The place where I put my hand is too thick.  I can't get a good grip.<br />I guess I could do a little whittling around that area to thin it out so my grip it tight.,Neutral

"No directions, not a fan of the scent So…..this product comes with absolutely no directions!  I wasn’t sure whether this was a leave in conditioner or a rinse out.  I ended up trying both ways and it ends up better on my very fine, thin, frizzy and wavy hair as a light rinse out.  I try to do right as I’m finishing, and then just one light rinse out with a squeeze dry.  I let my hair air dry with this in and it rolls into soft waves with a lot less frizz than normal.  I was not a big fan of the scent - it was too medicinal for me.<br /><br />I probably will not order again.",Neutral
"Lower quality than expected Cute design, but I’m doubting the inks are premium as they look more subdued (less pigmented) and a bit pixelated in real life, at least the ones I received. Plus, several of my stickers on one sheet look like black ink from another print job smeared on them... very unpolished looking. See uploaded image for detail. Item also arrived later than expected and when I’d sent an inquiry to the seller, I never did receive a response. So customer service appears to be lacking as well.",Neutral

"Photo Paper Copy I love the picture, i was thinking it would be on a canvas type of paper or something more than a glossy printer paper copy 8.5x11. It’s overpriced for what it is. I do love the message and the photo, but $13 is steep for something like this. Its just something I could've made and printed for significantly less. If it came with a frame of sorts that would've felt more realistic for pricing. Yes I knew it didn't come framed, I just saw the high reviews and grabbed it. Wish it was larger and on a more professional printed paper than the Fuji film photo paper.<br />However it does earn a few stars for the photo itself and the artwork. It is something I stumbled over and it was good timing. Ill have it framed and hung. I just wish it wasnt as expensive as it is.",Neutral
"Looks great, but doesn’t stay tight. Really like the look of this bracelet, but the tension holder, or whatever you call it, doesn’t stay for long.

Quality is ok kind of cheap looking/feeling If I had time to shop I could have found something better quality for the same price or less. I purchased this for my wedding and it was ok. The material felt cheap and the packaging was not pretty. I wouldn’t give this as a gift again. It’s more of a prop item for decoration maybe.,Neutral

"It's just a photograph, not an actual dictionary page art. Disappointed that it is not an actual dictionary page, why would someone want a regular photograph?? It's supposed to be unique...but it's not. It is a clear picture and the quality is good for a photo but I could've done this myself instead of paying $12. Not what I was looking for, but it's my own fault for not reading the reviews and misunderstanding what it actually was. I would have never bought it for a gift bc there isn't anything special about it.",Neutral
Alright It looked like it was made w love but it chipped pretty easily and quickly after wearing it in the shower for about a week. That made it unwearable because it bothered my skin. Def made w love. Kinda light in weight. The rope that it hangs from seems resiliant.,Neutral

"The stone protrudes pretty far out of the ring I like the idea of the ring. The stone sticks really far out off your hand so be careful with hitting it on everything throughout the day. Mine was just poorly made, although I'm sure that isnt the case with them all I can see them being very popular. It would be cool to be able to choose your stones because I wouldn't mind mine and my husbands stone instead of my birthstone and a cz. Maybe secure the pins that hold the ring on better. Mine could have just fallen out but I didnt wear it after I noticed that within the first hour of having it. Great ring though.",Neutral
Small Smaller than expected,Neutral
Easy return It was too small and thin couldn’t fit my nose. But they gave me a easy return,Neutral
"Not what was expected While this is crafted well, , for the price I expected way more opal to shine through.  It looks like a quartz necklace more then anything which makes me sad. To me not worth the price paid",Neutral
"Not Satanic The photos are beautiful of course, but they're not Satanic.",Neutral
Cute but gnomes in odd location. I expected the gnomes to be centered so that I could trifold the hand towel (which is typical). Instead the gnome picture is on the bottom right so there’s no way to hang and display it without the rough edge of the towel being visible. It’s not a classy hemmed edge either.,Neutral
Way overpriced Was a little disappointed that there was not more detail on the jar. This item is really overpriced,Neutral
So- so They did not stay in place as in the photo. The heavier front has a tendency to skip to the bottom.,Neutral
"Cheap leather, ring, and rivet. Text is accurate though I was expecting more for the money I spent. I only use it to hold my mailbox key, but it's very thin leather and the rivet and key ring are very cheap. Doesn't feel solid at all. For this price I think I overpaid",Neutral
"Okay The product itself was satisfactory. It's a little soft but it may be the fact that it's organic (which is not a huge deal). I just felt a little duped by the picture. With shipping I paid over $8 for a single tube of chapstick - I really thought I was getting more than one. I can't rationalize the price tbh. So while the chapstick itself was ok, I can't see myself buying this again.",Neutral
Three Stars It was just smaller than I anticipated.,Neutral
"Very pretty, not a large pendant, small. I like this pendant for stacking. It is very nicely designed, and crafted. Reasonably priced. But the chain was inferior.

The ring is a darker green enamel and there's a teal blue enamel circle in the middle instead of a stone like the other pieces. I still wear it since it's not noticable in unless you look at the set side by side, but I'm very picky so it bothers me a little.",Neutral

"Took longer than expected to arrive It’s cute, but for just a card it took a bit (on prime) to get here. But after it made it on time, was worth it as the birthday kid is a swiftie…",Neutral

It's comfortable to sleep in, but I get in a sauna daily and the heat makes it too hot, so I have to remove daily.  It's very hard to bend and line up so it looks closed.  If you can just leave it in it is pretty, but not practical for changing often.",Neutral
It’s ok Turns skin green.,Neutral
Too cold To thick to use as a drinking straw and cold on my sensitive teeth,Neutral
"pantry sticker Loved this product, but couldn't use it because it was meant for the outside of the door. The glass on my door has ridges on it and I would not be able to apply it properly. But all in all it was made well and is a great design. Wish they would make one for the inside of a glass door viewing it from the outside.",Neutral
"Lacks some numbers needed Great quality but....there are certain formations of days you cannot make! The specific number of days we needed wasn’t a possible combination due to lack of correct numbers on the blocks. So we had to add a day. If you can live with that, then yes, they’re very nice.",Neutral
"Not bad It is a beautiful bracelet, but after a couple weeks it turned my wrist green.",Neutral
Be informed…. The bracelet is beautiful and presentation is as well. The only reason I didn’t give five stars is due to the misleading advertisement. The picture in the ad as well as the picture that tries to get you to combine with another item for a special deal shows a group of three bracelets so I was expecting three and was surprised to get only one. I mentioned this to the seller who said she would change the verbiage to clarify but I don’t see that change. Just know you are only getting ONE bracelet and if you’re good with that I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with the quality.,Neutral
Packaging The packaging is very flimsy.  The metal sign is sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard and that’s it.  Small bends in the metal makes it look warped.  They really should rethink how they mail out the product esp for the price paid.  Looks beautiful but how it arrived is disappointing.,Neutral
Just a piece of paper I thought this was a sign - my error,Neutral

Not really as pictured. I liked it at first but the more I look at it the ring looks like it was made from a badly worn coin if it were made from a newer coin maybe  relief not up to par for the price.,Neutral
"Ummmmmmm TLDR: $5 for 1 sheet of 36 stickers<br /><br />3 stars because they'll arrived ahead of the estimated timeframe and are a good quality, look like the advertised photos.<br /><br />But HONESTLY, I feel SO DUMB for spending $5 on a SINGLE sheet of 36 (not ""approx. 54"" like it states) stickers from a seller with zero reviews and without having read the description better.

Very tight for a mans wrist The bracelet is very tight and feels like it may break if stretched over my wrist.,Neutral
"faded So sweet and dainty.  I loved that the length was adjustable but it was difficult to hook together into one very small hole.  But, my biggest complaint is that after wearing it for a couple weeks or so the sterling in the front faded/discolored and would not clean up with sterling cleaner.  It is almost like the sterling wore off and left cheap steal.  Disappointed and time had lapsed so that I was not able to return it.",Neutral
gift okay,Neutral
"Not for me Great packaging, great ingredients but just did not work for me. Worse it is making my natural, undyed, untouched, dark ashy brown eyebrows turn blonder and red. I only try one new thing for my face or body at a time, and this was the first thing I have tried for my eyebrows. I don’t  use eyebrow makeup or gel or anything, so this was the only thing that could be changing my eyebrow color. It may just be me, but I wanted to put it out there in case anyone else had similar issues.",Neutral

Meh I have mixed feelings about these earrings. I liked them till I wore them. Not my style but they are pretty in their own way. Seeing it in person though it just looks like colorful warts on my ears with the texture. To say the least I’m giving them to my cousin now. Pretty purple but not my style.,Neutral
"Different from what I expected From the pictures I was expecting these to look more like a polished disc. They look more like the post of an earring that you can DIY and attach something to the front of. I still wear them occasionally, comfortable and good small size.",Neutral
Too small. This bracelet is vety petite and the customized name printed is not defined. It is too fine and barely readable.,Neutral
"Sub par workmanship I was so excited when I ordered my noodle board. The seller was responsive and designed my board with a rooster design.  When the board arrived I found that the workmanship was less than good. The handles are loose and cannot be tightened. They are loose enough that I am afraid to use them to pick the board up. It is also obvious that the seller put the handles on incorrectly and replaced them, leaving holes that he fixed with putty. That would be okay if it wasn’t so obvious. The attached pictures show the repaired holes and how they look on the board. There are also holes on the back of the board that were made when the seller put the handles in the wrong spot. They were left unfilled and it looks unfinished and cheap. The board itself is made with three pieces of wood that do not lay flat making It difficult to put anything on it. I contacted the seller to see if there this could be remedied but I got no response. I recommend you use another vendor if you want a noodle board. The quality and service are lacking here.",Neutral
Quality was soso Cute saying - but the towel was low quality,Neutral
"I was still a little disappointed with the way the stone looked vs The ring itself is well made, but keep in mind the stone will not look the same as the photo. With that said, I was still a little disappointed with the way the stone looked vs. how it is represented. I knew I wouldn't get what was shown in the photo, but the opal is more of an opaque/milky white and you really have to work with it in light to see the slight iridescent qualities and even then, it doesn't shine, or look beautiful. There is some smokey grey mixed in, too, which I don't love. It my choice to take a chance on this without seeing it in person, so I'll keep it, but I don't think I'll take a chance on opals without seeing the exact piece I will be getting. I think the seller/maker meant well, but some stones are just going to look better than others. Maybe i'll try something other than opal from this seller, because I do think other stones are more forgiving in their differences.",Neutral

"Worth the money if host a lot of events. It came in box filled with packing peanuts so right out of the gate it was a mess just trying to get it out of box. The smell of clear coat was really strong as the box was opened. The organizer was actually wrapped inside of a 13 gal white trash bag. So I was afraid of what what I was going to find once I got it free of the peanuts, trash bag and box.  But I was pleasantly surprised. Everything looked good. As it is definitely a handmade product I tried not nit pic little things. But when you pay $150 for something that is supposed to hold paper plates and plastic silverware I figured I could be a little picky. The burlap ribbon was glued on a tad bit crooked. I can’t pull it off and realign it.  I wish the compartments were larger. I host up to 45 people on average for cookouts and get togethers and it simply isn’t big enough to hold the tray style Styrofoam plates. But it is big enough for the regular paper plates. But not big enough to hold bowls. Now, in all fairness the dimensions were provided by the seller, so that is my fault for not paying attention. But the compartments for the forks, spoons, knives were absolutely perfect! Heads up, I left the organizer Out in the garage for 3 days and you could still smell the clear coat. So if you’re  needing this for an event make sure you buy ahead ahead of time so it has time to cure. It’s sturdy and very well put together. I feel this organizer will last a lifetime. The handles on the sides made it easy to move it around. And they felt very securely attached. I will give this product 5 stars if they fix the packing issue and clear coat smell.",Neutral

It could’ve been sanded flat but it wasn’t. The paint is rustic. The stenciling on it is even more rustic. No matte sealer was applied.",Neutral

I tried to return and get the larger size but the shipping fee to return will cost more than what I paid for the necklace. It would be nice for them to have a sizing chart so ppl don’t have to guess.

I'll keep looking for a masculine scent.",Neutral
"Great size, beautiful decal I love it. The problem I have is that the decal was sticky after it was placed on the water bottle, and there was no way to get the stickiness. It was made with iridescent paper, but you really can't see it, since things keep adhering to the decal, when it comes in contact with clothes or anything fuzzy.",Neutral
Expected better quality I like the pose and the quote but I don’t think the quality of the print is as good as I was expecting. I was hoping the quality would have been as good as the Lauren Bacall print. Lauren’s picture looks like I took it with my camera. Humprey’s is not as clear,Neutral
Nice....but.... Very nice.....until I tried ordering another piece....it took weeks to arrive!,Neutral
"Beautiful decal but apply when you aren’t pressed for time Ok, so staring at this decal on my wall makes me feel like my efforts were not in vain, because it’s a lovely decal.<br />What’s not so lovely is the nerve wrecking time I had getting this thing up! First of all the piece is huge and comes tightly rolled up. It’s not multiple sheets that you layer until you get the finished product, so application is quite tedious.<br />I started from the top and worked my way down.<br />I initially struggled with air bubbles and what seemed to be a lack of bonding to my walk, but once I got to the leaves it began to stick and the bubbles weren’t as bad. But, I faced another problem- tearing. It tore in several areas as the decal refused to leave the backing in some areas and then while I was working the left, the white leaf was almost invisible on the backing and tore a bit because I failed to see it. Luckily the tears are hardly noticeable unless you really scrutinize the thing.<br />Would definitely recommend using a tool to apply this decal to make it easier to remove air bubbles as you go.<br /><br />I’m only giving this 3 stars because it was a pain to put up, and I felt like I struggled more than I should have had to. Otherwise, it’s a beautiful addition to the room and I do get compliments from everyone that sees it.",Neutral

"No scent, but still works. It was a huge bar, and there was ground up pistachios in the soap, sort of exfoliating. But there was ZERO pistachio scent, which is the actual reason I ordered it. Works great in the kitchen because it doesn't fit down the drain when we drop it.",Neutral

Pretty but not practical I purchased two set of these beautiful coasters and have two left that aren’t broken. They are too thin and break easily. When I say easily - if the coasted sticks to the bottom of your glass and falls to the floor it breaks. They also warp if you have a sweaty beverage.<br />I sent the seller an email asking if they make a thicker version and told them the problem I was having. They never responded to my email<br />Or request. Love the way they look and was so disappointed when I found another one broken.,Neutral

Ok gift It’s cute. The stone is big but  the name tag is barely readable.,Neutral
"Not a great clasp I love the necklace, so very pretty, but the clasp is terrible. A small ring needs to be added to the chain as to make it easier to clasp. The only downside, cause it's a beautiful piece.",Neutral

I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good.

Photo a bit deceiving. Looks cute. but very cheap material . Plan on getting a new chain.,Neutral
Be informed…. The bracelet is beautiful and presentation is as well. The only reason I didn’t give five stars is due to the misleading advertisement. The picture in the ad as well as the picture that tries to get you to combine with another item for a special deal shows a group of three bracelets so I was expecting three and was surprised to get only one. I mentioned this to the seller who said she would change the verbiage to clarify but I don’t see that change. Just know you are only getting ONE bracelet and if you’re good with that I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with the quality.,Neutral
Beautiful ring but ...... The ring is beautiful and it’s also very comfortable but the reason why I gave it a 3 stars is because the ring is so smooth and shiny that you can see the scratches easily. On the 3 rd day I wore it I could already see small scratches on the top and I don’t remember how it got scratched.,Neutral
"item fine but .... I  purchased these birthstone aquamarine earrings for one granddaughter but unfortunately they were not available in peridot, so chose a similar style pair also made  by Jewelry by Dawn of peridot for the other granddaughter. When they arrived, each was in a separate little baggie however, both were stuffed into a tiny white box.  I felt it was tacky plus had to go out and purchase another tiny white box to put the other granddaughter's earrings in. I just felt it was poor service by the seller. Not the end of the world, but the girls get their presents at the same time and 10yr. old girls sure notice  when their presents are differing. I knew I could get ""away with different styles"" because they have different birthstones. I probably would never have thought about it if there were no tiny white box at all.",Neutral

"Cute, but odd and seems like it will die soon So I bought 3 of these for my mom and 2 for me since they didn't look like plants that should stand alone. These plants are a bit weird. I guess I didn't understand what an ""air plant"" really was. I think a picture should be shown of the plant, with no roots, that come separate from the gold plant holder (that really looks like a napkin holder). You literally just push the plant into the holder. It looks cute right now, but the instructions on the card also say I have to feed the plant once a month with ""our Tilandsia food"" -- uh really? Then it's gunna die because I'm not buying some food to add to the water I have to spritz on the plant... Kinda funny the price went up a dollar since I bought the last 5 from the ""prior batch"".. definitely not worth the price, but I will mist my 2 plants 3-4 times per week and see how long they both last.",Neutral

Not for continuous wearing, it'll turn your wrist green. It scratches easily and needs to painted in a clear coat it it fades after a week or so. Didn't get it wet, it just got worn out fast.",Neutral
"Not as nice as the picture These are okay, but they are not as pictured. Please see my attached pictures. The earrings I received do not have the spiral shape and are not as substantial as as pictured in the ad. As a result they just look kind of limp. They just aren't as attractive as the pictures in the ad. They do appear to be silver.  They are a nice shiny silver color. They are lightweight, but very delicate so I would be very careful with these so they do not break.",Neutral

"Difficult to apply I was so excited about this decal for my son’s room. I have purchased and applied at least a dozen different wall decals to my children’s rooms over the years with no issues, but this decal application was unbelievably difficult. The decals simply wouldn’t stick firmly to the wall, even after dozens of passes with credit cards and hands. So when we began to pull off the front layer, it was basically a nightmare with the decals detaching from the wall which resulted in stretching and ripping. With the help of two family members, we were able to painstakingly hold and maneuver and pat each decal into place, and while the far off results look good, if you get near the decals you can see many, many tiny rips and folds and wrinkles.",Neutral
"Beautiful but not the most comfortable The weight and thinness were just what I was looking for, but Because these don't have a clasp and are very soft gold, they warp extremely easily. I bent them the diagonal way you're supposed to, to insert, and one of them still ended up slight warped so that about half the time, it doesn't lay parallel to the other nose ring and I have to twist it a little to get it to lay down right. Also, because they don't close completely, and because the ends aren't rounded, if the open end gets positioned inside the piercing itself, and you blow your nose, it really hurts. All in all, I wouldn't buy it again, but it doesn't bother me enough to return/get a refund. It's just annoying how few other closure options there are in this thinness/gauge. I would probably chose one with a rounded end next time around.",Neutral

I only have a screwdrivers and it was quite difficult. I couldn't even use two of the screws since they did not line up correctly. But it looks great and seems stable so I am overall pretty happy,Neutral
Disappointed I can't hang it up I am disappointed it doesn't have a hole or metal loop/clip on the back so I can hang it. There's nothing. It's also thinner than I thought it would be. The price is too high just to add paint. I think painting it should come with the purchase at a lower price at least.,Neutral

"Wrong color? I just applied it to the wall. Not that hard to apply at all and it is easy to fix. Well packaged and the sample star was good to see if it would stick to the wall or not.<br />Looks a little busier than what I thought, but still looking good!<br />The only issue is that I ordered blue color to match with my wall&Tardis, but it looks like I got black color. Was unable to know until I peel off the paper. So kinda disappointing.",Neutral

Does not stick to the door. I ordered these for our cruise on the Mardi Gras. It would not stick to the doors it worked on the cabin walls but not the doors. Not sure if the newer ships doors are different than the older ships. I did not pack tape so could not use as a room finder. They looked nice though. Just not very strong with its magnetic power.,Neutral
Buy a great looking frame. Or don't buy it. This picture it self is not worth the money I could have had this printed myself for cheaper. When I put it in this frame it all came together .,Neutral

"The bad, the good and the beautiful... The bad news....the print was delayed twice, but UPS came through on the second date (busy shipping time of the year, I get it).  The paper print had two minor creases, not severe, but not noticeable (I hope).  Paper prints may not be an option going forward.  Return is not an option either, don't wish to go through it again.  Maybe a canvas print to replace it later, but too anxious to get it on the wall of the river home.<br /><br />The good news....print quality is very nice. Nice enough to be framed without glass (just like canvas).  Framing material (cedar), D-rings and push pins are ready in the woodworking shop.  This may have been Carel Fabritius' last painting.  In 2003 it was cleaned, and tiny indentations were found in the surface with no cracks (possibly created before the paint even dried) maybe caused by the Delft Thunderclap.  A gunpowder factory exploded and destroyed a good portion of the city.  Killing about hundred people, Fabritius being one of them.<br /><br />Always admired this painting.  The bird looks as if it could fly right off the surface.  Evidently these birds were 'trainable'; hence, the gold chain securing it to the perch.  I guess it was 'The Pet Goldfinch'.  I have read the original is worth about $300 million.<br /><br />Very pleased to have it in my collection.<br /><br />Post Review:<br />Turned out just stunning!  Can't even see minor indentations and didn't even have to add glass front.",Neutral

Will see how leather wears.",Neutral
Necklace Some of the letters were not clear. But the piece is still pretty.,Neutral
Pretty but Small It's a very pretty necklace. But the stone is so small and the chain it's on fits more like a choker than a necklace. Kind of disappointed in the amount we paid for something that looks more like an accessory for a child,Neutral

The charm is too small to know what it is... Purchased (2) because I wanted to give one to my Mama... sadly returned both.

"Nice, Handy, but a little big. :-) This product is an excellent idea, and handy, convenient and seems pretty well made. BUT-- it's a bit big, as it allows towels to hang down just a bit too low off your stove handle.  The crocheted, button part needs to be about an inch or so shorter, and the ring smaller, for a tighter fit for the towel. Like I said, great idea, as plastic clips others sell snap and break. But this needs to be smaller. Overall decent product! 😊",Neutral
"Came with grid lines - Didnt know what to do UPDATE:  I didnt know you were supposed to peel off the backing with the grid lines!

However, it took way too long to arrive and it was a birthday gift. I ordered this on July 22nd and received it August 20th. I did not understand why there are visible grid lines on the finished product. They should explain that you peel off the backing with the gridlines.

Different necklace than pictured The necklace is beautiful and lightweight. It is just short of 2” at about 1 3/4” but still an acceptable size.<br />The only issue I had with the purchase that was a gift for me is the necklace itself is different than what is shown in the photo and other reviewers photos.<br />The photos show a black rope like cord with a metal ring. The actual cord that came with the pendant is a very thin and cheap fake leather material with an adjustable slide knot.  So now I have to go out and purchase a real black rope cord like shown as this is what I wanted and expected.  Removing 2 stars for the bait and switch.,Neutral

"Good, but bowed a little I love these corbels, but the weight of the quartz counter made them sag a tad, so we had to use shims to make the counter level. They still look and work, but they aren't perfectly square, and have a space that needs to be filled where the shim is. We made sure to get 9&#34; corbels with a 12&#34; overhang counter, so it should be able to hold without bowing.

"The truth about vegvisir ""The Vegvisir symbol is very old and sacred. Viking and Norse sailors used this symbol as it was believed to show the way back home and protect them from storms. This is why it is also said to be a viking compass.""-from the product description. Yeah thats actually complete crap. The real Vikings never used it, they wouldnt have even known what it was. Heres the truth: The symbol known as “vegvísir” is an celandic folk feature borrowed from continental occult magic “Solomon's testament”. It is about 160 years old and its use is limited to the 2nd half of 19th century in an Icelandic city of Akureyri.Apr 5, 2019.

My stone is almost sea foam green and creamy- no reflected light at all.  The silver work is nice and the necklace is long enough for me but as already mentioned the clasp link is small.

Image isn’t clear I don’t want to discourage future shoppers but the pic on Amazon and what you get is very different.

The name on the back of mine is so small also not like the image. I’m pretty bummed it isn’t what was shown especially waiting the full ship time plus some.,Neutral

Get what you pay for Let me start by saying this sign is on card stock but I don’t mind that at all because I don’t want anything that weighs too much hanging around my sons neck. The size is great. Reason I’m giving three stars is because of the marker work and the handwriting. I thought this would have been printed out and would be neat. Someone clearly took a sharpie and was messy with the writing. I don’t want to spend more money from a higher quality shop since my son most likely won’t wear this down the aisle anyway.

"Good for a short time The price of these bracelets are great. They do not last a long time as the string gets worn out fast and snap easily. Mine lasted about 2 weeks before breaking and the other one broke 2 days after that. They are cute, abd the magnetic heart didnt connect properly unless you adjust it to create the heart.

"Pretty good labels The leather is good quality and the color was true to the pic. I wish the stamp with my company name was a little darker though, you can barely read it. I was also hoping my name would be on both top and bottom, but at this price I'm pretty happy with the purchase. These tags take my crocheted items to the next level of professionalism.

"I Like It…But Had Flaws I like the wooden name a lot. But, it had flaws. First, i had to sand the edges of the name because the edges weren’t smooth & pieces of wood were sticking out. (like wood tearout)<br />Second, I paid extra for it to be painted white. It was painted nicely besides the back of the dot that goes on the “i”. It was dirty & not painted. I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good. Just disappointing when you pay that much money & the product has these issues with it that i had to take the time to fix / edit to make it right.",Neutral

"Cute result but challenging to put up These giraffes are cute and quite large! They fill the space nicely. However- they are harder to put up  than they seem because each spot, eye, ear, etc is it’s own individual piece, and there is no shape or template to use. After a few attempts of trying to get them to look right by going freeform, I ended up tracing the shape of the necks on paper, then on the wall. Once I did that, it went by quickly and came out very cute.<br /><br />Also- your wall color will be the background of the giraffes. Our walls are a kind of peachy beige so it worked well, but it would probably look strange with other colors.",Neutral

"Poor quality for the price... It's pretty, but by the way this is described, and for $55, I had every reason to expect that although not sterling silver of course, that the main center piece of the necklace, would be of decent, durable quality... put together to sustain wearing the necklace. Instead, the center piece of the necklace, is thin mixed metal, with the faux turquoise glued on top of it, such that my fingernail goes in all around between 'stone' and thin metal to which it is glued, ie, it's likely to come off. This necklace center piece is the quality of Walmart costume jewelry, not bought in the jewelry section even. The faux turquoise and faux silver beading seems like it will sustain wearing without breaking, but the main event... the center piece is a major let down in quality. A faux stone glued onto very thin, mass produced template cut metal. I'm returning it, and will put $55 towards a better quality necklace.",Neutral

"Might be Too Lightweight These are really pretty earrings. The mother of pearl is so light and polished it looks like resin. I put these on to try and they felt great, like I wasn't even wearing earrings - except for the part where the back of the earring kept getting caught in my long hair and getting twisted. By the time I went to take these out, the back of one earring had twisted really terribly and it was weird to take it out because it wasn't smooth at all. I was able to push the back into shape, but now I'm worried about wearing these and getting bumped weirdly so that it squashes the back and makes taking the earring off difficult. I'll definitely wear these with caution moving forward.",Neutral
"It two pieces. Looks overlapped. Cute but not what expected! It’s cute yes but the name is separate from the ball. Making it looked overlapped and clearly a decal.  Had it just printed as one piece it would have looked much better. It looked so badly I ended up peeling the name off and placing the name under the ball. Also, when placing the name on the wall I had great difficulty getting it to separate from the backing paper.  I am a seasoned wall decal placer so it wasn’t my inexperience. So yes cute but not what I expected.",Neutral

"Beautiful craftsmanship but not sterling silver as described My daughter loved the design of this ear cuff and the way it sits on her ear. Craftsmanship itself is beautiful - hammered surface is quite attractive. The reason for a 3-star rating is that the items is announced as made of sterling silver and it turned out to be silver-plated at best. The cuff does not have a '925' imprint (or any other imprints); it has a metallic smell and reacts with a magnet albeit lightly, which it shouldn't if it were made of sterling silver. The seller may want to adjust the description of this item to reflect the real material it is made of, which crucial to know especially for a buyer with allergies as some metals can cause skin reactions.",Neutral

Would be better to put the number through the middle or higher.,Neutral
Smaller than shown These earrings are very tiny and much smaller than they show.  They are nice though.,Neutral
Eh. It’s pretty cute but thin and doesn’t seem like very good quality. It’s cheap so that’s not surprising but you can barely even feel the name on the metal which I assume means that it will eventually rub off to the point where you can no longer read the name anymore. My arm is very thin and the bracelet even looks incredibly thin on me. I wouldn’t buy it again unless it was a gift for a small child.,Neutral

It's very lightweight, which I love. But it seems overpriced for close to $40 at the time of this review. And the fleshy color of the stone doesn't look very nice with my own lighter skin tone at all. If it were a different stone it would be a better match for me, but still seems somewhat overpriced in my opinion. I love the idea and the sentiment though. But I don't necessarily recommend this color stone (with my skin tone) for this price.",Neutral

They're VERY thin in width, which is fine for a woman, if that's what you like, but I got them for my boyfriend and it just looks a bit odd on his wrist, especially with only one. It looks better when you combine more, but still, not what I was expecting. When I first opened them, I thought maybe it was a child's version of the bracelet because it didn't look like it would even fit my wrist. It did fit, but the handwoven part of the bracelet barely went around my wrist. On a man, this design covers the front of their wrist, and the string with the slipknot covers most of the back. Again, I love the look of these bracelets, I just wish they were a bit bigger in width.",Neutral

That being said I thought it would be a little more sparkly/shiny. It comes in gold also, and that appears to look more shiny on my computer, but doesn't go with my decor.  I've ordered a silver mat to put around it, and may bling it out with some little rhinestones, so hopefully with a little ""tweeking"" it will look better.

"Gorgeous decals but the adhesive doesn’t work very wrll I have to say the actual flower decals are gorgeous and look so luxurious. I’ve used premium decals from a very expensive site before and these are just a good a quality in terms of the look. The only reason I gave these 3 stars is because the adhesive was terrible. I installed them one afternoon and by the following morning they had all peeled off, rolling into themselves to the point where they couldn’t be reinstalled. I ended up using decals I had planned on using for another room and I stalled them using spray adhesive and they seemed to do the trick. Overall I would still recommend them because the look is beautiful and the quality is great, I would just recommend taking the extra step to use spray adhesive in order to secure them.",Neutral
"Good product; poor packaging Package was in a resealable bag but the top above the zip-lock was not heat sealed. It was put into an Amazon bag so in shipment the product got out and into the Amazon bag. None of the product went to waste, we were able to use it out of the Amazon bag straight into the bath. However, moisture got into the Amazon bag/product bag and we did not have any fizzy with the salt. The fragrance was still there, it was nice and pleasant smelling. Suggest the packaging be more study like this bottle we had to put it in. There are moisture chunks in the salt and that is okay. The price would be okay if the package was better.

Both heels had huge blisters. I couldn’t even put them back on for 2 weeks. I still like the way they look though, so I wear them sometimes when I know I won’t be walking or standing for long but I put clear bandaids on the spots where I got blisters before and try to walk slowly so they don’t come off exposing my skin to the shoes and the possibility of getting blisters or cuts again.

The wall I have it displayed on is a light gray, so it just doesn't go well.  It also has white marks that appear to be the base color prior to the blue in wear marks around the edges.  When I corresponded with them about it, they explained that the color is pale blue and the white scratching or rubs around the edge are for character.  I guess if you wanted to put it in a frame, the edges might not show.  The sign material and printing are fantastic, but the color is not what was expected and the customer support isn't very good!

Printed on photo paper! It's pretty nice for an image printed on photo paper but really shouldn't cost more than $5.00 for that reason.  If it was printed onto cardstock or something a little thicker it would be worth what I paid.  Would also be more attractive as a metal or canvas sign.

PVC can have various densities, allowing for some flexibility depending on the formula used. this holder feels ""spongey"" for lack of better description, as if it was made of some sort of foam. I did not bother to depress it sharply or fold it to test the limits of its durability, but the holder is slightly flexible.<br /><br />the finish is matte on all surfaces. quality-wise, it does not project a luxury item appearance or something ""Apple"" would carry as an accessory in their stores. the manufacturer could have done better, like ever so slightly rounding out the edges for softer tactile feel and less of a stamped out one.<br /><br />in the end, I returned this because for the price it wasn't worth worth it. $9.99 for something that feels a quarter of this price at best.",Neutral

The vinyl is pretty low quality and will crack before it tears or stretches.

Bummed! I am super bummed because I really love this shirt but it’s to small. I have ordered this brand before and I usually wear a medium but this one seems like it’s mislabeled. Fits like a small but I need a medium. I have other shirts that fit true to size in this brand so I wasn’t expecting this. Disappointed but It’s super cute! Size up,Neutral

Print is not vivid I wanted to love this towel but the print on it is not vivid and it’s kind of hard to see the cute detail. The towel is smaller but that’s fine. I was using it to put into a Christmas gift. I feared the receiver thought it was a cheap $5 gift but it cost $15. I believe I got free shipping so of course that has to be factored in.,Neutral

"Poor packaging I ordered this to make foot soaks for my business. The tea is nice and smells lovely, but packaging was horrible. The stopper lid was out of the bottle and tea was all over the bottom of the box. There was no shrink wrap or anything to seal the lid to the bottle, so it must have popped open during shipping. I ship products all the time for my business and could never imagine sending a product packaged this way to a customer.

"Slightly decieving While the print is fine, the image is much smaller than the pictures made it look. It's also not 8X10. It's more like 8X10.5 and it's not centered, which made it difficult to find a frame. I wound up using an 8X10 frame and just folding the bottom over slightly so it would fit. I also did not realize it would not come with a frame, although that's mostly my fault for not reading the whole item name, because all of the pictures show it already in a frame.",Neutral

"Address with arrow mailbox label I purchased 2 of the Large versions with my address & arrow on them. I cleaned my mailbox on both sides with the same item and let it dry. I followed the instructions-it wasn't hard and the Large was the perfect size for what I needed. The first one went on super easy and looks great. The second one was very difficult. The vinyl lettering wouldn't come off the sheet. Then I couldn't get it to stay on the mailbox and the lettering ripped. I even used a special Cricut tool to smooth it on & still it didn't work. I know this happens when using vinyl sometimes, but still I was very disappointed. The one that worked looks fantastic.",Neutral

It shamelessly stated on the invoice that I payed shipping for BOTH orders which were delivered in ONE shipping box.

The vinyl letters don't appear to have had a sealant sprayed over them and the plaque is very thin.  This is NOT a sign meant for an exposed area...definitely needs to be on a covered porch with protection from moisture.<br /><br />Those who are crafty could simply buy a black plaque from the craft store with 40-50% off coupon, press-on letters from the dollar store, and make it for far less.",Neutral

"JUST SPEND EXTRA 10.00S AND GET A QUALITY ONE! THIS METAL IS THINNER THEN DOLLAR TREE METAL SIGNS AND IS NOT MADE OF QUALITY METAL!!<br />It arrived quickly in a very thin flat box. Some edging of words are not only sharp enough to get you some stitches, but a piece was actually bend upwards.. (hey makers... thanks, I missed the ER, 1st time stitches were horrid). It could've been avoided by the makers simple act of flattening this LITTLE MORE THAN PAPER THIN metal.<br /> I am just not pleased with this product.  The cutting machine is off a little and leaves jagged edges, which wasn't mentioned that it would be this way on every cut their machine made.<br /> I wanted to like it, but when it hit the floor, it gave a bit and bent a tad now won't lay flush with wall.

"It is as described but I didn't read the description I can't totally fault this for being just a picture on paper and not a wood block or canvas because it says that in the description, but the first picture for the advertising is pretty misleading, so will take off points for that. Not worth $12 in the end, but it still looks nice if you frame it. Overal 5/10, would recommend at a lower price.",Neutral
It was okay for the most part This product is 3d printed so it's not the most reliable or durable. I only use it about once a week for a few hours and the second one I orders broke again.,Neutral
"Beautiful earrings, but not real chrysoprase Beautiful earrings. I bought them because I lost one of my beloved chrysoprase earrings and these looked nearly identical so I thought I could replace it.<br /><br />They’re gorgeous. BUT I don’t think they’re real chrysoprase (which I kind of already suspected based on the price). I paid $250 an earring (so $500 for the pair) for my original chrysoprase earrings. The color of those is super vibrant and if you do a quick search for chrysoprase jewelry you’ll see that it doesn’t run under $180, $200 apiece.

"Tiny The amethyst ring is really pretty, but the description says it is a size 5, and it barely fits my fingers. My ring finger is a size 3.5 (which is tiny enough as it is), and this ring is so tight I’m afraid to leave it on incase my fingers swell I’m sure I would not be able to get it off.

For example If the band is white the engraving should be another color like for example black so it can stand out, it should be an option that the buyer can choose. Seller I hope you’re reading this because there’s no point in buying this product if the engraving can’t be seen. 👎 NOT SATISFIED! Also the M/L band needs to be longer with more holes.",Neutral

"Not Concrete sheet, made entirly of wood. It's not actually concrete sheet like listing states. It's painted plywood which was a bit disappointing. Other reviewers stated the same letdown.

I explained and he asked me what does he need to do with this... Excuse him for he is sinned to be non pintetester!!! Shocking!!!

My arm was 15 inches around and this thing is painfully tight. Too tight to use right now (my husband is using it and he loves it). I may have measured too low, but it said &#34;bicep&#34; and that's where I measured so I don't know. I can tell that I am going to love it once it fits.

"Doesn't look gold plated. I was very disappointed when i received the necklace, because it looks better on the pictures here than in person. Doesn't even look like a good gold plated quality.

Expected More Cute -- but very thin ...spend the extra money to buy leather or a better quality label,Neutral
"Cute, but only for people with tough calloused feet! They look good, but they hurt my feet. There is no padding in the soles at all so it’s like walking barefoot. And they scratched my heels pretty badly! I had to put bandaids on my heels after only 5 minutes of wearing them, before I even left the house. But that didn’t matter it was already too late. Both heels had huge blisters. I couldn’t even put them back on for 2 weeks. I still like the way they look though, so I wear them sometimes when I know I won’t be walking or standing for long but I put clear bandaids on the spots where I got blisters before and try to walk slowly so they don’t come off exposing my skin to the shoes and the possibility of getting blisters or cuts again. I wish they were a little better quality because they are super cute and I get lots of compliments on how they look, I just can’t recommend them to anyone because they are so uncomfortable.",Neutral

"It's really pretty but fade quickly. I got to admit, I first thought it's going to be a small heart rose quartz, turned out the size was perfect and its beautiful. I wear this everyday but of course I took it off before I showered. Very nice jewelry though but there's better options, this works fine until it is completely faded. A crystal was nice so replace the chain wasn't a problem. 👍",Neutral

I was willing to pay the extra money because having these personalized meant a lot to me, and because I saw it was a small business, but the cost does not make sense given the quality unfortunately.

Disappointed I’ve ordered these masks before and really liked them. My last order the elastic ear loops were stretched out and they didn’t fit as well as previous ones. Very disappointed.,Neutral
Not what I ordered. I think the craftsmanship is great and the details of the wheels moving are really nice. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because it was 1 month late getting here and I paid for pegs on my daughter's name. It didn't come with that. I don't like the trains and I never got to customize that.

I love the style and the concept I love the style and the concept. It really does glow in the dark!!! The down size is that its not real silver and tarnishes very fast.

"Marginal Engraving We purchased four of these (for two different residences).  They look nice and delivery was prompt. I’ve deducted two stars because the engraving is too shallow.

"... to the plastic coated material that it is (although easy to clean) The cloth itself is quite lovely -- though I would have preferred cloth material to the plastic coated material that it is (although easy to clean). I give it 3 stars because it has no zipper or snaps to take the cloth off the umbrella table. As it is, one would have to take the umbrella out of the table each time you put the cloth on the table and each time you take it off.  I cut the cloth and will have the tailor put either snaps or a zipper on it. I bought two of these cloths in different colors -- really like them both, except for this nuisance.

"Really cute decor pieces, but has errors! These decor pieces are really nice looking and they look lovely on the wall. It's a four piece set that you can use together or spread in different areas. The boards aren't too thick, nor too thin. They have little flappy hinges on each board to hang these on a picture nail, so the damage to a wall is minimal.<br /><br />The major issue for me is the missing punctuation and missing words on two plaques. The first one that says ""This is us"" has words underneath that says, ""Our life. Our story. Our home"" It's missing the period after home, which really bothers me. The other one says, ""Bless this"" then underneath it says, ""And all who enter"". It's missing the word 'home' which is a HUGE error! I feel if a company is going to make beautifully decorated decor items, they would at least check their grammatical issues. These errors stick out like a sore thumb and is rather aggravating.<br /><br />Overall, these are beautiful plaques and they would look beautiful on the wall. Due to the missing punctuation and word, I don't think I can keep these on my wall. I really hope the company fixes these errors so I can get another set because they're beautiful, well-made, and would look lovely in my living room. If these two errors don't bother you, then these will be worth buying. If errors bother you, like they do me, I don't suggest buying these decor pieces. I guess it all comes down to your personal preference.",Neutral
Only for people with small ear lobes Really like these. I would have given 5 stars if the part that goes into the ear was longer for larger ear lobes.,Neutral

My granddaughter's name is spelled Kassadee and I was worried that they wouldn't be able to place her name very well into the design, but it worked.<br />It's not a bad product, but when planning a room design, most walls will dwarf this product so you might want to accompany this with something.",Neutral

"It's cute, but it's not real Lapis Lazuli If you're buying this necklace because you're hoping for the properties of Lapis Lazuli, (or just want a piece of actual lapis in general) you're out of luck - this is most likely a dyed composite with mica flecks added in this very convenient shape that fits the stone.  (see microscope photo - flecks of blue dye = not actually blue.)<br /><br />(nerd talk:  Real lapis Lazuli has a Mohs hardness of 5-6, which means while a stone of higher hardness would be able to scratch it, but it will resist scratches from anything lower than 5 on the Mohs scale.  with a piece of calcite--Mohs hardness 3-- I easily scratched a line into it.  That would not be physically possible with actual lapis.)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this isn't pretty.  It is.  the chain and bail are simple, and suit the stone well.  It all looks very nice.  But the fact that they're lying about it being genuine and preying on people with all the talk of how it ""helps complete your beauty and chakra""  (actual quote from the packaging)  That's gross.  Just sell it as a lovely handmade necklace.  People will pay for that.  It's a cute set.<br /><br />A quick look into the company shows that they've applied in Greece for a patent for ""Jewelry and imitation jewelry.""  Make of that what you will.  I recommend buying an equally pretty inexpensive stone from someone who's not lying to you about what it is.<br /><br />PS.  Dat not hematite either.",Neutral

The clasp broke of the chain. I lost the necklace in the parking lot at our club house.  I was lucky to have found it the next day after back tracking my steps.  The clasp was gone from the chain. The artist had also placed the date on wrong side and broke up the sentiment.,Neutral
"Lack of protective shipping Super cute, came before expected, but one of the letters was peeling off and there was absolutely no packing paper or anything in the box, just the pumpkin.",Neutral

"It is a bit short but works, barely This is a bit short for my standard issue 1950's ceramic toilet paper embedded dispenser.  So although it does work it is loose since the spring loaded part of it never activates so there is no tension and it is the spring tension which keeps these things firmly held in the dispenser.  It will do for now, but I will try to find another one that is a bit longer.  I am searching for wooden only as I try not to buy  in plastic.",Neutral
"Very nice, but too large These shoes are awesome. The soles are very quiet so I don’t wake up my family early in the morning. I ordered a half size down, but they are still too large, which is really really annoying. And I can’t return to Lithuania. Maybe I can find someone to give them to so I can order another pair.",Neutral
"Cute, but misleading Very cute! It shows that you can put something on the bottom, but when it was time to check out, I was only able to put a name on the top. I wish I could have put the date on the bottom. This was very misleading.",Neutral
Tiny charm Not bad. Very small. Approximately the size of a dime. It looks ok though. But definitely smaller than it seems in the picture.,Neutral

Beautiful but lousy chain Absolutely beautiful pendant. Daughter loved it. But chain was very weak and broke almost immediately.,Neutral
"Rottie Sticker The sticker is cute, and it arrived quickly. I tore one edge slightly when I was separating the backing. It is sticking well but definitely has some bubbles, that I can’t get out. It could simply be because it rained later on the day I applied it, plus I tore the edge slightly. Or it could be the humidity of Fl.",Neutral

"It wraps around wrist several times I really wanted to love this Boho Wrap Bracelet, but I could not. I knew that it wrapped around your wrist as stated in the description of the product, but I did not like how it wrapped around my wrist. It crisscrossed over itself and felt odd when I rested my wrist on it. It wrapped around my wrist several times and didn't feel comfortable to me. It is beautiful and looks lovely, and if having it crisscrossed doesn't bother you then try it, but it is not for me.",Neutral

"Small, dainty, but meaningful So my fiancé got me 3 of these rings for Christmas, they sent me the wrong birthstone. I emailed and got the correct ring, but they’re great rings, I wear them all the time and have yet to get a green finger. Small, dainty, but so meaningful.",Neutral
"Love the earrings but very disappointed in the color! I love the shape and size of these earrings. I was disappointed however, because even though I knew they would not be real rubies, the description and the online picture led me to believe they would be red. Instead they are a pink color. I had ordered them to wear with a red outfit and they did not look good with it at all.",Neutral
Hurts I love the minimalist design and the small diameter as they’re hard to find but it SO difficult to put it in. It looks very pretty overall but it HURTS when I tried to put it in the way they said. I feel like these ate meant to used only on earlobes not on cartilages. So I had to open the hoop the way I wasn’t supposed to. I guess the beauty comes with the pain. My other concern is that a little opening on the hoop might get stuck with hair too. I wish there was another way to make these cute hoops.,Neutral

"Shipping from Canada Great stickers for keeping track of routines.  The shipping time was super long so if you need something ASAP, i recommend finding something else.",Neutral
Beautiful but beware! The softness and durability of this quilt is exceptional BUT the stitching stated at both long ends and ended in the middle with long strings unsecured as if someone forgot to tie them off.  I had to spend the time tying them before washing to make sure the stitching would not come apart in the wash.  If it was finished then 5 stars!,Neutral
"Underwhelmed The pros are that it came SUPER fast, and it's very detailed and unique. The cons are that it feels kinda cheap, it's very thin and the edges are a little pokey, not very substantial, I feel like I could snap it in half really easily. It's for sure not worth the price, especially when it costs extra to add a chain, which is just ridiculous. I'm still gonna wear it, but I was kind of hoping for more from this necklace.",Neutral
"Cheaper quality than it looks Pretty, but stains your skin green.",Neutral
Clock too small Wish it was BIGGER and maybe even all parts working. Craftsman ship is good.,Neutral
"SMALL Not what I expected, it’s very very small and the chain is plastic, something you’d get out of a bubble gum machine.<br />I bought this for my daughter in law and was embarrassed to give it to her.<br />For the money I spent, I expected something a little more, had so many other options to buy from other vendors, I regret buying from this one and would not recommend.",Neutral
The lettering is easily rubbed off. I liked the colour and the font. I did not like how easily the lettering was erased. I cannot touch the bottles constantly as the letters will be rubbed off. This is very disappointing.,Neutral
"Letters look great! The letters of this decal are very nice. The problem is with the installation. I followed the instructions but the letters stuck to the backing and not the clear mounting strip. I had to peel the letter off the backing, smooth out the bubbles and wrinkles, make sure they were aligned properly on the mounting strip, then stick on the letters. It took much longer than I expected but I think it looks nice for this chair I made for my grandson.",Neutral
Cute idea Great idea for all the back ordered stuff.  The reel won’t last to long. So I have decided to keep it to the side for the idea and to show. More as a gag gift.,Neutral

"The chain for this piece of jewelry can tangled up which was very frustrating and disappointing. The piece is itself is quite beautiful.  The chain is more flimsy than I would have expected.  Even worse it came tangled.  This piece is intended as a gift.  Luckily, I opened the box to check it before giving it.  It would have been very embarrassing to give a gift that was unusable.

"Only one line of hearts Cute decal, and seems to be of good quality. It came with some nice directions for applying to a wall (also mentions car, but not laptop, even though the listing shows a picture of it on a laptop).<br /><br />The main problem is that the listing of the product is misleading: You get one line of 10 hearts, despite the picture of 10 lines of 10 hearts and the title saying (10). It implies that the &#34;Health Bar&#34; is one whole line - I mean, really, a health bar is a unit of multiple hearts! - and that I'm getting 10 bars. I'm very disappointed at the price, considering this. I thought the price was fair for 10 lines, but wouldn't have ordered it if I had understood the listing properly.<br /><br />Still cute and glad to have it on my laptop.",Neutral

"Very lightweight My husband likes this so far and hopefully it will keep his things together.  I have to say that I was disappointed for the price. The wood is essentially very light plywood and not very substantial. If he just has his phone on top (heavy case) it will tip over. The personalization also isn't as dark and doesn't stand out as much as I would like. It's personalized, so we have it, but it's not as I expected.",Neutral

This bracelet came off a number of times while working. sometimes I would bump the clasp just right to pop it off or I was stocking things and would shake it loose. There are lost of cases I can see this not being an issue. maybe an office job or going to school, probably wont have it fall off as often or at all.",Neutral

"Sounds enticing I was thinking whipped soap, sounds lovely. Until I used it. The soap clumps & is not whipped. Doesn’t melt well or lather up easily.

They are ok They don't really sparkle much. I received the larger size and its still a little small for me. Would be good for a second or third hole. The screw on back is a nice feature and would be great for little ones so they don't take the earring out by accident.,Neutral

"Good luck I’m not sure how much it is me vs the quality of vinyl/transfer paper but this application couldn’t have gone worse had I tried. The stripes went on flawlessly, the stars are an utter disaster. Nothing but creases throughout the entire star field. I’ve installed vinyl in the past without any issues. This was the worst application I’ve ever had. Nothing like having to scrape off a brand new decal. 3 stars simply because I could 100% be at fault here, I don’t know why it went so poorly.",Neutral

"Do NOT buy if you have even slightly textured walls! This is NOT good for even slightly textured walls. We just spent over three hours trying to apply these, most have torn, have air bubbles or applied very crooked. They were popping off the wall in places I fill like this should have been mentioned in the product description and I would have by-passed all together. Very unhappy that I just wasted $75. Fuming!<br />Update: Adjusted my rating because the company has great customer service. Stickers are super cute but I still don’t suggest for textured walls.",Neutral
Three Stars a bit expensive for item,Neutral
"Fun retro memory of the raisins The printing is not vivid and not well defined and the fabric is very light weight and so I will have to wear a camo or sports bra under it so I don't feel like I have a see-through shirt on.  I will not be wearing it often, but it is a great walk down memory lane and I love that I see it in my drawer.  I have collected all the raisins figures and still love the song.",Neutral
"Not real copper spring!!! First of all, I want to start off by saying that the energy of this orgone is AMAZING! The moonstones are real! I really love moonstone and it’s energy, when I first received it and opened the box, I layed down and closed my eyes as I unboxed it, using sense of touch. I then placed the the pyramid over my third eye and just breath in it’s energy, for about 30 seconds. Then I held the pyramid in my left hand, I am right handed, but I did what felt right. I began to meditate with it, I wanted to feel it’s energy, for what it is, and not judge it based on how it looks, if it’s sloppy made or something is not straight or any of that, that doesn’t really matter if your buying this for a metaphysical purpose. Don’t forget why you’re buying it! Is it to look cool or pretty, or do you want to receive the benefits of a pyramid in your life ?<br />As, I began to meditate with it, I can feel a big vibration of energy! I felt as if my body was being filled with this energy and as it got down in my legs and to my toes it made my toes twitch, and move where I wasn’t doing that! I just remained calm and welcomed the energy. The experience was amazing! The energy was throbbing in my hand as I held it. When I was done with my meditation I thanked it and it made me smile I felt so happy, I gently opened my eyes and took a look at it. Right away I was able to tell the moonstone was real, I was surprised with how big the clear quartz was. Another thing I noticed was the quality of the resin. I compared this to 2 other pyramids I purchased. One, was cheaper in price, the other one, I believe is a competitor to evervibes, and the particular orogone that I bought from the competitive brand was more expensive than this one, yet, the resin felt the cheapest out of the 3!<br />The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is because it is really disappointing to me that the copper they use if fake. I took pictures of the spring wrapped around the clear quartz and you can definitely see discoloration, as if it was painted to look like copper. That is really upsetting, because of what you pay for an orgone like this, you pay for genuine stone and you trust that the company would deliver on that and on claiming they use “copper” not copper color wire, which takes from the metaphysical benefits, that some of us really care about.<br />Aside from that, I could not return this item because it’s energy is too beautiful and positive, I have meditated a couple other times with it, like I did when I first received it, and every time, I feel the throbbing sensation in my hand that holds it and every time I feel a pull of energy all the way down to my toes, this is some powerful stuff here! I keep next to where I sleep and sometimes hold it to fall asleep and then I’ll put it back on my nightstand once I catch myself sleeping and it had changed my dreams. I have been able to correlate them more and understand my subconscious more, of why I’m having certain dreams and I’m intuitively able to interpret them, it’s a little crazy! But, I know it’s the moonstone aiding my intuition.<br />So, if you want the real vibe and experience of a moonstone orgone, and you don’t care about not having the copper benefits, this is it! You won’t regret it. I know I don’t! But, nobody likes feeling cheated either.<br />I personally wouldn’t gift this, since the copper is so obvious that is not real and also, if you look at the picture I posted of the bottom of the pyramid and you look at the logo of evervibes you can see that the “e” first letter of the brand fell off, this happened quite early since I got it, maybe 3 weeks in. But, I do hold it a lot in my sleep and place the bottom on my forehead for a minute each night, so it can be that also.",Neutral

"They are tiny I was disappointed in the size - they are tiny - but my own fault because I neglected to look at the size and only looked at the picture.

It's ok I was really disappointed in this.  It's just a heavier gauge of paper that it's printed on.  Not really worth the price.  I'll keep it but keep shopping around for better quality.,Neutral

"Double check your order I really want to give it 5 stars. I ordered this for my sister for her birthday. The overall quality of the product is great. It arrived in a timely manner. Nothing was misspelled. However, the placement of where I wanted things was off. I ordered ""Fierce"" on the top and then her birthday in Roman numerals on the side. When it arrived, it was engraved top and bottom. So you could only see one of them when it's being worn. I was really disappointed with that! I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and waiting for a new one that MIGHT have turned out right, so I just gave it to her anyway.

Larger than they look in the pics Nothing wrong with them. It just that the pieces are larger in person then they look on the pictures. Thought they'd be smaller and more dainty but that's not the case.,Neutral
Flat and awkward The patch is extremely flat and presses against the eye. After a lot of kneading the leather was softer but still had zero shape. I've bought leather patches before and knew it would be stiff but no amount of weasel make this item comfortable. The stud holding the strap is centered on the forehead. No getting around that. The adjustable strap was the only thing about it that I have no qualms with. The details were lightly etched into the leather and weren't easily seen but I'd rather have had nothing at all.,Neutral

Item arrived well packaged - a bit over packaged if I’m being honest, and came with a printed receipt and postcard sized thank you card, which was nice.<br /><br />Product itself however, looked like it had been printed on a home laser printer on low, grade copier paper. Colors themselves were also not very vivid.<br /><br />I purchased this item for reference when editing photographs and also for just having a handy at-a-glance guide for color coordinating around the home. It will provide me with the ability to do that, I just feel a bit short-changed given I paid $23 for a piece of poorly printed, laminated paper.<br /><br />Item cannot be returned either, so consider carefully before purchasing.",Neutral

"Some are photos and not real pages I have been purchasing these to use as covers for the back panel of an inexpensive bookcase to give it a fun twist. For my purposes it is fine, but some are real dictionary pages, and some are photos (several are copies of the exact same page).

"Well... It is what it is. Not a forever piece of jewelry, definitely for a younger teen to enjoy and eventually set aside for more grown up stuff. So for it's ""Sweet 16"" purpose, it is fun. If it gets lost no big deal. If it tarnishes no big deal. Cute and well made. I only wish we had a choice in the stone because I would've liked her birthstone, so, I did have to go on my own to replace the pearl with the correct birthstone, which brought the final price paid quite higher than I really wanted to pay for a gift to someone's child whom I hardly know.

Poor quality Printed on photo paper and was a little blurry and difficult to read. I was hoping for something nicer than I could have done myself.

Stones fell out after a week Even though shipping to a while when I received the item I was so in love. i also love the little nose jewelry box it was sent in. I love wearing different nose rings rather then standard ones and I was happy to fine a couple on Amazon. How ever I'm disappointed because I've only had the nose ring in for 1-2 weeks and all of the stones fell out. When I change my rings I like to wear then for months before changing to another but since this has happened I have to take it out. Would I purchase again ? No because 'm afraid the stones will fall out again and to me it was a waste of my money. I do hope the seller fix this issue.,Neutral
"Real leather, well made,  but disappointed in the appearance I really wanted to like this potentially cute little, genuine leather bag, but I was disappointed in the look of the leather.<br />Pros:<br />1) genuine leather--smells good, feels real.<br />2) Good size if you just want to carry a phone and minimalist wallet<br />3) very nice, swivel, high-quality clips for strap<br />4) Could work for men or women who want a small/non-bulky pouch for essentials.<br />Cons:<br />1) The leather on the face of the bad just looks....ugly to me.  See pic 1 and 2. The colors of the different pieces are not a great match, the place where the snap is has a lump and looks kind of cheap or worn.... and the overall look of the front is, to me, kind of ugly rather than the pleasingly distressed look that leather can develop and was hoping for.  Possibly, with time and use, we will get a nicer patina and it will look more integrated and attractive.  I may also try some mink oil to even out the shades.  If any of this works over time, I will update review and add a star.<br />2) Given the disappointing appearance of the bag, I think it is priced too high.",Neutral
Cute but too thin... Needs to have a thicker material used.,Neutral
NOT FRAMED OR MOUNTED These are nice images. They look as they appear in the pictures. The seller did a good job of advertising by adding a drop-shadow that gives them the appearance of being mounted but be aware that these are just PRINTS on glossy cardstock.<br /><br />it's easy enough to go to a craft store and mount them on some balsa wood or something like that.

Pretty Bracelet- Engraving Not As Expected The bracelet is pretty and came very fast in a very nice gift box. The downside is there is no insert to explain what kind of stones the bracelet is made of which would be nice considering this is a gift.  I thought the engraving would look like the picture of the bracelet that I ordered but instead it was a black letter M — nota cursive M in silver.  It’s confusing when ordering- you aren’t sure exactly which bracelet is which and what you are ordering. It could definitely be more clear.,Neutral

"Disappointed, Description NOT Accurate I've been wanting to purchase a grasshopper keychain for a while to remind me that ""I'm not a grasshopper"".  I saw this keychain on Amazon and love the hand stamped, rustic look of the item.  The description reads ""Grasshopper charm keychain with HAND STAMPTED initial"".  As you can tell from the photo I attached the initial is NOT hand stamped.  The initial piece isn't even the same piece that was shown in the listing photo.  It makes the keychain look cheaper and not as nice.  The initial piece is a smooth, mirrored piece of metal with a a ""T"" printed on it.  I would not have been willing to pay what I paid for this unit, it I had seen it as it really is.  I will be writing to Amazon to see about getting a partial or full refund.",Neutral

"and they are great for that purpose I got these to use as cloth napkins, and they are great for that purpose. They clean up well in the washing machine.

Not worth what I paid I'm not happy but not disappointed. It's smaller than I anticipated but not by much but the stones are terrible. In the description they looked higher quality. They look like fish rocks.<br />I wouldn't have minded had I not spent $13 it's definitely not worth that.<br />The grid is printed on thin flimy card stock material and the rocks mine came with were tiny which I didn't mind much but I don't see how something tiny could break in half my picture it's hard to tell but one of the stones came broken too.<br />I am going to use this for an arts and craft project otherwise I would have returned it.

"Eh, it’s alright I like the packaging the case came in. It was a very cute holographic pouch that included a sort of tether for the AirPods in case you do some strenuous activity and you don’t want to risk losing them (as easily at least). I will say I do also like the material the case is made of. It’s a thick pvc plastic material; It’s not a hard case, but it also isn’t completely loose. The fit on my case is nice. It’s very snug, but I haven’t tried taking it off for any reason. It might be such a tight fit that I could see it being very difficult to slide the AirPod case out without any struggle.<br />Now, reviewing the printed font on the front is what I have the most issue with. As you can tell from the pictures, it is very off center. My name is very far to the left and I feel like it throws the whole aesthetic completely off. It could’ve been a cute minimalistic case, but for those such as myself the off center name is all I see. I also don’t care too much for the actual font. It doesn’t seem as elegant as the pictures I saw, but I guess that’s just because my name doesn’t start with an ‘s’ or another less awkward letter lol.

"Oily on My Skin, Takes Long Time to Absorb This order includes three unscented lotion sticks. I gave these to my wife, and here is her review:  Because the top is flat and not rounded, there are a limited number of body parts where I can apply this until the stick gets worn down and rounded a bit on the edges. I applied this to the back of my hands, and then used my hands to finish rubbing it in. My hands stayed oily for a long time, which I didn't care for. I had other things to do, but didn't want to get oily prints all over everything I touched, so I basically took an unplanned break until the oiliness was gone. It seemed to take forever, but part of that was probably because I was impatient to get back to what I was working on. One strange result from this lotion stick was that it made my hands really wrinkly, especially around my thumbs. No idea why. I didn't see anything in the ingredient list that would explain it. It did leave my skin soft and moisturized, so I will use it until it's gone, but at this price, with the very slow absorption time, and with the oddball wrinkling effect, I don't want any more of it.",Neutral

Feels soft and ""rustic"", the leather is thick but pliable.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe the leather will form over time, but the pen loop prevents the cover to close evenly. Doesn't look good as it is right now. The pen loop is rather tight and will only fit very slim pens like Parker Jotter. Anything larger and you will have to force the pen in and out. I got ink on my fingers trying to work a Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen out of the loop and the cap came off instead.<br /><br />Also, the cover is quite a bit larger than the A6 notebook itself, but it has to be to fit a pen in the middle and not interfere with closing.

The Peridot is Pretty These are nice earrings but the stone is slightly smaller than the setting. There is a small gap between the stone and the edge of the setting. It seems as if the stone might be glued on the setting.<br /><br />The backs are very small and it was hard to get them on. I bent the post during the struggle. It did pass the magnetic test so it is sterling silver.<br /><br />I don't think they will hold up to daily wear and I certainly would not sleep in them.,Neutral

"Sturdy bracelet It says it’s made out of obsidian, tigereye, and blue tigereye stone. I’m not not convinced it is all real, real stones are cool to the touch, have weight to them, and have imperfections. The tiger eye feels cool to the touch but the obsidian does not. In the product specifications it says the gem type is marcasite. Blue tiger eye is normally a deeper blue but these are a more teal blue. The bracelet dose however feel sturdy.",Neutral

OK but not worth the money We purchased these custom magnets for two rooms for a cruise we went on in September. One magnet arrived correct the other arrived with incorrect spelling (I fixed it with a Sharpie). On the cruise the size and weight of the sign caused the magnet to fail on both signs. We ended up taping to our doors. Quality not worth the price.,Neutral
Better quality control needed Attention to detail is lacking. There was a lot of sticky residue around the vinyl sticker and a small piece in one of the corners that was not cut completely that I had to remove with tweezers.

I gave this armband a 3 out of 5 because I was looking for one that I can quickly slide my phone in and out during runs.

I love it!!!)<br /><br />The ONLY issue that I have with this product is that the case comes in two piece: A case and a cap (or top).<br />They are not connected and the top falls off *really* easily.

She told me to forget it and she would superglue it and make it work. Somehow I’m not here to bash the vendor but it’s a little odd that you would request a photograph opening it when someone’s reaching out about Damage. Clearly already opened it.

Framed it in an 11 x 14 Black Picture frame cream matted to 8 x 10. Only gave a three rating because the picture gets washed out.  I am going to try a double edged colored matting to see if it will emphasize this piece.  With this nice piece of art, it would be better if it were printed on linen ruffled stock paper with serrated edge and then it could be so nicely mounted for display.

Beware of Fonts First off buyer beware of the fonts used for personalization.  I ordered 5 of these personalized Yetti's for Christmas gifts.  Four of the five were perfect but the fifth one turned out horrible because of the font that was used.  The name on the fifth one should have read McKenzey but because of the font style used it came out MaKenzey.  Very disappointing.  I notified seller of this and they did offer to re-do it. I chose to keep the tumbler as is and not return it for a re-do because it was a Christmas gift.  Before you order you might want to see what kind of font will be used.  The picture shows all five tumblers.  You can clearly see the difference in the style of font and size used.  McKenzey's tumbler is in the middle.,Neutral

"Great scent, but leaves hair waxy I didn’t see any other reviews having this problem, so maybe it’s because of my specific hair texture (I have very thick and wavy hair) or maybe it’s the way I’m using it, but everytime I’ve used it so far it’s left my hair feeling very waxy. I’ve been using it for a few weeks, and I thought at first the wax residue was because it was a new bar and that happens sometimes. But even after several uses my hair still feels waxy afterwards. I’ve tried using less, tried rinsing it for longer, and even tried not using conditioner afterwards in case if it was my conditioner that wasn’t mixing well with it. My hair still feels waxy and I can see literal pieces of it in my hairbrush. I’ve been experimenting with different brands of shampoo bars and haven’t been able to find one that I really like. I thought this one would be it since it seemed to use very natural ingredients, but this one has been my least favorite so far. The only thing I like about it as that the smell is great!",Neutral

There is no reason I should have to spend the amount of time getting the chain apart from itself.<br />Another huge issue is two weeks later I notice when I went to put the necklace on it seemed to be tarnished a bit on the WW piece. It had been hanging up alone and there is no reason in two weeks it should be 'tarnished' so quickly. It's sterling but I have had pieces that sit for months and months that don't need cleaned. I have fake pieces even that don't change.<br />This wasn't a 10 or 20 dollar piece. If I hadn't waited so very long for this piece and had such high hopes and didn't pay over 30 dollars for it I wouldn't be so harsh on my review. But I was so excited about this for so long to get this for myself for so many reasons and for it not to be better quality upon arrival is very disappointing.,Neutral
Too small for men Beautiful bracelet and well made. The problem is that the men’s size is for a small boy at best. I think the vendor made these for women instead. I wish they would be made to fit my wrist like the other bracelets I bought from this vendor.,Neutral
one good one leaked got 2 for my girls who are in gymnatics as a suprise. both came on time and looked fine my 9 yr old only got to use hers once and on her way to gymnasytics the bottom of her s was leaking. not sure if it was just a default but she was really upset. git should have made it more than one day. everything in her bag was soaked. i would love a replacment bc she really loved it.,Neutral

"Don’t buy it’s a scam. I laughed when I got this ring.  Because the stones are fake for one & the other they are so small you can hardly see them.

The wrapping around the fake stones covers part of the fake stones because of how small they are.  Terrible product, terrible.",Neutral

Nice but don't pay extra for sparkles!

Nice but not convient for galaxy S8 The quality is good.  Love the design.

"Not for large buns I have waist length  hair and like to wear in a bun.

Very nice quality product that was shipped very quickly Ordered on Last Monday and received at my door the following Thursday.  Not bad service for an item shipping from Europe.  Item is nice and well crafted and fits my new 12.9 iPad Pro 2018 w/ keyboard folio perfectly. Also includes pocket for Apple Pencil.  Leather side is very nice and felt side is nice and thick. Very good quality.<br /><br />Scratches way to easily. Not happy.,Neutral
"Cute ring I was a little disappointed when I received this ring. No problem with sizing. It’s a prettier thing in pictures than real life. It’s a bit rough around the edges of the name area. It’s smaller than I expected. It doesn’t snag or get in the way or stuck on clothing, which is an upside. Maybe if it were sterling silver or white gold it would be better, dressier? I can’t put my finger on exactly why I’m not happy with it, it just didn’t “wow” me when I opened it, wore it or now. It’s not horrible, it’s just ehhh 🤷🏻‍♀️",Neutral
"Not as expected The pattern looks just printed on and they epoxy over it. I was expecting actually pieces to make it look like a mosaic. It’s okay quality and overall is fine, but was majority disappointed at how basic it looked after opening it. Not worth the money In my opinion.",Neutral

"It's cute, but it's not real Lapis Lazuli If you're buying this necklace because you're hoping for the properties of Lapis Lazuli, (or just want a piece of actual lapis in general) you're out of luck - this is most likely a dyed composite with mica flecks added in this very convenient shape that fits the stone.  (see microscope photo - flecks of blue dye = not actually blue.)<br /><br />(nerd talk:  Real lapis Lazuli has a Mohs hardness of 5-6, which means while a stone of higher hardness would be able to scratch it, but it will resist scratches from anything lower than 5 on the Mohs scale.  with a piece of calcite--Mohs hardness 3-- I easily scratched a line into it.  That would not be physically possible with actual lapis.)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this isn't pretty.  It is.  the chain and bail are simple, and suit the stone well.  It all looks very nice.  But the fact that they're lying about it being genuine and preying on people with all the talk of how it ""helps complete your beauty and chakra""  (actual quote from the packaging)  That's gross.  Just sell it as a lovely handmade necklace.  People will pay for that.  It's a cute set.<br /><br />A quick look into the company shows that they've applied in Greece for a patent for ""Jewelry and imitation jewelry.""  Make of that what you will.  I recommend buying an equally pretty inexpensive stone from someone who's not lying to you about what it is.<br /><br />PS.  Dat not hematite either.",Neutral
I can't get a good grip. I guess I could do a little ... It is a decent product.  It doesn't really work well for me.  The place where I put my hand is too thick.  I can't get a good grip.<br />I guess I could do a little whittling around that area to thin it out so my grip it tight.,Neutral

"Beautiful Ring, Poor Color Change So, I received this ring last night. I was excited as it was a beautiful ring, the cut of the gems are beautiful and the rose gold, though not super polished looking, looks more matte but I actually love that. My one BIG disappointed and the reason for the 3 stars is the color of the stone. I knew at night it would look more red/pinkish but I expected it to look more blue/green or at least blue violet in daylight... It only looks like a deep purple in full sun. The color change is pitiful and I am considering returning if possible. I'll give it some time to see if I'm able to live with the poor color change.

"Beautiful craftsmanship, questionable B2C relations [[VIDEOID:726482394375e57f308f22f81eee3140]] I love these earrings. I purchased them back in January and posted a quick video on my IG stories to encourage some of my friends to purchase, in which I received confirmation that three people did! I posted a photo on my feed today, wearing my earrings and tagged the company (received DMs asking about my beautiful jewels as I also posted an IG story boomerang), looks like I was suddenly blocked by the company, which was quite alarming! Nonetheless, I love my earrings, I hope there is no malice between myself and whomever runs their social accounts. As a PR professional, I can say that it is counterproductive to block customers if loyal business is desired. Simply removing the tag from the post will suffice, or messaging the customer for removal to preserve aesthetics.

"Smells nice; lotion was rusty I am the recipient, this was gifted to me by my husband. It was a super sweet gift for my first mother's day and one of several things he got me. The candle smells nice. The lip balm is moisturizing and has a nice scent. The matches are convenient, I guess, if you don't have a lighter for candles. I haven't tried the loofah soap yet but it does smell nice--it's glycerin soap so I imagine it won't be super moisturizing. The butterscotch candies are regular old butterscotch but still yummy, tea is fine. Not awesome but I'm kind of picky about tea. The biggest negative was the lotion... it came in a very cute metal tin, but the metal left rust residue in my lotion. Gross. I tried a tiny bit of it from the center where there wasn't rust--it was pretty standard lotion. Smelled nice but felt a bit filmy/residue after. I tossed the rest of the lotion due to the rust.",Neutral

Little disappointed but pretty overall.,Neutral

"Classy, different, comfortable, but will tarnish and can snap in your ear Super comfortable and easy to put in given that sterling silver is a much softer metal than titanium. Love the non-specific geometric pattern of it. Really classy and different at the same time.<br /><br />Edit: I'm afraid I must amend my review. I noticed the jewelry moved a bit and I saw it looked very black where it had been in my ear. I decided to try to take it out and see what was wrong, and it snapped in my ear just bending it slightly to angle it out of my ear. There was no injury, but picture 3 is the result of being in my ear for over a year. I am very sad because I love the look of this piercing. I must note that silver does tarnish and this naturally happens over time, I just didn't expect it to snap in my ear when taking it out. I must also note that because my piercing was fully healed, the tarnish did not discolor or infect my ear. If your piercing is still new, I would refrain from purchasing this piercing because healing skin can discolor in the presence of oxidation.",Neutral

"Dainty, but fragile I like small jewelry since I have small features. I really like the meaning behind the turquoise, so it was an easy choice for me to select this one. It's definitely accurate to describe this as dainty. I could literally curl up the entire necklace onto a penny I had sitting on my desk. The ""stones"" are very small, but they look ok when wearing this as a choker.<br /><br />I had planned on wearing this all the time with my cross, but the care directions make it clear that you should not do much of anything with it on. No sleeping, showering, or even moving around too much. I'm not sure what kind of clasp this is since I've never seen it before, but the ball slider slips even when on. I tried to show in the photo that there is nothing to prevent it from sliding over the bar and off your neck. So I'm almost afraid to wear it for fear that I may lose it.<br /><br />It's pretty, but it seems pretty fragile. And it's a necklace that you will be regularly taking off and putting back on, which is a bit difficult due to the size of the clasp.",Neutral

It's beautiful and big, exactly like the picture. Also, some reviewers complained about the bracelet being too small, but you can get a larger one for just $3 more. And that one is perfect.",Neutral

"Looks nice on the paper, no so much on the magic band. I first off want to say that when the product first arrived it seemed to be of good quality vinyl. The design was clear and not blurry and it does look just like the picture. Unfortunately, the decal does not cover the whole magic band. Instead of covering the whole side of the magic band without the holes, it has a curved end which exposes the color of your magic band. They do show this in the pictures, but I didn't realize because they show it on a purple magic band. If you have any other color magic band besides purple it makes it look ridiculous. The sticker also seemed to apply well at first, but soon got a ton of crease lines and didn't look good. I tried to use a blowdryer as per their instructions to re-activate the glue and press all the edges down. Unfortunately it still looked the same after an hour. I purchased a very similar vinyl to this on a different website and it applied perfectly and covered the entire magic band and didn't leave any part of the band exposed. I would suggest maybe skipping this one and looking elsewhere if you have anything over than a purple colored magic band.",Neutral

Very price competitive with other sanding pastes.<br /><br />Update- I've been using another brand with good effect. However, I made some small bowls from redbud tree wood and decided to try the True Grit on these since they are darker wood. It did a great job leaving a smooth surface and pleasing pop of the grain.

Colors not as vibrant as they appear here. This looks to be well made but the colors are pretty washed out compared to the images in the listing. I am keeping because it was too late to buy another gift and was quite disappointed,Neutral
Not a secure clasp but pretty bracelet I really love the bracelet but the clasp keeps loosening every time I tighten it.  It isn’t a traditional hook clasp the keep each side together,Neutral
Not bad I think the stone was black instead of blue but over all a pretty nice ring,Neutral
Three Stars Bends very easily,Neutral
Worth it but stone is way hidden down . Ring is good and heavy but stone need to b more visible n show up. And ring must b wider frm other way .... Too broad on side ways .,Neutral
Cute but very small! The stone is a lot smaller than in the picture. And mine was dark blue. Still kind of cute though.,Neutral
"Iffy I love it, but not the quality. The edges are kinda rough & peeling. Very flimsy. I thought it would come with a marker to write on with and it didn’t. Kinda bummed. Overall, way to much money for quality.",Neutral
"Diameter too small I have a very small nose. This nose ring’s diameter is too small for me, the end he cuffs the edge of my nostril, making it dent in. The thickness of the ring is nice and it’s relatively  easy to attach but it needs to be a tad wider.",Neutral

"Pretty, but super cheap clasp I’ve wanted this band for a while, but I usually don’t spend more than $20 on a band. I finally broke down and ordered it.

Rust on back of 36” black letter We really like the large letter but it was a Christmas gift I bought for my son and right out of the packaging he found areas of rust on the back.  I can’t find a way to communicate directly with the seller to see if there is someway to eliminate this problem.  Hopefully he will see this and get back to me.  I find the Amazon chatting system to be extremely limiting.,Neutral

Not easy to apply These clouds are great for the nursery. Down fall is there is no way to install them without purchasing transfer tape from your local craft store. So whatever they cost add extra cost for the transfer tape you have to purchase separately.,Neutral
"Pretty bracelet This is a pretty bracelet, with beads that seem to change color tone in the light.  Not all the beads are the color changing ones, and two of three of these were broken the first day.  Of course, they were worn by kids, but I had to remake them.",Neutral
"Just okay. Cute, but not as big as expected. Will still work to track water intake, but had problems removing stickers. Didn't seem like they were cut all the way through, so some peeled a bit. Color rubbed off a little bit on some, like the ink didn't set completely. I am going to use these, for now, but I won't reorder and I will find something else that is better quality/value. Really wanted these to be great...",Neutral
"Pretty, and then... I purchased this for my 11 yr old daughter. She was quite pleased with it. I also thought it was really pretty and seemed like quality. However the first time she wore it the charm fell off. I was able to get it back on without too much trouble but later the same day the initial charm fell off and was lost. So she and I are both disappointed with that. But even with just the aquamarine gem it’s pretty. Just thought the initial would be cute and make it personal for her. I don’t think I would order from here again. For the amount spent I would rather try somewhere else.",Neutral
Too Small The online picture had me fooled! The print quality is good but it's just too small for hanging on the wall maybe I'll find some way to use it.,Neutral

Good product but wrong spelling of my name I ordered two stockings they came out good but my name was spelt wrong.  I just contacted the seller and I am awaiting for a new stocking with the correct spelling of my name.  It is not as thick as I would have expected though.  The product is expensive and I expected it to be thicker.,Neutral
"Doesn’t fit right The size is way off, you would have to have a very wide wrist to wear each of these. Additionally the Hers bracelet was very thin so two of the His bracelets would have been a better order.",Neutral
I thought they would be a little bigger in size Size looks larger on the picture,Neutral
Nice Got for my daughter and she loved it she cook in it every day,Neutral
Decent The chain and pendant are on the small side.,Neutral

"Could look more vintage The images are printed on glossy paper, which takes away from any vintage-like quality.",Neutral
"Love but the setting scares me Thank God I have a jewelry repair kit, this is a pretty ring and I love it, but the setting prongs grab on just about everything. Luckily I noticed the prongs were opening before losing the stone. I had to self repair the ring. I won’t be wearing it as much as I like out of fear of the prongs opening and losing the stone :(",Neutral
"Too Saturated and yellow Nice idea but for this price the colors and print quality should be much better. It's very yellow tinted and saturated.<br /><br />Also arrived with damage on the corner of two of them, the paint is worn off to the canvas. Not worth $130",Neutral
It's fine Cute but very small.<br />Looks simular to the photo.<br /><br />Very dainty but perfect gague size.<br />Decent item for the price.,Neutral
Had this bracelet for about two months Really like this bracelet but now I have to fix it. Only took it off before showering.. thought it would last longer. Looks great fits well.,Neutral
"Three Stars Adorable card, and origional.",Neutral
"YOU can make it 5 stars This is a beautiful bracelet and the price is right. The only problem is that Shannon attaches the crystals facing the wrong way, with the rounded part facing the disc, so the crystal doesn't lie flat and the facets are facing inside.<br /><br />But if you let her know when you order that you want the rounded part of the crystal facing outward and away from the disc, you'll have a five-star bracelet for sure.<br /><br />I'm having my jeweler flip those stones, and then I'll have a five-star bracelet too!<br /><br />As far as another reviewer's complaint that the etching was too small, that is not correct at all. It's beautiful and big, exactly like the picture. Also, some reviewers complained about the bracelet being too small, but you can get a larger one for just $3 more. And that one is perfect.",Neutral
"Was cute for a week Bought this for my son. He never takes it off. He doesn't mind that all the silver has worn off and it's now a dingy copper/bronze. Thankfully the clasp and ""lanyard/chain"" thing is sturdy and is holding up. I know it was cheap and I got what I paid for I suppose.",Neutral
Super cute but… They’re super cute. But they’re definitely not real Swarovski. The price is a little steep for what it is. Good for a adding a pop of color to your outfit though.,Neutral

"Allergic reaction My sweet son bought me these earring for Christmas because ""mom loves the color purple"". He was so excited to see me open them on Christmas morning that I had to go put some rubbing alcohol on them and put them in my ears right away. According to my husband (he helped our son order them), the stones looked a lot smaller in the pictures. These earrings are just slightly smaller than dimes, so they're pretty big.<br />Unfortunately, day two of wearing them, I noticed one of my ears was starting to itch/burn. When I took them out, the burning ear had a perfect circle of bright red, crusty, bumpy irritation where the earring sat. The other ear was also starting to form the same irritation, but wasn't quite as bad at that point. They've been sitting in a drawer ever since. I can't bring myself to throw them away, considering who got them for me.<br /><br />After seeing all the other reviews that mention this same reaction, I wouldn't recommend. Buyer beware!",Neutral
"Slightly dangerous This is great when it is open for climbing, and I do like that it folds up. However, my 12 month old is able to push it around the room, and will push it into a wall or couch and is able to close it on his own. It then falls and is very heavy! Luckily it hasn't landed on him yet, but I wish there was a lock feature so that it would stay in the triangle position.",Neutral

Christmas smelling house! Very nice peppermint scent that lasts a long time.,Neutral

Not visually appealing It is very obvious that it is 3d printed and makes it look cheap on my setup. Would probably look better if it was at least sanded smooth.,Neutral
"So so quality. These are a ok size, but you can hardly see any of the iridescence, if that’s what you call it? Also at least 2 out of the 5 pieces had cracks throughout them.",Neutral

LETTERING ISN'T WELL LEGABLE The color of the wood is darker than photo advertised and the lettering type is hard to tell what the names say.,Neutral
"Could be better, could be worse The runes are messy, some missing or incorrect. The pieces themselves are fairly small, which I don't mind, but I'm not excited at how difficult these are to read because of how poorly they were made. Otherwise I like them.<br />I got a really nice gift with this set that makes me unlikely to return it, even though the runes are what I actually ordered, and are not very clear. The pendulum sent with it is so pretty though, and I did get it all for a very good price, defects and all. Good enough if it's cheap (I paid like $9), but if you are wanting something that is gifting quality or a bit more finished, probably keep looking. My pieces do have a good amount of flash.",Neutral

"Pretty ring just don't pay extra for the priority shipping My partner purchased this ring as a birthday present for me. He had previously purchased another item from this vendor, a pair of mermaid earrings, which I adore. He purchased this well before my birthday, and because he wanted to ensure it would be here before my birthday, it paid the + $25.00 for priority shipping. My birthday was the 9th, I received the ring on the 14th. If the quality of the ring was that of the earrings I had received, I may have been ok with the fact that it was late, but the bezel of the ring catches my hair every time I ran my fingers through it, and it has caught on my shirt and trousers when I was getting dress this morning. So its a nice ring, but the quality and price are simply not worth it.",Neutral

"I Like It…But Had Flaws I like the wooden name a lot. But, it had flaws. First, i had to sand the edges of the name because the edges weren’t smooth & pieces of wood were sticking out. (like wood tearout)<br />Second, I paid extra for it to be painted white. It was painted nicely besides the back of the dot that goes on the “i”. It was dirty & not painted. I painted it myself once i seen it wasn’t painted.<br />The name didn’t have any type of holes in the back or any type of hanging mechanism on it to be able to put it on the wall. We ended up drilling triangle ring hangers on the back to be able to hang it.<br />In the end it looks good & turned out good.

"Lower quality than expected Cute design, but I’m doubting the inks are premium as they look more subdued (less pigmented) and a bit pixelated in real life, at least the ones I received. Plus, several of my stickers on one sheet look like black ink from another print job smeared on them... very unpolished looking. See uploaded image for detail. Item also arrived later than expected and when I’d sent an inquiry to the seller, I never did receive a response. So customer service appears to be lacking as well.",Neutral

"Very Clever but Over Priced for Paper Construction Very cute and clever Christmas Tree Ornament to mark a most memorable year.  It arrives in a small gift box which makes it easy for gifting.  Please note that it's made of entirely paper, bakery string and a pasted copy printed inscription. The latter makes me think that as far as longevity in lasting for years to come, not so much.  Also, I know it's handmade but the price is steep for the materials used.  I've taken some photos and hope that they help you a bit in your decision.  It would be easier for me to recommend at a more reasonable price or if made with more longer lasting materials.  Thank you.",Neutral

I've worn them around the house, they feel wonderful but everytime I glanced at a mirror, the 925 jumped out. I even went back<br />to the site page and enlarged the earring to see if mine was an error so I could return them but even on the site page, there was the 925 on the front.<br />Who wants that?

Conversation Piece This ring is very interesting to look at and is made of sturdy material BUT you can tell by the image that it is a bit odd shaped. I have a pretty average/standard ring finger size (7) but this ring was so big that I couldn't even wear it on my thumb. I have adjusted it but if I adjust it too much more it will go from interesting looking to cheap looking and I also worry that adjusting it a lot will weaken the metal.,Neutral

Good and bad The picture on each balloons came out really nice but I filled them up with the helium tank that you would buy from Walmart and the balloons didn’t float at all. I guess they were made out of a heavy material or there’s a different helium to use? They were still a hit at my daughters 21st but I which they would of floated… I was a little bummed about that. We just put tape on the back and stuck them to the walls. But great picture quality on the balloons.,Neutral

Very cool idea good gift . if done right.. Kool idea . one was perfect one not so great. Engraved a little close to edge.

"Can't get them in I tried for about 20 min to get the ring to sit correctly with no luck. I did stretch them out quite a bit, but was worried about stretching them too much and them loosing their shape completely.

I really wanted these to work :(",Neutral
"Only used 2 days so far. I'm starting it off with 3 stars mainly because I've only been using it for 2 days and for the price I expected more. The size of the bar is about average but it would have been nice to get a mesh bag with it. Also the description says an easy rich lather which I have not got anywhere close to with my hands or a wash cloth. It does feel very nice on my skin and I suppose barely smelling it is better than being overwhelmed. That being said I've already noticed less of my natural smell than before which was my goal since ""natural"" has become stronger since I had my last child and going into menopause. I also prefer not to smell like fruit or the rose soaps I have smelled previously.",Neutral

Nice presentation I like the product but unfortunately it is bent.,Neutral
Not as great as picture They looked great at first. A few times after wearing them they lost their shine. They seem to be all plastic. In the picture it appeared as metal fastenings around the stone and that is not the case.,Neutral

Not what i expected! I purchased thinking they were nose rings and weren't more like little hope earrings.,Neutral

love the product but lost an earring =( really happy with the product but i did lose an earring after a few days. the post back is short which makes it comfortable to wear but maybe too short to keep the earring back on for long periods of time. i ordered another pair to replace it since i loved them so much hopefully will not have the same problem.,Neutral
Beautiful but not for every day I am so sad. I loved these earrings so much but they are not for every day use unfortunately. Both of the stones have fallen off at different times and I'm unable to find them so now I just have the posts. They are beautiful and perfect for all occasions BUT not for every day wear.,Neutral
But really pretty and good quality Way smaller than I thought. But really pretty and good quality,Neutral
"To each their own All of these kinds of products are subjective and dependant on the users reality. Although this product is cute and relatively sturdy, it might also not be completely natural as some people define the word. It does seem to have shavings or shards of stones and placed in a resign. I didn't expect more than that. I have only worn this necklace a handful of times. The first time I felt horrible and then realized I had covid. Then after healing it seemed to have some sort of calming affect especially for my chest. I have had heart issues in the past so this was a pleasant surprise. But the chord isnt that comfortable on my skin and the back end of the chord shifts and pulls the pendant up my chest. But thats most likely because of my weight and shape in that area. So very subjective. I try to stay open to all forms of healing and natural elements. I probably just need more on skin contact with stones. But this might work for you as either a style choice and/or healing properties if your in that state of mind/energy/reality.",Neutral
Nice size and does what it is supposed to do I’m much more confident and able to explain myself well when wearing this crystal. Reason for 3 stars was the chain broke in the first week. I just moved the crystal to another chain. But would have liked for it not to break ofcourse.,Neutral

I do love them, but can only give 3 stars for that reason.",Neutral

Disapointing It was a good novelty tee but after a few washes and yes hand washing and mechanical it faded away to relly unseeble,Neutral

"Disappointing... I REALLY wanted to love this product. I’m such a fan of a good lemongrass scent, in which you smell in the packaging.

"Probably great for someone else I really wanted to love these.  I thought they were a great idea for the very end of a period when the flow is next to nothing, or to help direct flow to the center of a pad.  And they are great for both of those things, just not great for me.  I find them irritating no matter how I fold or roll them.  Probably great for others, just not super sensitive people like me.",Neutral

"Beautiful!! I’m so happy I ordered the ‘18k Gold’ set of rings/hoops!! They’re so beautiful & dainty. I’ve been on the hunt for a very snug nose ring so the variety of sizes in the set was perfect. I currently have 1 in my nose piercing & 2 in my lobes. They were super easy to bend & adjust, they are very delicate so just be careful not to bend too aggressively. These have a high-end & sleek look without breaking the bank, I highly recommend these!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/9/23: full transparency- I’m taking off 2 stars with this updated review. These have held up fairly well. The hoops in my ears are still perfect. My main complaint is that the gold has rubbed off the hoop that I have in my nose piercing. I guess that’s to be expected with something that is only gold filled wire, although it says ‘the gold layer is thick’. It’s clearly fairly thin because I’ve had other gold filled nose rings that have lasted a years without rubbing off. I’m disappointed since the hoop in my nose is the perfect ‘snug’ size & I have had trouble finding one until now.",Neutral

"Pretty bracelet, one annoyance I got this for my wife and she loved it. Loved the engraving and the soft leather.<br />After wearing about a week though, she now has staining on her wrist where the clasp is.

"High expectations, high disappointment The paper, while a decent weight and seemed decent....the ""gold"" shown in the picture is nothing like that in reality.  It is more of a flat cream color with beige highlights, not at all looking like the photo where it looks metallic gold.  Also, while packaged tightly there was a  tear in one sheet. Not sure if that will be visible upon mounting, but for the price and shipping costs it's highly disappointing.<br />**After contact with vendor, I have amended to 3 stars because while there was some back and forth, ultimately they worked with me to resolve situation satisfactorily.",Neutral
"Not great for the price Everything looks just as expected and described. I was disappointed because despite the efforts to mail them in a rigid envelope, there are multiple dents in the vinyl that definitely show in the frames. For how expensive these were I would hope for perfection. We were in a time crunch so we used them anyway.",Neutral
"Nice, Not Highly Reflective or Glittery These earrings are a nice size. I like that the studs are 925 sterling silver. The screw back ball shape isn't my ideal type of earring backing and is a personal choice that didn't impact my review. The main reason I gave these earrings a 3 is their lack luster. They just don't have the quality glittery effect I'm accustomed to finding in CZ stones. It's disappointing since the earrings I ordered were 6mm and present a nice size for faux diamond earrings.",Neutral

I know that the description never claimed that the symbol was real metal, but for $24.95 I just assumed based on the picture that it was. It will still make a good anniversary gift, though!",Neutral

All the fun and impact of the ornament is lost since it's hardly recognizable on a tree unless you are a foot or two away and closely inspecting the ornament. The photos on Amazon are clearly closeups and not a great representation of how this will (not) stand out on your tree. It's even too shall to decorate a package or be placed in the house somewhere as a decoration. I had planned on giving this as a gift to a huge Bill Murray fan, but it's size is problematic and embarrassing, especially considering the cost.",Neutral

If they sent S-hooks or something more durable to pair with the tag, I’d probably bump up to 5 stars, but I think it’s the combination of the chain link closure and the thin keychain-type ring to attach to the dog collar that led to the loss of it within a week.

"Color is wrong The quality of the shirt and the printing of graphics are top-notch. The only thing keeping this from being rated 5-stars is the color of the shirt was wrong.

"Not the quality I expected I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46.

"A size larger than what I bought If I wanted 8 mm, I would give this 5 stars. It is lovely. I just put it in & unfortunately, it's larger than the 7mm I ordered by an extra mm. I have many hoops, ranging from 6mm to 9mm. My favorite diameter is 7mm because it fits snug but not too tight like the 6mm hoops. The 9mm hoops are BIG & I only wear them to make a bolder statement. I am still comfortable wearing the 8mm because it isn't too big but just a little bold enough. I really needed a 7mm, tho. I have read the other reviews about skin irritation. Even tho none of us are actually meant to wear sterling silver 24/7 because it tarnishes & thus, causes irritation, I did see a review where they weren't allergic to silver but sensitive to cheaper metals & the metal caused a mild infection & bump on their piercing within several hours. I do not know if this was a new piecing or not as that wasn't specified by the reviewer. If your piercing is new & has not completely healed, never put in new jewelry, including sterling silver jewelry. Sterling silver will irritate new piercings that aren't fully healed, even if you *think* your new piercing is fully healed, it's best to wait at least 4 to 6 months. But again, I don't know if that was their actual issue so leave it to me to be the guinea pig. I will leave this piercing in for several hours & if it gets irritated, then you'll know this is not genuine sterling silver but cheap metal that isn't hypoallergenic. Wish me luck! (My piercing is old & completely heald throughout, btw)<br />I will update tomorrow.<br />*UPDATE*<br />It is tomorrow. I confess, I ended up taking it out only a couple hours after I left the review. Now, I don't know if I let some of these reviews get in my head but my nose piercing started to feel..... funny. Like a very slight tingling sensation. I have never had my piercing feel like that before & I admit, after seeing so many people warn that they ended up with bumps & infections & all around discomfort, I noped on out & took the ring out. I absolutely am not taking the chance of messing up my piercing. That said, and again, it could be fear & psychological, but after I took the hoop out, my nose piercing didn't tingle anymore.",Neutral

Further, there are scratches on the image itself.<br /><br />I love to support a custom print for the prices artists charge. But I feel some kind of way when it's so carelessly cut.

Beautiful necklace The necklace is beautiful but after a few weeks the chain on it is starting. I got the original necklace that came with it so not sure want to expect but the chain rusting? Sad I really love the,Neutral
"Petite and Pretty, but ... I really liked the look of this little necklace in the Amazon photo, and I do think it's pretty, but here's what I don't like about it  First, it's really choker length as one other viewer said and the chain is not that sturdy.  On a child's neck it would hang prettily but on me, it's a choker and not all that comfortable to wear as I'm continually pulling on it.  Next, and this is my worst complaint, the Swarofski teardrop is way too small.  It's barely visible when on the neck so wearing it is pointless.  Last, it's very difficult to put on.  The clasp is so small and dainty that it took me a long time to get it connected.  So, I will probably keep this necklace and give it to a child as a special gift, but for me it's not suitable.  If these would be issues for you, look for something bigger or ask the artist to make it longer and put on a bigger crystal so it can be seen and worn appropriately.  Just to be clear, my issues are not with the artist or workmanship; they concern the design aspects of the piece.  Just my opinion.",Neutral

I love the raw stones and variance that comes with it.

Before our next cruise, I’ll buy some additional magnets and glue to the back of both so they stick really well!",Neutral

"Zero Blue Sheen in my stone Highly disappointed in the stone I received as it has absolutely zero adularescence - it is completely missing the trade ""blue sheen"" that makes moonstone desirable - the entire reason I was looking for a piece like the pictures show.

Overwhelming fragrance I just got this today for a beach vacation since we are doing carry on only.  I'm unsure whether I can actually use it as the scent out of the package is horribly overwhelming.

"Simple, lightweight As far as gold hoops go, they do the job. They are extremely lightweight so if you want to dabble into the possibilty of wearing hoops but arent sure, give them a try.<br />I definitely think these would make good earrings for little girls because they dont pull, arent distracting, and they are smaller so they wouldnt look out of place on smaller features.<br />I give them 3 stars because I had a hard time clasping them in place, since its an insert rather than a clasp.<br />So far ive worn them twice and had no skin sensativities as well.

Arrived broken Bought this for my little girl’s nursery and it arrived broken. One spot had a small split and another was actually splintered wood.  Contacted the seller and they said to put wood glue on it and would get a partial refund (which I don’t think I ever got).  I used wood glue and painted it but it definitely still shows.

"I wanted to love it.... but.... I was so excited to receive this coffee table.... I was expecting the wood to be rustic with possible knots and imperfections as stated in the description. However, I was not prepared to see a very large, completely open knot hole on the top of the table, where I can see clear through to my carpet. Such a bummer. I will now either return the item, or attempt to fill the knot hole, but neither solution is ideal. The table is pretty, but the wood feels extremely light weight, not very durable and there is no poly to protect it. If I end up keeping it, that is yet another step I will have to take for the table to last any length of time. The company has beautiful pieces, and I wanted to buy more from them, but sadly this was not a great first impression :(<br />**UPDATE** We ended up keeping the table and adding a few coats of polyurethane. The color is now darker but at least we can use it without staining it. As it settled in our home, a the ends of two boards have slightly popped up causing an uneven surface. You can tell they tried to fix this problem as there is a hammer dent on one of the boards. All in all, I’m adding a star for the uniqueness of the table, but wish there weren’t quality issues :(",Neutral

It carries a premium price which I was okay with since I was getting a nice ""lacquered tray"", or so I thought.

"Awesome art.  So-so poster quality. This artist’s minimalistic style is very, very cool.  His shipping was extremely fast, too.  However, when I took the poster to a local custom framer last year, they advised me that the image transfer onto the poster material was uneven.  They had to cut into the border at an odd angle in order to get the poster to center correctly inside the frame.  It’s in a frame now, and it’s never coming out, so I guess in hindsight it’s not that big a deal.  It looks beautiful framed up, I’ll say that.  Having said that, though, it sure would be nice if this artist put as much time and effort into the print job as he does actually creating the artwork itself.",Neutral

"Nice stones, Short stud These earrings are really cute, the diameter of the stone is perfect for my second lobe piercing. The only issue I've run into is that the stud length is quite a bit shorter than a typical earring. When I wear them my ears feel like I have a typical stud tightened as much as I can, and that's just on the first click.<br /><br />Update: I've worn these earrings several times, and they just don't work for my ears.

Beautiful but very fragile The tags are beautifully scripted. The problem is they are made of such a soft wood that they break very easily. The vendor was very nice and replaced the one that came broken. However I used them for the first time last night and two snapped in half. I was extremely careful in handling them but the wood is just to light and fragile. I would suggest to make them a bit heavier even if the cost was slightly higher.,Neutral

"Nice set but the scent is a little weird To start out, I got this kit as a way to have a little break and relax as I wasn't able to celebrate with family over the holidays. While this was relaxing overall, there were several issues that I would think about before purchasing.Here are my thoughts:<br />Presentation: This comes in a much smaller box than I thought. While all of the items I would say were full or travel sized everything was fit very tightly together/you couldn't immediately see everything in the box before you unpacked it. There was a bit of packing stuff but it didn't do much to lessen the overcrowded box effect.<br /><br />Candle: This candle is 4 oz and will likely have about a 15-20 hour burn time. It had a nice clean burn and the wax melted evenly around the candle. It has a very light scent and I had to be very close to the candle to smell it.<br /><br />Bath salt: comes in a vial with crushed rose petals and large salt crystals and will probably last one to two baths. I have dry skin and found this overall to be very soothing. The only issue was that while most of the salt dissolved easily within 1-2 minutes there was a bit of a sand at the bottom of my bathtub after everything dissolved. It had a nice clean vaguely rose scented smell. I would have appreciated a little more fragrance but appreciate that it wasn't overdone to the point I would come out smelling like a funeral home. The crushed rose bits also made for extra hassle during clean up.<br /><br />Eye Mask:I was impressed with this, the satin was softer than others I have received in kits and wasn't overly tight as to press too firmly on my eyes.<br /><br />Body Butter: This is perhaps the item I am most confused by. It is a very thick, rich formula but when I went to apply it, it stung a bit. I have very dry skin during the cold months so this has happen before with lotions but is generally not a problem with body butter. It was a mild irritation that seemed to go away after a few minutes but was still offputting so I only used it on my legs. It also has a pretty funky smell coming out of the container that is hard to place. After a few minutes, as it soaked into my skin it evened out and smelled like a bit more like sandalwood.<br /><br />Bath bomb: It's vanilla coconut scented while the rest of the kit is some variation on rose. As a result, I have not used it yet.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay gift set and did have some positives but the scents and formulations would keep me from fully recommending it in the future.",Neutral

"Read carefully before purchasing I guess I wasn’t reading carefully enough before I clicked “purchase”. This is just a printed piece of paper. The pictures are a bit misleading, so don’t use them as a guide for what you’re getting. I was hoping this would at least be heavy cardstock, but it really isn’t. It’s not even as heavy as a poster, so you will likely be as underwhelmed as I was… if you don’t read closely too. Thankfully I checked it out before giving it as a gift. I’ll purchase a frame first, and then gift it. The frame will likely be cheaper than the print, so the value for the money isn’t there.",Neutral
"Sickeningly Sweet, Sticky Slime Slime smelled like an overly sweet pastry candle. So strong that I cannot open the container without feeling nauseated from how overpowering it is. Did not smell like pumkin spice much, at all. The slime was very sticky even after being mixed. No activator was sent along with it, so I'm not sure if it's due to lack of experience on the seller's part or not. I've ordered many slimes and they've all come with activator and care instructions (even if all I ordered was a sample size). The packaging was cute and the texture of the slime wasn't bad, outside of the stickiness. If you don't like sweet, sugar cookie smelling candles, I recommend trying a different scented one. Did not look as pictured, either. I wouldn't buy it again, but others may really like it. When it comes to slime, it's all about preference.",Neutral

Animal pictures They are cute but the main picture posted is kind of deceptive.  The only reason I picked these is because I thought there was a pink border around the picture and there isn’t.

However, within an hour of placing my order, two tops, I contacted the seller to make a change and they refused to accommodate.

This makes me think twice about ordering from this seller again or recommending them despite the cute necklace.",Neutral
"Mine fell apart The product is a graphic, sandwiched between two pieces of plastic. The plastic pieces seem to just pop together. Mine popped apart as I took it out of the box for inspection.<br /><br />Otherwise it is a nice presentation, great message, unique and giftable. I popped it back together and gave it!",Neutral
"Not as pictured First of all, I haven't received the legs of the bench yet.  (I just now received the top, so I'm giving them some time, figuring they might be shipping separately.--But why?  Why would you ship them separately? That's so weird.)  So, this review is just for the top.<br /><br />And the top is... not what I expected.  The wood looks nothing like the picture (which I now think likely has some sort of photo filter applied to it).  It looks like cheap pine you can get from Home Depot.  The pieces seem solidly joined--so that's good.  But the finish is bad.  I can and have done a much better job finishing furniture than this.  I expect professional woodworkers to be a little more skilled than I am and to put forth a better product.  It's stained with a red-ish stain, but it doesn't even have a clear coat on it.  It certainly doesn't have a ""walnut"" finish, as the description claims.<br /><br />I'm gonna have to sand the whole thing down, restain and then seal it.<br /><br />And the cut of the wood lacks the rustic quality shown in the photos.  Like I said, it just looks like lumber from Home Depot.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much it would cost to just buy legs like these separately, but if it's less than $75 or so, I'd say I way overpaid for this.  And I got it on a significant sale.  If I had paid full price, I probably would try to return it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solid joinery<br />Nice, thick slab<br />Size is as ordered<br />The shipping on the top came significantly early<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bad finish<br />Legs missing or shipped separately<br />Not rustic--cheap-looking lumber<br />Off-gassing from finish<br />Just overall unimpressive",Neutral

Not my favorite This specific scent is not my personal favorite. It doesn’t smell bad but if I smelled it first I wouldn’t have bought it. It does not moisturize my hair at all. It actually dries it out significantly. If you have naturally oily hair causing build up in your locs this will likely work for you. Also if you accidentally over-moisturized your locs this is good to counter that.,Neutral
It's OK I thought it would be nicer.,Neutral

"Cute Fun Item Cute fun faux nose piercing. Looks realistic, for the price it’s fine. Happy with the product and give that a thumbs up. What I didn’t like is the way they shipped it!

I’m environmentally aware and friendly, this upset me to see such waste.",Neutral

"Very cute but very cheap The hanger is super cute and was delivered quickly and packaging was great. However, the hanger is really flimsy. The wire can easily bend. It is not thick and sturdy.

"Sub par workmanship I was so excited when I ordered my noodle board. The seller was responsive and designed my board with a rooster design.  When the board arrived I found that the workmanship was less than good. The handles are loose and cannot be tightened. They are loose enough that I am afraid to use them to pick the board up. It is also obvious that the seller put the handles on incorrectly and replaced them, leaving holes that he fixed with putty. That would be okay if it wasn’t so obvious. The attached pictures show the repaired holes and how they look on the board. There are also holes on the back of the board that were made when the seller put the handles in the wrong spot. They were left unfilled and it looks unfinished and cheap. The board itself is made with three pieces of wood that do not lay flat making It difficult to put anything on it. I contacted the seller to see if there this could be remedied but I got no response. I recommend you use another vendor if you want a noodle board. The quality and service are lacking here.",Neutral

Not like the picture Sadly we got our order and our daughter's name was miss spelled. Also there is no real sparkle or sequence. Very disappointing.

Poster comes folded Reminded me of getting a poster in teen magazine,Neutral
Disappointing and not as good as I expected. I was really expecting a whole lot! It was beautiful in other people’s pictures and thought it would look great for me. I chose the gray stain and it did not look as gray and beautiful as the one pictured on review. And the flower was bent in the box. Also the hinges weren’t on well. It would not keep the lid open and would flop down. To top it off I originally got someone else’s order with 2 weeks to spare from my wedding day! So I was highly disappointed when I finally received my order and it was a subpar ring box. The box itself was very thin and feels like it would break if you dropped it.,Neutral

A little disappointed The pics were fine altho' I was surprised that they were just glossy printouts.  One of the pics was double-triple print offset and blurry.,Neutral
Took longer than expected. It took a long time to receive.  It also came doused in a very strong scent. I was not able to keep it in my house as the scent was too strong. Had to return it and paid for postage.,Neutral
"Very small I agree with the others who have reviewed, it is very small but very cute.  The description gives the size but its kind of like when my husband stretches his caught fish to measure it.  ;)  Maybe the seller could take pictures with a ruler or her hand next to the items.  Also, on the 6-inch snowman, there was a sticker that was 4x1 inch explaining the coffee dye appearance but when the sticker came off it took the dye with it, leaving a 4x1 white patch.",Neutral
Not great This product does not clean and barely frizz. I was very disappointed. The ad should state that it is a deodorizer because it does have a nice smell but a cleaner it’s not. A waste of money and time.,Neutral
"Used to be great quality, now they're like paperclips. Bought a pair about two years ago and LOVE them. Tough, durable, beautiful. Bought another pair about a year ago and the quality has gone significantly down. Bought one more pair a month ago to see how they've changed and they're still cheap. Flimsy, will break very quickly since these types of earrings require you to mold them to your ear a little. The first pair is stiff and strong. The last two pairs are thinner and cheaper than most paperclips.",Neutral

"Pretty bracelet, one annoyance I got this for my wife and she loved it. Loved the engraving and the soft leather.<br />After wearing about a week though, she now has staining on her wrist where the clasp is.

As expected Although I think it was a little overpriced it's nice. It's a nice gift for someone,Neutral
Tarnished and cheap looking Half of the flower clip was badly tarnished and does not look like it appears on image. The clip is way bigger than it appears because the image shows the clip tucked in.

Luckily I have been able to repair it but for the price, this shouldn't happen, also was expecting the color that is pictured. I have to say though that I had to contact the seller about a shipping question and they were excellent at communication in that respect.",Neutral

Whoever placed the decal on must of lifted the decal off again before pressing it down creating the ripples / scratch etc. If you look at the photo you will see 2 areas above the M & below the A.

Very small.Love the design! I love the design! I have mixed review on this at the moment. I initially bought this for my nose piercing which is so funny because it doesn’t even go in my nose. It’s so small in length and thin when you try to put it on. you need to be careful with it. The good thing it says it can be used for other ear piercings which I am getting in the future. I’m not sure it will fit but will just have to see.,Neutral

Not bad.. Not amazing.. Pretty basic I'm disappointed with the overall quality of the final outcome. The little circle is off centered and does not cover the whole side that it is meant to cover. It is a basic measuring tape that they got from home depot or lowes and they glued a thin wooden circle to the side of it. The engraving looks fine. No issues there but I'm still wishing that they picked a better size circle of wood or at least centered it better. This is meant to be a gift... and it is barely giftable with the poor attention to detail here. And there's some type of dried glue that didn't get clean up and now it's dried on there unable to take off... was excited for the concept. And I might be nit picking.... but I expected better quality. I guess the measuring tape itself works fine. 3 out of 5. marked down one star for placement of wood and another for the wood glue.,Neutral

Most Beautiful Band I Own I absolutely LOVE the look of this watch band and have zero complaints about its beauty or appearance. However I can only give it 3 Stars since it fails to fully function as an Apple Watch band should. This band cannot keep a tight fit against your wrist and as a result your health data isn’t computed properly because your watch is not understood to be “on your wrist”. I REALLY wanted this to be functional for everyday use but unfortunately it will only be used for special occasions. i am DEFINITELY keeping it because it’s so gorgeous and I LOVE IT!!! Just wished it could be improved to clasp tighter on first wrap.,Neutral

The vinyl letters don't appear to have had a sealant sprayed over them and the plaque is very thin.  This is NOT a sign meant for an exposed area...definitely needs to be on a covered porch with protection from moisture.<br /><br />Those who are crafty could simply buy a black plaque from the craft store with 40-50% off coupon, press-on letters from the dollar store, and make it for far less.",Neutral

The quality is excellent, but I can't rate higher because it's not an efficient way to get bases.<br />I was trying to order multiple bases, which the picture had me believing and the title said ""bases"" indicating plural.

Preview would have helped I wish I could have had a preview of the initials. I got TLZ for my son. The Z looks more like a 2 than a z. I'm dissappointed in the appearance. The concept is really neat. He loves to fish. It's a christmas present so we'll see what he thinks.,Neutral

"Cute but spins around I get a lot of compliments on it but it is a little bulky and heavy (even tho it’s made of felt). The alligator clip has a tendency to spin so the little book is often off kilter, sideways or upside down while wearing it. I do like it and think it’s cute, though.",Neutral
"Do Not Expect Perfection for Public Display I bought solid wood framed map in large siz to display in medical clinic patient waiting room. The frame was apparently handled while stain or finish was still tacky because it is covered with prints in the finish. In addition, the foam board id thin so that the push pins go all the way through. If you should purchase this, be awarre that it will possibly NOT be the quality workmanship, and that the manufacturer argues that the item is perfection and does not stand behind the product. We would have, at the very least, expected an offer of a sheet of foam board to spray glue tto back and stain to touch up the many fingerprints or rubber  glove prints, as the seller claims. All we received was an argument defending the seller’s educational credentials.<br /><br />Follow up.  Debbie after several phone calls, replaced the defective frame.

Mine was just poorly made, although I'm sure that isnt the case with them all I can see them being very popular. It would be cool to be able to choose your stones because I wouldn't mind mine and my husbands stone instead of my birthstone and a cz. Maybe secure the pins that hold the ring on better. Mine could have just fallen out but I didnt wear it after I noticed that within the first hour of having it. Great ring though.",Neutral

"Nice Photo paper prints were well packaged and arrived in great condition. The photo is in the center of an 8x10 printer photo sheet. The photo is actually really pretty. But for me I felt that the colors were not as vibrant or standout as in the amazon pic. I laminated them and that really made the colors darker and stand out more. Not too happy with the price after all, but not entirely disappointed. I am using them in my office and after laminating and framing I am sure they will garner positive attention from all who come in.",Neutral
Okay but not the best quality. I bought because it was cheaper than the Comfortroll D-Lux tray but there are quality differences. I mistakenly didn't check my tray to the cutout template before cutting. I discovered my tray wasn't square so a couple of screws don't hit. This could have been resolved if the tray cap has the screws set further out on the flange.  One big item is that the trolling motor cable cutout is too far to the left. I had to cut out additional clearance to keep my Fortrex pedal centered. If I didn't clearance the slot then the pedal would have been jammed against the left side of the tray. Other little things are the sloppy waterjet start stops and the fact that every tool slot had to be filed to fit my standard pliers and scissors.  Not the best if you don't like to modify things.,Neutral

"Pretty but...going back Very pretty necklace but I returned it.  It is very delicate, which I like but that also seems to make the quality of the chain not very good at all.  It kinks easily and my biggest pet peeve is that hook part of the chain is constantly slipping around to the front of the necklace.  It is almost like the hook is heavier than the heart which weights it to slip to the front.  For the two days I wore it I was constantly adjusting it.  Also, like others said, the heart is very, very tiny (it is super cute) and flips around on chain a lot.  It is so small that it is hard to tell what it is when you are wearing it.  Oh well.  I will keep looking for something similar but a bit more substantial.",Neutral

"Finish and routing is rough This piece looks GREAT once hung on the wall, but the final finish on the piece is rough and needs to be sanded since the finish that's on it raised the grain.  The routing around the letters is also rough like a dull bit was used to create the piece.  If you look at the picture, there is quite a bit of ""chatter"" around the edges.<br /><br />Since this will be hung at 10 feet off the floor, it's not going to be an issue for me, but if it were at eye level, I'd have to sand it a bit to clean it up and then refinish the top coat.<br /><br />Am I happy with it, yes, will I order from them again, probably so, but I expected a better final finish than I received for the amount I paid.",Neutral

"Meh It’s a nice concept. But the spiral is uncomfortable to actually insert without major distortion to the ring. I imagine that a few jewelry changes and the metal will break from repeatedly pulling and pinching the spring back together. The end(s) also rub your nostril and can make a raw spot. Most annoyingly though, the end that rests inside your nostril will unfortunately collect mucus over the day and that’s not something you want to advertise to the public. Overall, it is hard to keep clean and not worth the irritation. I was pretty bummed because I really liked the intended look. Maybe someone with a different nostril shape would have a better experience.",Neutral

They're cute, but they're so small, they are a hassle to get on and off.  And you have to do a lot of bending of the metal hook - not sure what it's called, but the part that goes through your ear - to get them on and off.  Eventually that metal is going to break.  Thus, they're overpriced.  And I have 4mm birthstone earrings, and I really don't think the turquoise is 4mm.  More like 2.5 or 3.",Neutral

"Light sensor in wrong spot. This is a beautiful piece. However, the light sensor, which determines whether or not it illuminates is on the bottom. This makes the light stay on in many situations where it is not needed as there is ample light. This is especially true when using a counter outlet or one close to the floor. Moving th sensor to the top would alleviate the problem, so all that’s necessary is to assemble it facing the other direction.",Neutral

It has a bright, shiny finish and is ever so thin, just like I wanted. But it fits about a full size smaller than what I ordered so I can’t even wear it. It’s just sitting in my jewelry box at this point, which is unfortunate since it is a nice ring. Definitely order a size up from your usual ring size with this one.",Neutral

Seem cheaply made. I was hoping these would be solid a thicker than they are. The earrings are VERY thin and light weight and I am VERY concerned these will bend.

"Didn't work for my longboard, but company offered fab service to adjust it These brakes have a design problem for my flexible long board: there's a low spot of the friction material 8-9"" in front of the truck. Company says they can get that clearance to more than an inch with other parts. I don't want to try though, with my bamboo deck. Turns out that's a problem on sidewalks and streets. If brake material drags unexpectedly, on surface irregularities, I'd fly off.

"Nice, but don't sleep with them on They're nice and genuine, but the backings fell out. I thought the seller was going to send out an extra set for the 2nd purchase, but only received 1 set. Good craftsmanship on the casings themselves though (I reload so I would know).",Neutral
"Does the job. It does the job. It’s cute. It’s affordable however..what I did not like from it was the way it was printed. When you peel the sticker off, it cuts off the majority of the flowers. If you know it’s going to cut out the flowers, why not shrink the label into fitting into the size of the sticker? It just looks like a lazy print job to be honest. But again, you get what you pay for.",Neutral
"3-D Printed The tray looks as indicated. My only complaint is that it was 3-D printed. It looks pretty cheesy, I probably should have printed this myself.",Neutral
Nice Nice but think it may be hard to stamp on an egg.  I couldn’t figure it out.,Neutral
"Small Love the earrings, but they were much smaller than I was hoping for.",Neutral
Big The workmanship is great but too big for the yeti.,Neutral
"Leaked out Product seems great, but was leaking when I opened the package.",Neutral
"Cute but overpriced I thought this would be a heavier, nicer material. It’s cute but it’s overpriced for what it is.",Neutral
Puerto Rico Cupcake toppers Cheaply made. Some of the pieces were not properly glued together. My kindergarten students could make these better!!!,Neutral
Three Stars Product was very difficult to transfer to the wall.  We were unsuccessful and gave up on it.,Neutral
"... to the plastic coated material that it is (although easy to clean) The cloth itself is quite lovely -- though I would have preferred cloth material to the plastic coated material that it is (although easy to clean). I give it 3 stars because it has no zipper or snaps to take the cloth off the umbrella table. As it is, one would have to take the umbrella out of the table each time you put the cloth on the table and each time you take it off.  I cut the cloth and will have the tailor put either snaps or a zipper on it. I bought two of these cloths in different colors -- really like them both, except for this nuisance. American-made cloths usually come with an &#34;escape route&#34; for those made for umbrella tables.<br /><br />Ruth Dunner",Neutral
Small Small,Neutral
Take the good with the bad. The item really helped my scalp itch but it leaves a residue. The spray bottle doesn’t work either it’s too big for the bottle and gets stuck. If it didn’t leave the residue on my scalp I would love this product. But I will have to continue looking for something that helps my scalp itch without the white residue.,Neutral
Clarity much??? I liked the design but I didn’t have a notebook and had a hard time trying to figure out where to get one. Pretty disappointed.,Neutral
I was expecting better Ordered a painted blue one and they only painted one side and the other side was just smeared paint,Neutral
"U.S. Camper Map Thought it had Canada on it, too, as United States alone was less money.  The order form was a bit misleading to me.  The size, however, is good for a small, vintage camper.",Neutral
Not as vibrant as photo Less vibrant than expected and one of the stones cracked apart where it threads onto the bracelet. But it is authentic,Neutral
Not bad.. Not amazing.. Pretty basic I'm disappointed with the overall quality of the final outcome. The little circle is off centered and does not cover the whole side that it is meant to cover. It is a basic measuring tape that they got from home depot or lowes and they glued a thin wooden circle to the side of it. The engraving looks fine. No issues there but I'm still wishing that they picked a better size circle of wood or at least centered it better. This is meant to be a gift... and it is barely giftable with the poor attention to detail here. And there's some type of dried glue that didn't get clean up and now it's dried on there unable to take off... was excited for the concept. And I might be nit picking.... but I expected better quality. I guess the measuring tape itself works fine. 3 out of 5. marked down one star for placement of wood and another for the wood glue.,Neutral
It was ok Love the design. Unfortunately it was too short. Bought a 2xl. Width was great but length wasn’t equivalent.<br />Still good product.,Neutral
Very cool idea good gift . if done right.. Kool idea . one was perfect one not so great. Engraved a little close to edge. If not for this engraved misalignment I would give 5 stars . but for this alone I give them 3 stars .. Wifes looks great just mine the heart is right on the edge. Little disapointed as time passes I think its going to look well crappy..,Neutral
"i like it but disappointing I like the weight and size of the necklace but I have two problems with it:<br />1.  The colors are not as vibrant as in the image.  My guess is light would have to hit it for colors to show vibrantly, but who's going to sit in bright light/sun just to show off their necklace?  The colors are dull.<br />2.  The adjustable necklace is awkward.  You can adust it but it leaves a 'pony tail' at the end of the necklace that can only be covered if you are wearing a t-shirt.  Does not look attractive.  Easy fix is to replace the cord (yes, it's just a cord).",Neutral
"Not so great.... It does not work for my son. It is a great quality, but not safe. I am afraid using it as I always think my son will remove his hands and fall down.",Neutral
"Read the description carefully The ad does say they are very small in a few places. Anyone complaining about size did not read what they were buying.<br /><br />I have mined Herkimer diamonds, found only in Herkimer, NY. What distinguishes them from regular quartz crystals is that each have 10 facets and double terminations.  The smaller they are, the more likely they are to be crystal clear. The larger ones are more imperfect and sometimes contain sediment.  We were fortunate enough to find 4 golf ball sized “diamonds”, but they were not as pretty as the tiny flawless specimens we have. Odd that these are made and/or sold out of Texas.",Neutral
Size really matters Disappointed in size.,Neutral
Cute but… Came bent,Neutral
Chain not good Great looking chain broke after second time I wore it.,Neutral
"Pretty but pricey I neither dislike nor hate the images, they're pretty, and the company whom provides the images are super helpful if you have no way of printing out your own images. I just wish I could order just the one image instead of all.",Neutral
Cute but not gift material.. Packaging was a little disappointing being A garnet and gold necklace. I planned to gift to my friend for her birthday but I’ll have to find a way to package it so it doesn’t look as cheap:/,Neutral
"Not sure about the cat nip My cat didn’t go into a frenzy like normal, so I was a little disappointed. The material and shape were fun, but it seemed like a waste of money.",Neutral
"cute and creative Bigger than expected, but still very cute and creative",Neutral
Not quite what I expected They only really show their beauty in very bright light. I think they look better in the picture.,Neutral
"Disappointed This tarnished pretty quickly after wearing it. I don't ever take it out, because it's so beautiful I just wish it kept its silverness",Neutral
"Great but runs way too big Cute, but my size small is HUGE! It looks sloppy because of how large it is.",Neutral
Three Stars A little shorter than I would have liked.,Neutral
"Awkward fit This is a medium V-neck, I’m 5’1 and 140lbs, fits a lot snugger than I expected and the material isn’t as moveable as it appears in the picture. It’s big up top in the shoulder area but right in the stomach.  The picture also shows the shirt tied and you’d have to size up if you want that fit.",Neutral
"Beautiful quote, but the size was much smaller than I expected for the price I love the positive affirmation quote. However, I expected a poster size, not an 8 x 10. That's my fault for not reading the size. However for the cost, I thought it would be much bigger, as it appeared to be poster-like. I'll be more thorough in my reading next time.",Neutral
Beautiful but... More suited to a child than a 16 year old. Unless you want to give an expensive souvenir. The return cost me $15. Waiting for my refund which at least they approved. Lesson learned.<br />Update: my refund was issued immediately upon return and customer service was efficient and prompt.,Neutral
"Are they pearls? I am no pearl expert or even amature but these just don't look like pearls. They are are button shaped and flat on the back.<br />They are very cute and they are stamped 925, sterling. They are lightweight and very comfortable. These would make a nice gift for a young girl or someone who just likes minimalist jewelry.",Neutral
Three Stars okay but not really what i expected,Neutral
Pretty colors for birthdates Like it good condition,Neutral
Three Stars It would have been nicer if they were bigger,Neutral
"Great leather, BUT… Only took few days for button to break meanwhile I took it out of my pocket maybe 4-5 times.. but it has great leather and feels amazing.",Neutral
Three Stars Wish it was easy to find 22 inch length necklaces- 16-18 inch are not comfortable for me,Neutral
"Nice digital print of image. NOT real paper, same dictionary page background for every image. I've always loved this image and was looking for awesome art to lead my staircase.<br /><br />I ordered four different prints; however, all images are imposed upon the exact same page from the dictionary, on photo paper.<br /><br />I've seen these before done on actual dictionary pages, but I didn't know these were just digital prints, not paper.<br /><br />I'm hoping people don't look too closely at them.<br /><br />Variety would give this 5 stars. I was just very disappointed that they were all printed on the same background and was computer paper.",Neutral
Cute but smallest than expected Really cute. Just thinner and smaller overall than I was expecting.,Neutral
"Cute, dainty, difficult closure The chain is good quality, but my only complaint is the closure. Instead of a traditional lobster claw closure, this necklace has a spring ring, and very small connector rings. Long story short, I have to put the necklace on backwards in the mirror, and then turn it around.",Neutral
"Not worth it. It looks like it should be on a metal board, not just a printed picture. I get needing to make money, and I'm okay with that, but 12.95 is ridiculous.",Neutral
Loved it. I do an ornament each year for ... Loved it.  I do an ornament each year for my kids.  They moved to Virginia this year!,Neutral
It's a little tricky at first but I figured out how to assemble. It's a little tricky at first but I figured out how to assemble.  One of them blinked on while the sun was out and then it didn't work at all during the evening. I don't know how to replace that one.,Neutral
Not very good. The paper is flimsy and they look like they were Xeroxed on a cheap copier.,Neutral
It is super pretty like in the picture but too big for my toe I like it i wont be returning it but not able to wear it on my toe because its too loose. Pops off when i take a step. It doesnt have an adjustable size thing which is fine by me i just really like the design,Neutral
"Looks great, but it’s a poster and not cardboard We loved this customized photo frame for a photo booth for our wedding day. The only unexpected thing was this was poster paper, like the kind of paper you might see a movie or band photo on, tacked on a teenager’s wall. We had to buy a poster board from a box store and find a way to adhere it and cut out the center in order for this to work as a photo frame. If we had known this, we might have purchased something different for ease of assembly.",Neutral
Small but nice Arrived quickly<br />Very cute<br />Sadly kind of small<br />Nice gift,Neutral
They are nice but are much smaller than we expected We bought these as a gift. They are nice but are much smaller than we expected.,Neutral
"Cheap chain Glass is nice, chain is cheap",Neutral
"Really pretty but REALLY tiny The reviews had mentioned these are small earrings, but that's an understatement.  Putting them on, if you're an adult, is quite a challenge.  And, depending on where the piercing is on your ear, they don't dangle or move at all.  That said, the stones are quite lovely and the very first time I wore them, I got a compliment.  Plus, in these days of mask wearing, they don't interfere or get caught up in the mask.  So, if you have petite ears or are willing to be patient when trying to put them on, they really are very pretty.",Neutral
"Not What I Expected Its honestly a nice wall decor, the craftsmanship is superb BUT this is not what I ordered. The border pictured is distressed and that is not what I received. I had to spray paint the border grey to my liking.",Neutral
"Don’t worth the price Too small for the price, for that price should be canvas, not just the paper",Neutral
Meh The lettering appears to be filled in with sharpie. It is very cheap aluminum. Was expecting something a bit weighty,Neutral
Cute but over priced The frame is cute. However the price is absolutely ridiculous. When it came in it looked like a homemade DIY that anyone would have been able to make with things from hobby lobby. Wish I would have gone and made it myself. Would have saved a ton of money.,Neutral
"Too tall for my Petit Noe It fit my Petit Noe width-wise, but it was too tall that it took away from the slouchy look and took away the ability to tie it. I modified it by making it shorter (by a few inches) and now it works with my bag. The pink color is nice. I ordered the petit noe size, so perhaps they sent me the wrong size, but I can’t tell by the packaging I received.",Neutral
Nice The prints have a few dark ink spots on them.  I may return them for new ones,Neutral
Not good material. This is not really a towel more like a piece of cloth.,Neutral

Cute but not as vibrant in color Gave as a gift. Friend loved them! I was expecting more of a vibrant color. Looks a little more pastel to me.,Neutral
Not a true red color I am a little disappointed in the bow. The red is not a true buffalo plaid red. It has a pinkish hue to it that will not match the red shirt that it was intended to match. It’s soft and stretchy and is comfortable for my daughter to wear.,Neutral
"Bottle was not full, otherwise it’s what I asked for. Bottle was not full, in photos the lane is different as well. I’ll rewrite a review after a couple weeks of working with it.",Neutral
"Larger than it looks & hard to put on I was hoping to try out a very small nose ring before purchase and this was bigger than I wanted and more importantly, hard to put on.",Neutral
Flimsy I like the look of these earrings they are just flimsy and easily loose their shape! They need to be made of better material that is thicker and sturdy. They are cute on I just don’t know how long they will last before they completely loose their shape. They are very light weight and comfortable. I probably wouldn’t have bought them if I would have known how flimsy they were though!,Neutral
Tiny! Cute but super tiny. I could barely get them over my earlobe.,Neutral
To thin and small . What I do not like it because is very thin.,Neutral
Not as bright as expected Stickers' color is not as bright and vivid as it appears. I think I could have just printed my own.,Neutral
"Wrong color So, when I was considering my order, I wanted light to medium brown color band with no ginger or yellow-ish shades.<br />The descriptions and photos looked good to me, but as the result I got this - it is exactly what I didn't want to get in color.<br />Quality is nice (don't really like hard leather bands, I prefer soft leather, but still it's fine) and I'm sure it lasts forever, but can't see it on my skin.",Neutral
Three Stars Good quality but color wasn't what I expected. Darker then I wanted,Neutral
Works good Works amazing will not smell like body order but will make you smell funny. I don't know how to describe but it will make you smell like spices. And not particularly good smell but not the worst. It works if it all you have .,Neutral
"Tons of compliments -Beautifully packaged as well The earrings and necklace are absolutely beautiful but the earrings are just a little bit too heavy. Craftsmanship is excellent and if the sea glass teardrops were cut in half, the earrings would be more lightweight.",Neutral

Three Stars Beautifull but mid part the family tree feel off lost,Neutral
Necklace broke way too quick Borderline for me. Great looking necklace and Hippo. Put it on daughter and poof 2 hrs later necklace is broke.,Neutral
"Cute but pay attention to sizing Well made and incredibly well packaged. This cookbook is a mini though. It's about the size of a small photo album. I thought it was going to be much larger but I guess I didn't pay attention to the dimensions if they were listed. The pages and lines are so small it practically renders the item useless for any recipe that has any complexity, so a little disappointed. I'm giving three stars because the item is very well made, pretty, VERY well packaged, and the shipping was prompt. I thought I had ordered an A4, but during customization options it/I must have defaulted back to the A6 sizing.",Neutral
"Okay The sign is very small.  Check measurements before you buy.  The finish is rust.  Nit painted, but truly rust.  You might want to paint if you don’t appreciate the rust.",Neutral
"Expensive, poor quality more sticker than decals Well I ordered the front and the back letters for my<br />Bronco and I order the carbon fiber decals but I received today my package and practically (and you can tell you a just a stickers, but since the white letters bother me I keep and install on my<br />Car from far looks so nice from close you can tell me a just stickers also I am afraid that it falling when I go to wash the car , to be honest not a good deal for tue price I pay $70 dlls. But I may try other color maybe looks better and no looks like a cheap sticker 😔",Neutral

Too small Nice color. Too small for adult,Neutral
"Did not use Some of the holes were too small fit the lollipop sticks I had. Also a part of the border on one side of it was chipped, as if when they were carving it, they made a mistake and felt like it was still ok to send. I was still going to use it until I saw some lollipop sticks could not fit. So i just used floral foam in the end.",Neutral
Disappointed with size color changed with wearing In the photo they looked appropriate for an adult woman. I would characterize them as more all for a toddler or child. I am wearing them now. They are definitely quite comfortable even when lying in bed. I will probably wear them as an everyday around the house don't think about taking them in and out earing. They are no longer silver colored. I wouldn't mind if they were just an ordinary stainless steel color but they have turned black!,Neutral
"Not worth the price I paid more for this one because I thought it would be a better quality.  The description said ""Engraved"" personalization.  Looks to me like it's mechanically stamped.<br />It didn't have a high gloss finish either. Falls apart when you try to hook up your phone to charge.<br />And to top it off it looks like the price was lowered  $8 after i paid for it!",Neutral
small for the cost I like the picture however for the size and no frame its a little on the expensive side. I found better looking photos at the dollar store There is nothing special about the paper and it looks like it was printed from the computer; then to top it all off before I even received the picture the price changed by 2 dollars. Just disappointed in the whole thing.,Neutral
"Great price, inaccurate color I like the size and style of this bag but was disappointed by the color. I ordered it in navy blue and it reads as a strong black.",Neutral

It's 2 bracelets, one bracelet has 2 rows of beads and one bracelet has 1 row of beads.  The tiger's eye is very shiny and pretty against the matte lava stones.  Very happy with these.",Positive

"Extremely happy and satisfied ! I am extremely happy and satisfied with the custom sign I just received. Jason at 3D Woodworker was so gracious as to accommodate my special requests and I was able to communicate with him multiple time along the process. Delivery of the completed sign was done a week before the deadline. Carving of my favorite phrase was beautifully done on good quality wood and I just love it.  Nice job and thanks again, Jason!",Positive
"Great little item! No more cold/hot hands I bought this item as a gift for myself and I love them, no more cold or wet hands from cold drinks.",Positive
"Fantastic EDC pocket organizer. The materials and build quality of this particular pocket organizer are exceptional.  The brown leather is thick, durable and carries well.  The leather has worn around my tools and even holds the shape once they’re removed.  Placing them back in elicits an audible sound that I can only describe as comparable to holstering a firearm or knife into a good kydex holster.<br /><br />The materials supersede the price.  I have several of their products and will continue to be a repeat customer.  The products also arrived earlier than listed.<br /><br />***It should be noted that there’s a significant different in the thickness and quality of the brown leathers they use and the black ones.  Black leather is much thinner and doesn’t hold up as well as the thicker brown options. Sticking is also kinda loose due to the weaker leather. Attached photos show some of the differences in thickness.  There is a significant step DOWN in quality when ordering the black leather version of this product.<br /><br />5 stars for the brown version<br />2 stars for the black version",Positive
Really cute! They look really cute on my shoes!,Positive

Gets the point across in a cute way Better than I hoped. We live on a walking path and just had some trees planted. Some owners think the yard is their dog’s toilet so I wanted to get the point across without being obnoxious. It’s worked perfectly and I think it’s because they’re bright/friendly and not a crude message like so many signs. Hand painted too - each one is a little different. They’re sturdy and thick and both are holding up in the rain. Happy to recommend.,Positive

"Turned out great I wanted this a bit customized.  I added a color stone and a couple more letters.  I had to contact the seller to figure out how to do the add-on's.

"Beautiful but delicate Everything about it is perfect except for the string; the one chosen makes the piece rather breakable, especially if using them as mala/prayer beads. On the plus side, it also makes using it as such very quiet which is useful if you meditate at times where it was best you weren't a nuisance (small spaces, late hours).. Being smaller beads, it is also a bit more classy, and less in your face than most mala beads, for if you wish to use it in public without as much judgment from others",Positive
Add a symbol option please Very cute! I do wish there was an option to pick the symbols that I wanted because I asked for a nautical symbol and got an anchor when I wanted a compass haha. Very quick service and a nice quality for the price.,Positive

Yorkie Mom Tshirt Very pleased with this soft T-shirt. Good fit and well made. Great color choices!,Positive
"Really cool! Excellent cnc cuts on all of the components and it was well packaged. No damage and the custom laser work was spot on. The ONLY suggestion I would make is to offer options for the hands, out of the box it comes with black hour and minute hands, which are nice and right sized, but the sweeping second hand is fire engine red. I think offering a choice of hand designs/colors would put that last finished touch on the piece. Otherwise, great product.",Positive
Love! My mom loves these. She says the scent is a thousand times better than the store bought ones. Would definitely purchase again!,Positive
Five Stars My daughter loved it! Plan on ordering more!,Positive

The earrings were hard to get in and they kept falling out. I think they were rejecting. Anywho, that all stopped when I got this L shaped piercing. It was easy to get in and once in it stayed in. I’ve only had it in for about a week now and my piercing is fully healed and it hasn’t come out at all. Now I only want to were this type of piercing. Hopefully I can find more just with different studs.",Positive

The triangle arrived in a reasonable amount of time, was already assembled, and is well made and sturdy. Most importantly, our (very active) 16 month old loved it immediately! It's a great addition to our small apartment.<br /><br />ETA - reducing one star after several months of use, because the lack of a latch or lock feature is nerve-wracking. It easily slides closed when my toddler leans against it and can fall over. We are trying to figure out a DIY lock method.",Positive

Well made I am very impressed with the quality of this leather cover. It’s super handsome and feels great. i just started bullet journaling and it definitely makes me want to keep it with me and write in it. I loved the ability to add my name in the bottom corner and it was the right size and font. I was sad when I got the first scratch on it as it seems like a magnet to them but console myself with the fact that I am making it mine which will not look exactly the same as anyone else’s. I would highly recommend this product and seller.,Positive

The scent is perfect for a man, but would work well for woman.  I ordered the Dragon's Blood scent from De'esse Boutique also, which is another scent that works well for men.

"A wallet for a lifetime Great Christmas gift for my husband. I was sick of purchasing a new wallet for him every year. There is no stitching and the leather is thick and not made from smaller pieces so it really looks like it will last for many years. Personalized and custom made. I paid $85 and would do so again.  I'm sick of paying $25 for a wallet that lasts maybe 2 yrs. I did a lot of research before buying this product. Wonderful, American made, created by a true craftsman instead of in a sweatshop and sold by a major corp.",Positive
Good print Good print. I was hoping for something larger. Didn’t read size correct. Will work just fine,Positive
"Very cute, but be careful! I loved how my cake topper came out. The colors are true to what you see and the glitter isn't glitter that comes off. The only con is that they're a little flimsy I mean it is paper...I almost ripped it when trying to put on the stick. So just be careful!",Positive
Just what she wanted. Bought these for my sister's Baby Shower.  They were perfect and she loved them.,Positive

Five Stars Perfect and they custom colored it for us..just what our spa needed!,Positive
"Not for a significant other, but a great gift for girls up to age 12 This is simpler designed costume jewelry. While the quality is really decent, it’s obvious it’s not real and my nieces have asked to borrow it for theater and dress up. May order another so they have one!",Positive

It’s relatively small, like regular letter paper sized, but printed on thick paper, and comes in a protective clear sleeve. Very cute addition to the festivities.",Positive
Perfect Beautiful!!,Positive
"Would buy more!! Fantastic product! I bought two pairs of earrings. In the package was a hand written note that made this buying experience even more heartfelt. I had purchased the earring for my school districts Disney day. Their products are reasonably priced, well packaged, good quality, and I would buy more from them! I’m relieved to find a product that I can use with my allergies. The previous review was placed on this item but was meant for another product. My mom had written it about a pasta machine she purchased. So disregard the “ negative “ comments by my mom Joann Mosher they were in error.",Positive

"Gold-filled square initial tag necklace I bought this necklace in rose gold and have worn it constantly since receiving it over three weeks ago. Even through many showers, the necklace looks as good as it did the day I first put it on. The chain does tangle up if I wear it with another necklace, so I've just been wearing it alone. I get lots of compliments on the necklace, and I like the look of the square tag. I purchased it in the 16 inch length",Positive
Beautiful My husband loved this soooo much. Amazing gift for him,Positive
Super sturdy It took a while to come in but it was totally worth the wait,Positive
"Just what I was looking for A couple things to note:<br />-The folio arrived from China packaged very nicely. They took a lot of care to prevent damage during shipping.<br />-The folio is well made. I used to own a Saddleback medium notepad holder but sold it on eBay because it was just too big and heavy to fit anywhere. This straddles the line perfectly between high quality leather and portability.<br />-The legal pads they recommend you use are 8.5x11.75. When you tear the sheets out they are normal 8.5 x 11.<br /><br />There was a little bit of oil on the folio when I received it, presumably from conditioner they applied before shipping. At least they took the time to apply it. Recommend you take a dry rag and wipe it down, otherwise you might get some staining on your papers for a few days.<br /><br />Great company!",Positive
Great products Great products...thanks for the soap samples!,Positive
"Excellent quality, beautiful beadwork I do not have a swan like neck and these are the perfect length. The quality is amazing, I have purchased four different pairs and they are all beautiful.",Positive
"Quality Product The noodle board is made of natural wood and the custom wording was able to capture my thoughts. I used this as a cover to the shelves above the stove, and placed hinges on the top.  I am planning to make it look like a continuous vent hood, and without the hurricane damage on the walls.",Positive

"LOOOOOVE!!!! LOVE THIS NECKLACE!!! That’s all I can say. I’ve gotten 2, the first one I lost jumping into a lake during the summer. Ordered a second once the minute I realized I lost it. I felt naked without it! I wear this everyday. Part of the threading on the rope/chain peeled off but doesn’t bother me at all. Definitely recommend!",Positive

"Nicely done, but not exactly what I expected I am not familiar with bright satin finish sterling, so it's my fault for my ignorance. The piece is matte finish. Not like traditional sterling jewelry with mirror finish shine. So it looks like a non-descript metal instead of sterling to me. I believe it is what is being described (925 sterling silver) but this review is just to inform others that it's not glossy. That's probably on purpose to avoid fingerprints. It was well made, heart cut in the right place, engraving looks fine, comes in a cute little box and packaged well. Thanks!",Positive

I came across the personalized recipe cards and thought it was perfect. The product was simple, but beautiful. It was well made and would stand up to getting flour and sugar on it. You are able to title the cards anyway you like and it blends nicely with the other print. It doesn't look like an after thought. I was amazed how fast it was shipped to me during the Christmas holiday. The price was reasonable for a personalized product. My mother in-law loved it.",Positive

"Lightweight, beautiful and great quality silent clock This clock is so beautiful! I had seen one like it on Pinterest and knew I wanted it for my unborn son's nursery 🥰. It works great and does not tick but the second hand just glides along the ring. I'm confused that the rating asks about thickness as this as a very lightweight and thin clock but well made! Very easy to hang and super attractive. Only complaint is the second hand came in a bit bent. It came a long way and was carefully packaged so I'm not deducting stars for that. Very happy with this item!",Positive

"Unique and Special This set of four hanging urchin air plants came in a lovely draw string bag, well wrapped and perfectly healthy. Included is a card with care instructions for the air plants.<br /><br />I took many pictures so you get a feel for what they look like in different lighting. I chose to hang the urchins in a bathroom window and I smile whenever I see them. Each urchin is a different size with unique finials at the top. The line they hang on is the same length for each and have small crystals on them. A hook at the top makes them easy to hang.<br /><br />The largest urchin is a lavender/white with a large green air plant. The next size to the largest and the smallest urchins are light orange. The one next sized to the largest has a lovely air plan that is a silvery green on the top with a reddish color on the underside of the plant. The super unique urchin is a light purple/white with little nubs. The finial is larger than the other ones and the plant is more of the type I've seen before. Because each is so different, they really add character and the varying shapes of the plants give the illusion of movement.<br /><br />When I took a picture for my mom, she said it looked like they were in an aquarium. If you love unique items, you will love this. It is absolutely worth the price in my book and would make a lovely gift.",Positive

"Everything I wanted in a walking stick! I ordered the 40"" (with blue handle) diamond willow walking stick and, boy, was I delighted in the quality craftmanship of my stick. There were oodles of diamonds in the wood--it looked great! I also love the handle--it fits my hand perfectly. I'm physically disabled and wanted a walking stick in lieu of the crappy metal crutch I've been using for years. This stick works perfectly, from it's cushiony braided wrist strap to it's no-slip rubber bottom. I couldn't ask for a better stick. Plus, the maker was approachable and easy to contact!",Positive

When my 3rd baby came along, my 2nd bird had somehow gotten lost. I contacted the company again and they were again happy to work with me on getting 2 more baby birds.<br />Keeping them on speed-order for baby #4 - in a couple years!",Positive

"Nice quality leather bracelet This is an Amazon Vine review of the Tongnan mens leather bracelet (style ‘B’)<br />  I’ve been wanting to get one of these bracelets for a while, but never pulled the trigger until now.  I loosely measured my wrist and then purchased the 8.07” version, and it fits perfectly!  The bracelet comes in a nice case actually, I was impressed immediately when I unpackaged this item, the case is very nice.  I’m also very pleased with the fit and comfort of this bracelet.  The leatherwork is nicely done, and all the beads are tightly in place, which is a plus.  I did have a little bit of difficulty trying to get the clasp on with my one remaining hand.  It’s not impossible, but it is a little difficult for sure, I’m sure I’ll get better at it, and I do like the clasp, it is also nicely constructed.  I am afraid that one of the times when I put it on. I’m going to pull a hair or two out of my arm as the clasp closes, but it hasn’t happened yet!  All in all, I like the bracelet and will be wearing it quite regularly.",Positive

"Big, cute, but couldn’t keep Super cute. It ended up arriving broken and I didn’t order a new one because it didn’t fit where I had to put it (due to another outlet cover nearby) which is my fault. I was able to return it and was refunded easily and the seller was very kind. 4/5 stars because it dies look better in pictures than in person and is a bit more fragile than expected.",Positive

"A+ Excellent quality bracelet !! Beautiful and showy bracelet. Interesting clasp mechanism that my wife was able to secure with one hand.  More than large enough for my arm, fastens down to small enough for her wrist.  Very cool design for how the different beads are held in place.  Feels substantial on your wrist similar to a quality watch and band.  I appreciate the mix of Tigers Eye, Hematite and black Obsidian.",Positive

"Lovely but NOT an authentic dictionary page print I purchased the jellyfish dictionary wall art print in conjunction with products from 3 other companies who produce comparable images to create a 30 image gallery wall. Having said that, this was the only image that I purchased that was on photo paper. I was surprised, but I’m putting it in a frame so it shouldn’t be noticeable. I would almost argue that it makes this print more giftable, because it’s not as delicate. However it was disappointing that it wasn’t an authentic dictionary page.  This was one of my more muted prints and I was worried that the colors would be too soft to stand out from 29 other images.  The image quality is awesome!  It has a nice saturation to the colors.",Positive

"Worth the purchase Came to me very quick, which is always appreciated! It's the 16&#34;x20&#34; size. Only minus one star because its very hard to know what color you're getting with the color chart.  We got 29 & 44. The pink color is slightly off from what I was expecting. The gray tone is just right. We're using 3- 4 different colors for the wedding dayand can't wait to see it finished!  Habent tried the download links yet to say if they're good/bad.",Positive
"The Most Magical Ring On Amazon Absolutely stunning ring. When I first ordered this, I was expecting a fake stone made with some janky sticker and a muddy piece of plastic but what arrived was absolutely magical. Definitely living for the handmade touches done by the artist! I cannot rave enough about this product and this retailer. I will definitely be purchasing here again in the future for myself or for my friends because I know these guys won’t disappoint.",Positive
This a beautiful well-crafted shelf. We ordered this to give as a birthday gift. The person who received it is quite happy with it and has several bottles of whiskey in it.

High Quality I am very happy to write this review. The scrabble letters were just as described and they arrived well packaged and in tact.  The quality was excellent and gave an edge above the others because of the deeply carved letters also light enough to hang with command strips .  I absolutely loved it and frankly for the quality and size of the tiles its was worth the money spent. Thank you guys for add-in value to my modern farmhouse look!,Positive
Numbers looked good They were fine. I returned them because we decided on a different style. Everything was fine and they looked just as expected.,Positive
"Good Quality, Great Sticking Factor on Car Windows! Almost exactly a year ago, I ordered this decal sticker in the #10 font, 4&#34; high with purple glitter to personalize the back window of my SUV. I love almost everything about it! Up until about a month ago, it was still perfect. Then it started getting some spots on it, likely from weather and car washes (although I do live in San Diego, so we mostly have nice temperatures with sunny skies). It still looks fine from a car length away, but up close you can tell. In any case, I don't mind spending $17.50 annually to have a cute personalization on my car!",Positive
Gift The couple loved it!!,Positive
Good Experience The item was just as nice as it's online photo indicated.  The friend I gave the necklace to was delighted.,Positive
So cute and well done! I love this felt garland. So cute and done well. I wish I would have seen these listings previously to me buying similar ones on Etsy for over double the price!

"your picture/advertising should be altered! I love jade, the lighter the jade, the more expensive it is, this bracelet is really pretty, but too much marble to say it’s perfect, the beads are not uniform, and if I hadn’t known so much about jade, I would not have known these defects, but it’s still a pretty bracelet, I’m hesitant to tell anyone it’s real jade as I have a real jade bracelet & I know what real jade looks like.  But I love the bracelet despite it’s flaws!",Positive

Perfect. At first I was a little nervous because there was only 100 reviews but I decided to order this item because it was personalized vs a standard guestbook that are available at big companies/stores. It came in packed very secured and the item was perfect. We love it and are excited to be able to also display this personalized item in our home vs putting it away in a box after the wedding.,Positive

"Just as advertised - great packaging - little big for EDC Great product - looks just as advertised. Comes in very nice little packaging - which isn't all to important, but it's a nice indication that they take pride in their work. Seems very sturdy and will last a lifetime - I've only had it a day, I'll update my review if it starts falling apart, but I doubt it.<br /><br />There are a few negatives - but only specifically for my use case. I had the idea of using this as a sort of pocket wallet replacement - and it seems like that won't be a great idea with this. The leather is quite thick (about .8cm on either side) and the texture is fairly grippy, making it a pain to take in and out of pockets. But the product is as advertised, and I can't really complain that it doesn't fit in my pocket, when I knew the size before I bought it.<br /><br />Another minor point is that the pen loop (I opted for the larger pen loop) makes it fold a little more asymmetrically - but that might go away when it's broken in.",Positive

I am in love with these earrings.",Positive
"Stay On Top Of Your Home! I use a large MAMBI Happy Planner and these fit perfectly. My house is always either clean and tidy or disorganized—and I hate having to clean everything at once.

Beautiful rings great quality Beautiful rings great quality. The only problem was I ordered them a little too big so I will have to take them to a jeweler to make smaller. I did call and leave a message With the owner regarding resizing and did not get a callback.

"BEST GIFT EVER! I'm an unemployed 16 year old, and I really wanted to get my mom a meaningful gift for Christmas, so I stumbled upon this, and I decided to add the $10 for 3 heart charms, and chose a gold finish and engrave my siblings and I's initials. It is absolutely adorable, and I can't wait to give her it. The chain was shorter than I expected, so if someone favors longer necklaces go for the chain longer than 17.5 because that's what I got, but I still think it's cute! I love it!!

I put the brown pair in right before I left the house today and noticed a little after an hour later they were both gone. Wish they would have put the clear stoppers on the backs of all the earrings to secure them, so they don’t fall out of your ears. Now my favorite pair is gone. Guess I’m going to go search for some of the clear stoppers before I end up losing the other two pairs.",Positive

"Really cute, fits great & washable. They arrived early, and are exactly as I requested- one each of the hummingbird styles. The maker took time to cut the fabric so the birds are flying upright, too.<br />They're really cute- sturdy quilting cotton, with the nose wire & slider pocket on back to insert my filters. I chose the elastic loops instead of ties, my wear time is short periods. Maker used white elastic for the light material, and black for the dark material. I stuck a pen down inside the pocket of the dark one so you can see.<br />I'll wash these by hand, soak with laundry rinse disinfectant sanitizer, then hang dry (100% cotton WILL shrink in the heat of a dryer- who didn't know that?).<br />Very happy with my purchase!",Positive

Nice gift I thought this was a nice little pre Christmas gift to give my husband to always remember our first Christmas as a married couple. He agreed.,Positive
"Decent quality charm, but even smaller than you might expect in real life The charm is surprisingly small.  I hate to take off more than one star for this, because after all it SHOULDN'T be too surprising since there are pictures of it right next to a ruler!  However, I own a similar violin pendant that I really love, which is the exact same length.  I had that in mind when ordering this.  But one thing you have to bear in mind for is the fact that a clarinet is little more than a thin cylindrical tube.  Due to the thinness of the design's width, it's going to feel a lot smaller than other charms of the same length.<br /><br />This is a nice quality pendant (although the chain is basically a throwaway).  But it might work better on a charm bracelet.  As a necklace pendant, people have to be leaning in pretty close to tell that it's a clarinet.",Positive

"Beautiful!  Highly recommend this product. I've been a fan of the Dodge Ram for many, many years.  When I learned that Custom Car Posters was making a ram generations poster I had to get it!  I purchased the 24"" x 36"", with blue trucks, on satin paper.  You can see in the picture that it came out great!  The frame actually decreases the quality a bit, as the Target-brand frame I put it in is somewhat translucent rather than transparent.  The poster is sharper out of this frame.<br /><br />When I received the poster originally (I received it within a week, by the way -- don't be discouraged by the lead time quoted by Amazon) the box was unfortunately damaged in transit and the poster was badly crimped as a result.  The crew at Custom Car Posters immediately made me another one and shipped it with improved shipping materials.  They mentioned that USPS is generally very reliable, from a quality standpoint, in their experience.<br /><br />My box came with a thank-you card as well as a sheet of fun car stickers!  Too bad there weren't any Rams on the sticker, but, knowing this is a newer design for them it is not surprising that their existing stickers don't yet have the ram truck on them.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with the quality of the poster and the support experience I've had with CCP.",Positive
Happy Find! Love these little ear rings. I gave them as a graduation gift to a friend’s daughter. They are dainty and sparkly so they add a bit of fun to any outfit. They are pretty enough to wear with a dressy outfit as well. Great product and well made!,Positive

"I couldn't ask for more!  Amazing! My order was placed late in the evening. The next day it was made to my specifications and shipped!  I received it two days later!  How can they get a hand made product to me so fast?!<br /><br />I've been looking for a nice leather cover for my Moleskine Cahier notebook for some time. I wanted something simple and elegant without too much bulk. There are a few covers on the market but this one seemed most like what I wanted. The customization options were a bonus, I thought.<br /><br />My notebook cover arrived neatly wrapped in brown paper and string with a note thanking me for my order.  This cover is made of soft leather that's about 2mm thick with inside pockets that are made of 1mm leather. The feel reminds me of a good baseball glove, soft but sturdy.  The single row of stitching around the perimeter is consistent and neat. I can't tell where the maker started or ended.  The personalized lettering is deep and consistent. This product is much more attractive than the asking price reflects, and because it has custom features, it feels like I designed it!  It's mine!<br /><br />I was surprised to find that a genuine Moleskine Cahier lined notebook was installed in the cover already!  Those things are over $3USD making this an even better value!<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I can't recommend this maker enough!  Bravo!",Positive
"Great gift I received this as a gift. I loved the smell,  consistency, and packaging of the products so much that I came back to purchase a set for myself.",Positive
Looks great ! Better than I expected. Good work. Glad I waited for shipment to arrive. Took 10 days I think. I use iPhone Max.

Upon receipt of it, I ordered 3 more pieces from the same artist and all have arrived and have made a stunning addition to our home.

"Nice product but need alternate way to install. I gave 4stars because they are nice but the double face tape just doesn't work in a cold environment and there aren't holes drilled so you can screw it onto the house, therefore they are no longer on the house.  Otherwise they are the perfect size, were shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.",Positive

"Good product, recommended for extended sessions The mat unrolls easily and stays flat. It is a good thickness and stays put on the table. It has a semi-matte finish that is easy on the eyes and keeps cards in place (my cards are not sleeved). I played a few games and it didn't help me beat the Minotaur, but the mat is good quality and recommended.  Definitely a good buy for long sessions. Note this is a solo mat.",Positive

"Nighty Night Sleep Tight My teen son has always loved extra pressure on him and we wanted to try something other than a weighted blanket as they can get hot in the summer.  We put the sheet easily on the bed (easy if two people do it bc you have to lift the mattress ) and our son slept in the sheets and woke saying he loved them. He’s been using the sheet for about 2 weeks and yes, there are times he pops out of the sheet in his sleep but he still says he loves the sheet, so it’s a keeper !  Thanks to the creator of this gem!",Positive

"So happy! Amazing! Great Quality. It came on time, I ordered 4 at once, this is the only one that came when it was supposed to. It came in a yellow Amazon envelope with bubbles. Protected inside with a clear sleeve and a cardboard insert to keep it from bending. The dictionary page is legit, it is double sided and thankfully the image is on an even number...I have a bit of OCD, having to see the 915 would drive me nuts. lol. The image is crisp and I love it. I hope the person I got this for loves it too!<br />*Edit* I do want to add, I did have a little mishap. the clear sleeve it comes in has an adhesive flap, as I was taking the art out of the sleeve to put it into a frame the adhesive flap decided to make out with the top of the picture. It is literally a thing page from a dictionary, so I had to carefully pull them apart. Thankfully I was able to remove it without it ripping or damaging the picture....I held my breath and stuck my tongue out....it was terrifying, but I can't wait for my other orders to come in. I now know to flip the flap and stick it to itself before trying to remove...learn from my mishap!",Positive

I ended up just doing trees without a star, which still turned out super cute .",Positive
"Great quality, but the letter G is well Anyone who says this isn't good quality construction is wrong.  It is thick sheet metal, and it is excellent quality.  My only issue is with the font they used for the letter ""G""  I  think it looks more like the lower case ""g"" myself.  My wife says it's fine, but I am a little more critical.  I would give this product 5 stars, if it were for the font.",Positive

Nice bohemian style print Nice print. Please note the print is a little larger than 8x10; you will need to trim it to fit a frame. I’ve got an eclectic grouping of prints and franes on the wall and this will be a good addition.,Positive
Don't hesitate This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and nourished. I love the fact that it doesn't come in a plastic bottle. I will be using this and their shampoo from now on.,Positive
AMAZING Love this necklace and works so well fit great and is so cute,Positive
"Beautiful white moonstones with that special shimmer. The earrings are beautiful, and the stones are lovely and well-matched.  They are large enough to be noticed, but still look sophisticated.  They have that moonstone look that is like a cloudy opal - not as blue as in the product photo, but more white as I expect moonstones to be - just what I wanted.  They are very nice, and the silver is excellent quality.  Also, they came double wrapped in plastic and placed inside a little plastic box.  The packaging protected them well.  They came very quickly.  Thank you!",Positive

"Beautiful, delicate, elegant I loved this necklace and the saying that came with it was perfect. We had a foster daugther many years ago who has grown up to a beautiful woman inside and out. We are much closer today than when she lived with us and I wanted something special for her on her wedding day. This was the gift I chose and she loved it.  Although I couldn't give it to her before she was getting ready on her big day and I wasn't sure if she had a different necklace picked out to wear,  she said she wanted to wear this necklace and it made my heart soar.",Positive
Beautifully made! Got two of these as a “little something” for my anniversary with my husband. They’re beautifully made! The engraving is perfect and doesn’t wear away. We haven’t taken them off one time in two months and the chains haven’t broken. Definitely worth the money :),Positive
would look into it awesome prints. Walmart sells perfect fit frames for like $2.,Positive
"you're gonna get jealous looks I was expecting a cheap piece of plastic, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite hefty and solidly built.<br /><br />Depending on your door, you may have to get creative in order to install it. I can tell you right now that a few strips of double sided foam tape are strong enough to hold it up.<br /><br />Looks cool, and since your guests might not notice until they're leaving your place, it's a nice surprise right before they go home. Awesome gift idea!",Positive
Nice gift for golfing Very special ...,Positive
Beautiful with beautiful packaging. I absolutely love this bracelet. I wear it almost daily.,Positive

So cute So cute but made out of a Dollat Tree towel and potholder,Positive
"Nice Look This was lighter than I was expecting just based on the picture (lol) but it's sturdy enough to hold up a couple large dog harnesses and collars. It looks nice on the wall, so it's one of those cute AND functional decorations.<br />Disclaimer: I have not hung anything that heavy on this (more than 5 lbs.).",Positive
"Beautiful Got this necklace for my mom as a mother’s Day gift and she loved it! Very beautiful, sturdy, and exactly as expected. Delivered earlier than planned which is always a bonus.",Positive
Drinking glass with cat design Seems to be sturdy enough yet looks nice.<br />Perfect size for my drink with ice.<br />Cute designs of cat that my grand daughters loved.,Positive

"Smaller than shown Way smaller than picture depicts, should've read the description but there was no option to change the size so I assumed it would be that size. Hopefully it sticks well it's a Christmas present.",Positive
Very nice for the price They are very nice for the price,Positive
Love them! Love these earrings and I get so many compliments EVERY time I wear them! So glad I found them!,Positive
"These make great gifts. Have purchased 4 so far and each has been well made, delivered promptly and sized right. Have given these as gifts with coordinating teapots.  The price is reasonable compared to other cozies that are $7.00 more and require almost $10.00 additional to ship. (you can purchase the teapot with your savings)  I love that they are handmade here in the USA.",Positive
"Amazing how this can be made. What a great gift for any nature lover, my friend loved her gift.",Positive
"A great Gilmore Girl memento! For any Gilmore Girl fan, The Life and Death Brigade and their motto &#34;In Omnia Paratus&#34; (ready for all things) was a key point in Rory's life.  I wear this on my right ring finger and when I look at it, I smile. I am reminded of one of my fave Rory episodes and in turn, I feel uplifted. Sturdy, yet weightless when worn, the ring is well made. A great value, it shipped quickly and it's a must for any G.G. fan!",Positive
"Pleasant surprise I had gotten this for my father in law for Christmas. Honestly I was reall worried about the quality, but he loves his Harley's. Once he opened it, he lost it because they were so beautiful.... The quality of the photos were A Lot better than expected and i highly recommend these",Positive

"Just what I wanted! I was looking for a small hoop for my cartilage and had been having a difficult time finding something that would work the way I wanted. I took a chance on these because they seemed to measure how I wanted. Once I got it in, I was so happy. They cover the ear just the way I wanted and look good and dainty just as I was hoping.",Positive
"Great update to my tired kitchen I didn't know there was a product like this till I saw it highlighted in an Amazon list of items from artists in different states. I looked under Tennessee, my state, out of curiosity and saw this. I have a flat top range which has wear and tear, it works fine, but the top just didn't look great. This is the perfect solution, plus it gives a little more work space without the risk of further damaging the range top. The color is beautiful. I absolutely love it.",Positive
A beautiful memorial with custom engraving I can't say enough about this touching bracelet.<br />It's a wonderful memorial.<br />Many thanks for the customized engraving,Positive

Cute and great quality!! Awesome personalization!!!,Positive
"Loved it! My husband and I absolutely loved it, I got him the wooded box with his initials on both the wallet and the box and they are beautiful. I was expecting it here by mid June and It arrived earlier. The quality of the wallet is excellent",Positive
"THE sweetest and closest to perfection a gift can possibly be... I am so impressed and in love with this personalized gift for my partner of 1 year. I think I totally nailed it by choosing this for the traditional first anniversary gift of paper. It is so perfect in its simplicity.<br /><br />You can choose any city for the map no matter how remote and unknown it may be. The city location is centered perfectly within the heart so one definitely knows to which special location is being referred. The shadow box frame is an absolutely gorgeous final touch to the piece.<br /><br />Some reviews I've read are from customers that have claimed this is a piece they could have made themselves; if so, I wonder why they wasted their time complaining about this fact in their reviews if they knew that. They must have a lot of extra time on their hands. Even if I could and wanted to take the time out of my busy schedule to do this myself, the price is totally worth it because Define Design 11 sells EXCELLENT and EXCEPTIONAL customer service. To me, the level of customer service is one of the most important aspects of a company and Define Design 11 delivers in spades. They are so prompt with responding to inquiries and happily accommodating customer requests.<br /><br />I highly recommend Define Design 11 if you want the perfect gift created for your loved one. I know my partner and I will treasure this piece for the rest of this life.",Positive

My fiancé loves it and every-time he sees it, he comments on how great this idea is. Thank you for such a great, high quality product! We’ll for sure be ordering another for our next milestone :)",Positive
Sweet smell Its has a nice fruity floral smell and i don’t usually like fruity/floral.,Positive
"Bottles are smaller than I expected For 40.00 I did expect a little bit larger bottles, I have long hair almost to my butt and I use a lot of shampoo and conditioner when I wash my hair, and the bottles are smaller than I expectd, but that being said it is a cleansing shampoo. It did make my hair soft and it did not tangle, which for me is a plus.<br /><br />There is tea tree oil in it and boy that smell is stong. It is not a bad smell but wow that tes tree oil comes out and overpowers the other scents in the shampoo, it is not as strong in the conditioner. The tea tree oil does tingle your scalp which was unexpected but nice, it is almost like cooling, but when I rinsed it out I could tellthe difference, it did get the build up out of my hair and the conditioner made it soft and easy to comb through.<br /><br />I am very pleased so far.",Positive
"Hermoso [[VIDEOID:8270ad131eaf551cf248e9b26d2a1ad9]] Mi madre me regaló este anillo por su piedra ya que es la piedra de acuario, lo espectacular es q lo ajustas a tu medida",Positive

"Fantastic Real Copper Product! I searched for real copper for our 7th anniversary. When I came upon this i liked the fact I could chat through text message with the creator directly. Shipping was quick, on time and hassle free. I like to buy US products when possible and this was, what feel was a fantastic deal! I can clearly see the passion of the creator in this work of art. I recommend RefreshingArt.com to everyone.<br />Any photo I take wouldn't do it the justice it deserves. Image is stock from amazon",Positive

Love Love Love it Love Love Love it!! We bought the decal with the wing attachments to the ends and it looks fabulous in our new nursery!! It is large so I needed my husbands help to put it up because we did not want any bubbles when we stuck it to the wall.

They arrived quickly and feel good quality. Packaged tightly to avoid damage. I already have both my boys’ pictures in them, and they look fantastic! Would definitely recommend!",Positive
"I made some awesome personalized ornaments!! This was a great product to make personalized ornaments for our tree.

Beautiful bracelet The bracelet is beautiful! I loved it. The material is good quality. The packaging was great as well. Only thing I would change is maybe the string being a little thicker still very pretty. Thank you!,Positive
I have not tried on yet. Will change from 4 to 5 rating as soon as I wear them. But the size and color is exactly what I wanted. I have a lot of hair and it is hard to see earrings even tho I have short hair.  But so far I am happy with these earrings.,Positive

"Food is the heart of every culture As a native Cajun, it is important to keep our heritage alive. Our language is dying, as well as our culture.  The parties we attended as young children are vastly different than the ones we had in the 60’s & 70’s.  My own children are no longer taught French in school.  I learned from kindergarten on up as well as at home.  Our everyday patois is being lost and that breaks my heart. So it is up to us to keep our own traditions alive.  And that begins with our food.",Positive

Lovely and Exactly as Expected Very pretty earrings. Not heavy.,Positive
"Amazing packaging for a gift! Lovely dainty choker necklace This dainty necklace with three pale jade beads is a wonderful everyday piece and a really great gift idea. I got this for myself, but it would make a really beautiful gift for a friend, sister, daughter, etc. because the presentation is wonderful. The necklace comes on a standard board, but it is encased inside a 3D display frame and comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth and a cute ""Thank You"" note with ""To"" and ""From"" printed on the inside. The necklace in its frame would look amazing in a gift basket. The card also has useful information such as cleaning and care for the jade and the silver, e.g., keep it away from pools, hot tubs, perfumes, and sunscreen; store it in an airtight ziplock; do not overpolish.<br />On me, the necklace FITS like a loose choker at its tightest, which is perfect for the office, and it has ~2"" of extra chain for a looser fit.<br />The only CON is that the closure is one of the smallest I've seen, and it may be difficult for people with dexterity issues.",Positive
Perfect Exactly as described. Great quality,Positive
"Dainty and cute I love this necklace - it’s so pretty and dainty.  Looks great with anything I wear, and it’s a constant reminder of a little hummingbird who visits me in my yard.",Positive

"A Bit Too Big I really like the headband and I wear it quite often, however, each strand could be wider/thicker - it sort of blends in and gets lost when I wear braids/twists. And the headband size is a bit big.<br /><br />I have an average size head and I have to adjust the headband to rest on my forehead a particular way because if I just place it on, it will fall off.<br /><br />I understand that for health and comfortability, the headband cannot be too tight but the elastics in back should help stretch out the headband if needed.",Positive

I origionally bought this sign to go with my 1 year old son’s birthday theme (didn’t really think about using it afterwards) but it’s so perfect that it will go right into his room on display after the party.

"This Is The Way! Mudhorn ""Beskar"" Vinyl Decals. The Mudhorn Vinyl decals arrived today.  I was impressed!  I went right out and applied them to the Givi windscreen on my Royal Enfield 650cc Interceptor.  I put them on the windscreen.  At first, I was worry about applying them without bumps, but I found the decals ""forgiving"" and I could carefully lift and reposition.  It is in the 30*Fs in the garage today.  The decal on the left would not stick to the plexiglass, so I got a hair dryer and lightly warmed the back of the holding material to warm it up.  Then it stuck nicely.  I did use a credit card to smooth the decal and then rubbed with a soft cotton cloth.  Everything I hoped for and goes well with my Mascot ""Baby Yoda"" who usually sits on the tail carrier of my bike.<br />I recommend these decals for your windscreen!",Positive
Pretty Cool! I ordered these for my wife. We wondered how she would look with a nose ring and now we know! The rings fit well and don't fall out easily. Nice that there are several colors. So now she can have a nose ring or an extra earring without having the piercing. The rings seem to be  good quality items. Well worth it.,Positive

"Unbelievable Quality I have purchased over 40 frames by carved by heart and can assure you they are top quality. In my opinion the chips fit better than they do in the overpriced Harley frames. I get all kinds of compliments on these frames and will continue to buy them as they are that good.<br /><br />As for the person who rated these a two, it is your own fault you cannot read when it clearly says there is no frame included. Why would you give them a 2 because you cannot read?",Positive
"Love love love these! 😍 These Emoji Wine Charms are fantastic! The seller is every talented as quick! I had the item in my hand way before I was supposed to. They are packaged nicely in a box and ready for gifting and/or storage (whatever you choose). They are so cute! They automatically bring a smile to your face. Each friend can have their own emoji charm that fits their personality. They are a great conversation piece. They are very well made. They feel like a mini button with very strong magnets. Each charm has a magnet, and you fasten it to the glass by aligning another magnet inside of the glass. Put it near the top so it won't be in the wine. I don't see them falling off or sliding down. This magnets are super strength and once aligned they aren't going anywhere. I struggled with the magnets getting stuck inside the back button portion, but a piece of flatware will fix that. Once you pry it a bit it sticks to the knife (or fork or spoon). These are a perfect gift for the person in your life that has wine parties, even if that person is you. 😜<br /> I hope you have found this review helpful to you.

"Great Quality Product! When I married my wife years ago, she taught me very quickly that quality often outweighs quantity. Since then, I've developed a bit of a taste for all things quality. This my friends, is a quality leather envelope/wallet. When I first removed the product from the box, there was a little oil soaked into the lid, but that never deterred me. Being a newly made, full grain leather product, you would expect a bit of the oil to still be on the surface. Press it against an ultra dry cardboard lid for the duration of shipping and of course you're going to get some oil spots. DON'T LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU. When I first put cash in the larger pocket, it was a little too tight for my comfort, so I started twisting, bending, rolling, and distressing the leather to stretch it out. After a few minutes of work, the leather stretched and the cash fits perfectly. The stitching is also a great indication of quality. It's thick and strong compared to other leather wallets that I've had in the past that have worn out and split within weeks of purchasing. No splitting with these threads. I recommend it and will probably purchase another.",Positive
Great for wedding Great product which will be perfect for my daughter’s wedding! Arrived quickly in perfect condition and was exactly as depicted in picture!,Positive

I messaged Auralee several times before placing the order and requested several customizations - she easily and precisely made every alteration exactly as I specified even down to an 1/8 inch! It fits my middle finger perfectly at size 8.5 and is very comfortable, being finished smoothly with no rough edges whatsoever.<br /><br />Auralee was VERY prompt, professional and personal in every detail of her communication and the transaction! She even included a sweet, handwritten message with the piece. Can’t say how impressed I am with this artist and how happy I am with this ring!!!<br /><br />Cheers and many thanks, Auralee!",Positive
"Great addition to our wall I can’t say enough about how well made this is. My husband and I were happily surprised at the quality. We chose navy blue and it is beautiful.

"APPLY EACH HEART SEPERETALY!!! Wanted to show people behind me I'm losing life. Super quick delivery, not bad price and installed easy enough!! My only issue (MY FAULT!!!) Is that all 3 pieces come on one sheet. As u can see it curves down cause I adhered it all at once and to keep from crinkles just kept going. CUT THEM SO CAN APPLY PIECE BY PIECE w rubbing alcohol and a CC! Cool thing is ordered another so will remove one or 2 but means I get more life!",Positive
"Authentic and Well Crafted As best I can tell, the necklace did indeed contain authentic Moldavite.  I've got a fairly good eye there, but am not a gemologist. :)  Fake Moldavite is common, so having a source you can trust is important.<br /><br />The wire 'cage' of the pendant is nicely made (artistic and sturdy) and holds the stones securely as well.<br /><br />The only SMALL knock I have is that the cord the pendant came with is so short it barely fits around my neck.",Positive

"The Perfect Wreath! Gorgeous, beautiful and perfectly made!  I fell in love with this wreath when I saw it on Amazon and was thrilled when I received it. This wreath will take your breath away. It is so pretty!  I can’t tell you how many compliments I received during the Christmas holidays. Most people stayed outside in the cold to talk about how elegant it looked on my front door. I kept telling them, come inside and let’s talk but they were too busy feeling, touching and looking at my wreath. My neighbors wanted to know where I got it from because it was certainly well made. The wreath came in a well constructed box that can be used as a storage box. This is and will be my lifetime wreath. It is too lovely not to be anything less!",Positive

"Fun, but a bit odd Kids loved playing it. If you look at the stuff that's going on on the board itself you'll probably laugh and question it at the same time. There's a character that's urinating on Stonehenge, another character that's watering a pot garden, another that's appears to be tripping on mushrooms, a group that's playing spin the bottle, etc. Sturdy built, but I'm just curious who designed this thing. Not suitable for children with the drug references.",Positive
Exactly what I expected Perfect size and the quality was good considering the price.,Positive
The color Love it.,Positive
"Love these earrings! Found these by accident when looking for level back earrings— sick of losing clasps and keepers— live the colors— I bought one pair in every color and they are great. Love the history, quality and they are the perfect size. I wish they had more shades to buy now.",Positive
"Coming back for more I’m about four months along in my loc journey with microlocs and I needed something besides just plain water to give my hair an uplift in the morning. Well this is it! The smell is great. Not overpowering at all. After it dries I can catch a light scent of the peppermint but that’s cool, I like it. Most importantly it wakes my hair up after being in a bonnet all night long and leaves me with soft moisturized locs and a fresh scalp. The bottle has lasted about a month with using it twice daily. Overall I say this is an awesome product if you want something that is natural, smells good and doesn’t leave residue or build up. Just added a new bottle to my cart today.",Positive

"Good quality These came super fast and are printed on thick paper, with a semi-gloss type coating to protect them. They fit perfectly in a normal 8x11 frame. The coloring is very nice and makes them look ""older"" but with clearly printed typing. I used them in a half bath that has black fixtures with black and gold granite counters. Great value!",Positive

"Easy and Effective! [[VIDEOID:91f34d3d27823ab495ef0a8c87105276]] I bought this product out of desperation and I could not have been more pleased with the outcome. Although I wash my hair routinely, I could not get the lint and product buildup out no matter how hard I tried. 3 years into my journey, I have never had a detox. This product comes with simple instructions and smells AMAZING. I had a severe situation, so I did two 30 min soaks to completely rid my hair of the issue. After one soak, it was nearly all-gone. The product left my hair soft. I will be purchasing extra bags for down the line!",Positive
"Perfection!!! I contacted the artist about getting a custom pendant for my daughter. She was very patient and diligent about making sure that I got the exact pendant that I wanted.<br /><br />When I received it, it was packaged very well. I got it MUCH earlier than expected.<br /><br />The pendant itself is actually two parts that are meant to be worn together “charm necklace” style. The size and weight were as described. They both have a nice weight and feel very substantial; I think they will last several lifetimes and hopefully will become a family heirloom to be passed down through many generations!<br /><br />The included chain was perfect for the pendants. And the patina on both the necklace and pendants are gorgeous!<br /><br />The flowers I chose were Forget-Me-Not and Dandelion seed in the oval pendant, and mustard seed in the round pendant. The color of the Forget-Me-Not was vibrant and paired very well with the Dandelion seed. The movement of the mustard seed inside the small round pendant was something that I didn’t think would matter much, but (luckily) I deferred to the artists knowledge of her materials and the movement of it just served to bring even more life to an already magnificent piece!<br /><br />Contina, thank you a million times over for the beautiful pendant arrangement!!! I know my daughter will love it!!! And I know your shop will be the first place I shop for all of my jewelry from now on!<br /><br />I will definitely be recommending you to all my friends!",Positive
Great item! Beautiful necklace mom loved it!,Positive

I’ll definitely be using this again for future parties!",Positive

A Bday gift This was a gift. She is currently wearing it. She wanted a stud that had a short post for her tragus piercing.  She feels it is the right fit length wise to still clean her ear out.,Positive

Must have poster! Great quality! It comes exactly like it’s described!,Positive
"Beautiful… but… Take note: It is only painted with white dots edging the wings on one side so there’s really only one best way to hang it and that is with the butterfly looking to the right. Also, there were NO hooks/clasps on either end of the black chain to hang it onto the suction cup hook or to hook the chain onto the butterfly. All my other sun catchers came with these hooks. I really like it and hope the sender can provide two small clasps so it hangs properly. How do I contact the sender?",Positive
Love this for the value!! It fits well in with our decor and it’s just want I wanted to fill a space. Very sturdy as well. I would recommend it.,Positive

"Delicate and Mystical! The color of these jade earrings is just mesmerizing... and very calming. The look of the earrings while on is very mystical and beautiful, to me. The description states you have to wear them continuously to get any health properties from them. But even if there are no health benefits, their beauty is enough. The gold earring backs provided are extremely small, so it's great the silicone pairs are also included. You will feel a little mystery about yourself when wearing these pretty jade studs. Simple and classy!",Positive
Beautiful!! Love  it!! ❤️ This is a gorgeous bracelet with smaller gemstones so it’s great if you’re a female and if you have smaller wrists.<br />it was also packaged beautifully!!,Positive
Love it Necklace is nice and well put together. No complaints so far on that. The free gift it comes with is a different story as it came with a crooked topping and covered in excess glue. All in all still 5 stars bc the necklace itself is great and the free gift is just that.,Positive
Beautiful and danty I got the smallest bracelet and fit her beautifully.  She is only 6 lbs 9 oz right now but can wear it for a couple more months I believe.  I couldn't see the name Everleigh very well on the bracelet because it's so tiny.,Positive

"The perfect bag with superb quality This is not a mass-produced item (it's made by a couple per their note with my bag) and the quality is incredible. I've wanted a messenger bag like this for years and I'm so happy with the purchase. I think the strap is a nice length, though I had to get it on the last loop because I'm a little on the tall side, but I like where the purse hangs.<br /><br />Thank you for shipping this so quickly--I was expecting it a week later than I received it.",Positive
Beautiful bugs! These are beautiful! I didn’t realize they didn’t come with frames but that was ok I did have to cut the sides to fit them into the frames I bought but it was just the white around the edges. They are just what I wanted and a great compliment to the room.,Positive
"Beautiful gift. I love the tree of life theme and abalone, these were perfect. Not too heavy. I have received multiple compliments. I would definitely but other pieces from them.",Positive
Very nice I love it! I have a small wrist almost like a child though my hand is much bigger. Lol I can get it on not worrying about it coming off. It is exactly as described. Elegantly made in my opinion!<br /><br />My wrist is 6 in in diameter and the biggest part of my hand is almost 9 inches and the bracelet is about 9 inches in diameter. I had a little hard time wrapping the measuring tape but I think it got it pretty close!<br /><br />Love my 🎻 bracelet! Thank you!,Positive
Cute So cute and good quality,Positive
Just as advertised and then some!!!! I love it!!!! I purchased frames from Walmart for $1.93 each and hung them with medium command strips!!!! They're a little uneven cause I was too excited to wait for my husband to hang them... but they are perfect in my eyes 🥰,Positive

Lego Dimensions Organizer display I absolutely love this display case! I love that it is compact and doesn't take up a lot room on my end table. My  only problem is that I ran out of room... too many mini figures :/ I need about 2 more rows I think. But for the price excellent. I love that its handmade. The craftsmanship is very clean and is customizable. I just got bare wood (because I am an artist and wish to paint it myself) but its quality and arrived pretty quick. :),Positive
Five Stars great,Positive

"They are very thin, but gave the look I ... They are very thin, but gave the look I wanted. I probably should have gone in a different color. This was the shimmer gold. Not really shimmery.",Positive
"Buy it! Easy to use. I attempted with a stencil brush vs roller and nothing bled through. Use minimal paint and it will come out amazing! I received 2 large stencils that cut my normal project time in half. In comparison to others I’ve used previously, the value is definitely there.",Positive

"Very well made I really love this Lei, however the year says 2022 and I searched up 2023 graduation leis..  Make sure you are paying attention to the year on your graduation gifts so they are the right ones.. Seems when you search the year you need, the previous year always populates first.  I was so excited ordering things for my daughter, I failed to make sure I paid attention to the grad year on the product.. I did send a message to the seller so I'm hoping I can at least get a replacement for the year and can add it myself but it was truly my mistake of not paying attention to details.. The lei itself is beautifully made and the colors are spot on!  I would recommend this purchase!<br /><br />UPDATE:  The seller was wonderful with communication and sent me the 2023 year with no additional charge even though it was my mistake!  Wonderful to work with!  I will order from this seller again in the future!!",Positive
Great. Great.,Positive

"Great product! The decal is perfect! Exactly as pictured! The high school graduate, who I purchased this for, is going to LOVE it. Thank you!",Positive
Purfect Literally the cutest thing ever,Positive
Small good for keychain. Good quality. Its small good for a keychain. 3d printed so I'm sure who ever made it had a good plan for it. No complaints. The keychain side is a good strong hold onto the 3d print. Loud but because of the size the pitch is high.<br />Needs a sanding or somekind of smoothing out.,Positive
Beautiful Bracelet! This bracelet was beautifully made and the quality of the stones is amazing! I am so in love!,Positive
"Excellent quality, craftsmanship, and Beautiful! Amazing print, expertly mounted and ready to hang.  Hanging hardware included!  Beautiful, vivid colors, life-like silhouettes.  Top quality in every way. Highly recommend.",Positive

"Worth every penny I am in love with my Oddish Planter, and it's impressive to those who see it. I picked this design because it had the eyes and face colored in, which takes it to the next level. Also supporting a small company is great too!",Positive
"Excellent quality, great results, super easy to use! I absolutely love this! I ordered it to make frogs and turtles out of polymer for fairy gardens. Shipping was extremely fast! This mold is so thick and sturdy! I just started playing with it this morning, and one thing I really loved was that since it’s clear, you can see if you have any hollow areas in your impressions before you end up taking them out, and then have to re-do them! I love the detail on the turtles and frogs too! I’m thinking that due to the bending back and forth (gravity is definitely your friend getting these little guys out! But it’s very easy!) I definitely won’t try doing all 4 at once again as it resulted in warping the 2 turtles. Nothing at all wrong with the design, but I am guessing just a learning experience. I still ended up getting beautiful frogs and turtles and at a fraction of the price. They’re so quick and easy to do! I would absolutely recommend this product and this seller! They even threw in an adorable acorn mold with my order.",Positive
"Perfect! Great quality! I've been looking for a sturdy, medium size leather bag for quite some time. This one is just what I was looking for. It's simple and good quality, The stitching, and lining look like they will hold up to a lot of wear and tear. Great product!",Positive

Game Time! I like the slightly rustic look.,Positive

"Great Catholic All Occasion Cards! These are beautiful, and from what I remember (I have sent most of them already!) they most (or all?) have prayers on the back.  The artwork is so detailed.  I can't remember the last time I was so excited to send cards to my friends!  The only thing I didn't like?  Sending them all out - I love them so much, I'm going to order a set for myself so that I can frame them and put them around the house!",Positive
Five Stars These are beautiful,Positive

Great pic! Good quality The photo was beautiful and was exactly what we needed for a party as decor. Would buy again.,Positive
"Genuine crystals that are Reiki infused! Very fast delivery, received item within 5 days of placing the order and that included the holidays! I absolutely love these bracelets that Stephanie makes by hand and infuses with Reiki. Better quality than other sites. I have just started to learn about crystals, so I like knowing that I am buying real gemstones, not plastic or imitation, while at the same time supporting a small business owner here in the US. I also appreciate the descriptions she includes with each bracelet. I have purchased 2 bracelets so far and plan on buying many more!",Positive

Cutest fluffy pup! These earrings came up when I searched “Keeshond jewelry” and I’m so glad they did. I ordered them for my mom for Christmas. They arrived in gift-ready packaging and are so cute I had to order the necklace for myself.,Positive
"A treat for an old farmhouse... I love these Mason jar sconces.  I reviewed picture scale, height and position above couches for weeks before deciding on these.  In old farmhouses, it’s difficult to make modern furniture and technology work, so planning is essential!  The sconce wood frames are lightweight and arrive ready to hang.  The hardware is sturdy (back hangers and wrought iron hooks).  I purchased the fairy lights separately on Amazon, and found buying four light strings with a remote the most convenient way to go for this look.  I added flowers, vase filler  and lights to the jars.  Like other reviewers, the battery pack on the lights I purchased did not fit inside the jar mouth, so I secured with twist ties and placed the battery packs on the jar tops.  Flowers cover the battery packs.  The sconces arrived earlier than expected and very well packed...I even received a notification from Amazon and the seller to ensure their arrival.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Thank you!",Positive
Fabulous These shoe clips are beautiful!!!,Positive
A great gift! Honestly was worth the money and wait<br />Dainty and a nice staple to wardrobe!,Positive
Nice engraving. The ring is very nice. I just got it. I will see if it scratches.<br />It seems a bit smaller then I thought it would be.,Positive
Five Stars every thing about this press is great,Positive
Love these Before I found these at Amazon I would go to the state fair to purchase this kind of  dish cloth from a nice lady in a booth that I had to hunt for... Amazon makes it a lot easier. Better than a stinky old sponge and it washes up great.,Positive

"Super satisfied with my purchase! I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase! I loved the fact that the customized name was created and shipped immediately. I received it sooner than I had expected which is nice. I am giving the seller 5 stars and a thumbs up for replying so fast to my special request on the side of my customization already! The name was painted white and it goes perfect in our soon to be newborns room. The only thing is that it doesn't come with anything to be hung, but it wasn't a major issue we were able to purchase double sided heavy duty tape for 10lbs so it should hold up since we didn't want to nail the pretty thing.",Positive

Excellent Customer Service! Installing it was easy but don’t rush.  I screwed up on the last “S” in “EXCUSES” and took a chance that the manufacturer/seller would comp a replacement letter AND they did!  Received two in fact by regular mail within 3 days!  I really like the silver finish against the blackboard.  It’s wonderful!!<br /><br />2/23 Update:  NOW it’s finished!  It’s just exactly as I imagined my new workout wall should be!,Positive

"Nice artwork The prints themselves are great. They came with cardboard in the package to prevent folding and each was in its own plastic wrapper. I mistakingly thought this set had the narwhal in it, so it was a disappointment when it didn’t (but that’s on me). My only issue was how slow shipping was. When ordering it says takes 1-3 days to make, ok that’s fine, but I think the default shipping (free shipping) must be the slowest shipping method there is.",Positive

"The Perfect Pair of Earrings for Me I'm allergic to nickel and gold and am really self conscious of my asymmetrical earlobes.  One is attached and the other is slightly detached.  When I got my ears pierced as a young teenager, the piercer leveled the holes to each other but didn't center them on my ears.  So ever since, I've always felt that studs just emphasize that and make me look lopsided.  Not these though!  I had never heard of mismatched earrings before, but these are amazing!  They're really well made and look fantastic!  I also have very small ears, so they are a little bit larger than I had expected.  However, they still fit my ears well!  The leaves are also just super cute!  The posts and backs are made from stainless steel (no nickel!) so I have not had any allergic reactions while wearing them.",Positive
"Fantastic face mask! Excellent coverage for face and beard! Surgical mask fits inside! At last, I found my face mask! I'm 6'3"" and have a beard. And a head proportional to my body size.<br />I've bought a half-dozen different kinds of masks, and have always been disappointed by how small they were in spite of claims. All of my other masks went from my nose bridge to just under my chin and barely stayed in place (they would creep up).<br />This mask is simply perfect for me. It covers me from my nose bridge to just above my Adam's apple including my (trim) beard. It is meant for big heads: this is the first time I had to tighten the ear loops (vs. tossing the rubber rings), so I might be on small-average size for this mask size. One feature I haven't tried yet is inserting a disposable surgical mask to use as a filter (instead of the typical, small disposable mask filters.) I saw several other XL/XXL masks but they didn't have both a metal nose piece (required to fit under glasses and not fog them up) AND the ability to insert a filter. This mask has both. It's also softer than my other fabric masks, FYI. After receiving the mask, trying it on and liking it, I ordered 5 more (one per car and per house door). This may be Day-1 infatuation, but from someone who's been on lock-down for 7 months, I kinda know my way around face masks. Highly recommended!",Positive
"Great toy! This is a very good, calming toy! It is in a glass bottle, so beware of that, but our whole family has enjoyed this!",Positive
Amazing little piece! I ordered the spin ring just a few days ago. I've always been a bit reluctant to order anything that is not *Prime as I've had a bad experience in the past. But Steel Lynx has great reviews already and the price was more than affordable.<br />my Spin ring arrived well ahead of the estimated time frame.<br />The colors I chose are vibrant and exciting and even better in person. I'm so happy with my chosen custom colorization.<br />The spin ring is not really meant to be worn as a constant wear ring as the multi ring bands makes the ring a bit bulky on my finger and that's totally ok. Just when my hands a bored and something to fidget with.<br />I absolutely LOVE this and I will definitely Order from Steel Lynx again! And soon!,Positive
Wife love it Wife loved it,Positive

"Quality Leather Check Holder This is a great checkbook holder that adds style to any home office.

This time I asked for a small bauble to be included, and it added a personal touch - thank you so much!!!",Positive
"Not an actual bumper sticker Turns out this is a small replica of a larger number sticker.  this one is much smaller and more compact, like a baby bumper sticker.  Rubber baby buggy bumpers...  Good sticker that says UpState, if you put it on something be prepared to answer the question every few minutes.. upstate where?  But other than that it is a fantastic product, would definitely recommend.",Positive

"Seller resolved problem promptly ***Update from 1 Star to 4 Stars***<br />I contacted the seller about the problem as the name was not in script as I had ordered and engraving was faint.  They responded very quickly and offered a replacement.  The replacement also arrived promptly in a gift pouch (I already have the gift box) and it is much improved (see for yourself).  I am glad that I reached out to them and I am grateful for them standing by their product and service to correct errors and satisfy customers.  Updating the review facts is the very least I can do.  I appreciate this company and I’d buy from again.  I hope any other unsatisfied customers reached out to them.  Even if you’ve given the gift, wouldn’t it be better to give them a chance to correct it?<br /><br />———————<br /><br />(Original Review before update:I’m so disappointed.  I ordered script and they stamped/engraved it as separate letters, which with a short name looks horrible!  The engraving is so shallow and small you can barely see it.  This is NOT what is represented in their samples and other pictures.  I read one review about this issue but it was buried in so many glowing reviews I discounted it.  I should have gone with my gut.  Returning if they let me.)",Positive
"Great product! Buying more for gifts... Great product, you can tell at first glance is made with quality! I'm getting a couple more for gifts! Wooden comb and sturdy bottle opener, light weight and pocket size. Just great for the price!!!",Positive

"Looks great! The product looks great, and the finishing is top notch. Arrived as per the promised delivery date, thought we ordered during the Thanksgiving holidays. The only thing that could be improved is the customer service - prior to placing the order, I wanted to confirm what sizing would be best. But the customer care never reverted, so I went with my gut. Would have appreciated a response!<br /><br />For reference purposes, the size we chose for a 9 character name was 24 inches. The font we chose was Cookie.",Positive
Durable Nametags These turned out just as they were advertised! Cute and simple. Hard plastic that's very durable. I mainly bought these to help my nursery workers at church  identify my boys' diaper bag without having to put a sticky label on the bag every week.<br />I bought my oldest boy one for his pre-school backpack too but I typically don't like to have his name broadcasted on his bag unless I'm around. It's nice that these can easily be removed if needed.,Positive
Beautiful These are well made and very pretty.,Positive
Cute earrings Very cute! Got many compliments on them!😍,Positive
"Great product I love the pendant. It's accurate and well-made. It has a good weight and the chain has a good length too. The pendant is a little smaller than I thought, but I don't have any complaints. It's a great gift for anyone who loves ATLA and I'm very happy with my purchase.",Positive

Vanity mirrors I am I love with my new mirrors.,Positive
Purchase Love it but it didn’t come in the size I expected,Positive
Look great I like the style and I get a lot of compliments on them. Would buy similar earrings.,Positive
"An epic masterpiece. Just buy it. Y’all. I obviously didn’t read the description, because now I see that it clearly states that this is hand painted and not a vinyl decal, so I was INCREDIBLY impressed when I realized the artistry that went into this. It is GLORIOUS. My brother passed away unexpectedly two weeks ago, and Jeff Goldblum was our “thing”. Oh, the inside jokes and memes we sent back and forth! This wine glass makes me incredibly happy and I will think of him every time I use it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. If you are on the fence about whether or not you need this epic Goldblum glass, let me tell you right meow... YES. YOU NEED IT. Just add it to your cart now. You won’t be disappointed.",Positive
Great way to keep our loved ones memory alive Great way to keep my mom's memory alive this past year was the first Christmas without her. It also comes with this little paper heart I believe that you can plant we haven't got the chance to plant it. Very sentimental,Positive

"Nice I am pleased with the purse,  letting it air out now since I just opened it from packing,  My Ipad fits easily and that was what I wanted,  Only thing that isn’t what I expected, my iPhone won’t fit in the exterior pockets or side pockets so I will have to put it inside, but I can live with that,,,,<br />Very nice purse and I recommend getting it …..thank you for the note inside too, good touch,,,,,donna",Positive
"Fast delivery Got here in great timing! I will state that upon picture, the flash won't be the same as all Labradorite is different. I did wish mine had more flash, but in the right light you can see the pretty deep blue flash. Make sure to read the size of the necklace before ordering. ☺️",Positive

"Perfect country touch for your tree She looks precious on our tree. I wanted a big bow and my husband grew up with angel on the tree, so we compromised. Our tree is really big and full, and my walls are white. If I had it to do again, I’d have ordered a red one so she would show up better, but still love her!",Positive
"This product is beautiful and well worth the price. I fell in love with the well as its craftmanship and I purchased it. No hesitation.  It was beautiful and looked fragile, but holds up to rugged shipping containers.  I have not seen this product in the US, so that makes it unique and a great conversation piece. I am well pleased with this wishing well.",Positive
High quality Such good quality! Wanting to buy another one!,Positive

"Great decal Fantastic product, works like a charm, and looks great.",Positive

Necklace isperfect It was exactly as described and portrayed.<br />Thank you.,Positive
"High quality item This is a beautifully crafted hatchet loop made of sturdy, attractively tanned leather with four metal fasteners (fastens the tool loop to the belt loop). Man, the price was excellent and to think buying this supports a small business craftsman right here in the ol' USA. Cannot recommend highly enough.",Positive
Perfect! Easy to install and looks great!  Exactly what needed to display my street number.,Positive

"Love having my nose ""pierced"" again I've had my nose pierced before and had a hoop in it for about a year when I took it out for about a week and it grew back. I went to get another piercing later and I had a horrible time with a bump and infection so I basically gave up. I thought this may be a good idea because I don't have to actually get a piercing. It turned out great! I love that there are two colors for a good price. I also like the size. It's almost too small for my nose but it fits well. I'm a little worried it will fall out, but what else would you expect with a fake piercing? Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase!",Positive
"Five Stars Just what I needed for summer, well made!",Positive
"Beautiful and useful Exactly as pictured and described.  Very beautiful, colors are vibrant, and it's nice and thick.  It's great to have in my kitchen to set hot items on, or use as a coaster for large cups of soup.  I bought 2 of different designs and plan on getting a couple more.",Positive
Great gift I really love how these are customizable! It’s a little weird that it’s just a sticker but that’s totally cool because it still made a great gift.,Positive
Perfect for my son's room. This print is perfect for my son's room. I put it in a black frame and it looks amazing!,Positive
Makes people laugh Love these big hit in my bathroom,Positive
"Super cute, great quality - can’t believe it was so affordable It came super quick, the seller was easy to get on contact with, and the tag is perfect! I did think I chose a different color but my fat thumbs must have betrayed me. Happy with the ‘rose’ colored one we received!",Positive

"A Miracle! 1818 Farms Shea Creme is amazing!  Although the jar is feather-light, the creme is the only creme that made the skin on my feet soft & supple.  Having used many other products of all price ranges, this is the one  not only effective but above and beyond!",Positive
"Motivational!! I bought this Motivational Poster to put on the wall in my gym. I read it every day before I start working out, it pumps me up to give it my all and to workout harder. The Quality and Price are Excellent.",Positive
"This Holders HOLDS My Fitbit, and More Accurately Counts My Steps, AND I Won't Lose It... I'm using this product to hold my fitbit, because the bands break over time after popping the fitbit in/out. This made to order band is PERFECT. Once you get the fitbit INSIDE BOTH ENDs (think of the old original sandwich bags fold and flip over securement), the fitbit stays inside and can't come out until you work (and I mean you got to work) the little INSIDE securement UNDER the fitbit so it will pop out. It's safe, soft, and easy to put on my ankle, and wear under my socks OR right on tip of low-cut socks without interfering with walking, activity OR sleeping. I'd recommend this to anyone AND HOPE the Seller offers other colors (I'd buy MORE).",Positive
Cute Adorable thanks !,Positive

Excellent Design & Craftsmanship I feel honored to have this piece in the entryway of our home. Beautiful. Thank you.,Positive
"Definitely go with the bigger size The craftsmanship of this clock is stunning. I have seen similar clocks online, but I love the design and quality of this one the most. I bought the 16"" clock because I thought 11"" would be too small, and honestly part of me wishes I had gone for the 18"", but 16"" is fine for my needs. Can easily be seen and read from a distance.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings then I highly recommend getting this clock.<br /><br />My only complain is that the clock arms could be nicer quality. The second hand arrived a little bent, but it was easy to bend back into place. They are functional, but with how nice the rest of the clock looks they look a little plain.",Positive
"Superb product, fast and accurate service Excellent value for good quality, good price, and absolutely top notch service.  The price was quite competitive compared to any other personalized travel map I could find. Tom got on the order the day I placed it, confirmed the size (48""x30"") and personalization that I desired, and sent it on its way. The maps was well-protected for shipping, and it was at our door the next day!  Everything was exactly as ordered, including the color of the pins, which have 1/4"" heads-a larger size that is much classier and easier to handle.  (The blue pins show up better in the first picture--there are 4 times as many in silver, which stand out much better in reality.)  Quality is fine, no defects, no issues. All measurements perfect: ready for hanging and placing your pins. Now I'm thinking about framing it--once you see it on the wall, it's absolutely frameworthy.",Positive
Refreshing! I truly like this Lilac room spray.  It handles odors quickly and leaves a very pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming like some air fresheners can be.  I would highly recommend this product!! AN,Positive

"Nice thinking of us gift Wife just loved it ,mad her cry with happy tears",Positive
"14K Gold part is great, but Lapis Lazuli part should be twice bigger 14K Gold part is great. But, Lapis Lazuli is much smaller than expected. In my opinion, its size is the size of penny or dime. The size should be the size of quarter. Lapis Lazuli is one of relatively cheap gemstones. So, I don’t understand the reason why it is so small.  Its color should be brighter, too.",Positive
Looks like a cat has taken a nose dive into my tree I love the craftsmanship. Very well made with top notch yarn and solid. Very fun to have on my tree!,Positive
"nice ring I ordered two, the gold one and the silver one, i really love them, finally o found a razonable price for a gold ring!!!!",Positive

Seller takes pride in her product These are exactly what I wanted and they were packaged beautifully. The little touch of including a storage bag for in between times is absolutely perfect and unexpected.,Positive
"Awesome product. Will buy again. I love love love the design! I specifically purchased this one because it has a butterfly look to it without being childish. It is sturdy, yet lightweight, and it was packaged very well. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because part of the metal was not as smooth as the rest of the item, so the black paint did not coat as well making it look rough in that spot, and there were some scratched spots on the back. Also, even though it was packaged extremely well, it was still a tad bit warped when it arrived, making it difficult to lay flat against the wall. Regardless of those minor issues, I would definitely purchase again! And just might! Awesome product!",Positive
Love! Super cute! My every day go to necklace now!,Positive

"Just powerful I didn't get these as fast as I wanted, but they were well worth the wait!  I am refashioning a few boleros, lining them with lace and adding these along with black pearls. I am very proud to have them.  I love cameos... now I love brownskinthings cameos. They are made with great care it seems.  Clean and formed well with so much detail. I hope in the future more designs will be made... maybe even custom ones? I will treasure them and i would recommend that if your thinking on buying , you should right away!!!",Positive
"Just like the perfume!! I currently have the actual Jo Malone velvet rose and oud & I can 100% without a doubt say that it smells exactly the same!!! The only downside is that it doesn’t radiate and last as long as the actual perfume, although I admit that is to be expected! I would definitely recommend this if you’re looking for the same scent in an affordable travel size to take everywhere with you!",Positive

"I absolutely love this ring I absolutely love this ring! The quality is wonderful and I love how unique it is. It should be noted that the rock can vary from the picture because of it being a &#34;raw&#34; gem stone, but that's what makes it so unique! The only thing I would warn is that the sizing seems to be slightly off (at least compared to U.S. sizing). I ordered a 7.75 in hopes to wear the ring on my ring finger, however, it seems to fit more like a size 8, so I am wearing it on my middle finger. Either way, I love the ring and I would highly suggest ordering it! It truly is beautiful.",Positive
my Granddaughter love it. Perfection.... my Granddaughter love it....,Positive
Great Case!! I love this case. I constantly get comments on it as well. The leather is soft and breaks in really well. I have had it four months now and it feels great. I carry five cards and a few business cards at all times and they are snug but they fit.  My only con is that sometimes for some reason people have a hard time hearing me on my phone. It only happens a few times in a week. But the phone easily pops out of the case so they can hear me. We are still trying to figure out what is going on. It might not be the case but rather my phone.,Positive
Wicked f'n COOL! This makes me soooooooo darn HAPPY!  Bwa ha ha ha!,Positive
This was great. The quality is really good and it really ... This was great.  The quality is really good and it really made a difference in the birthday's decoration.,Positive

It will even fit larger sized wrists, unlike all the others I have purchased in the past.  The strap is wel made and looks very sharp.  Highly recommended.",Positive
So beautiful I'm so happy with my purchase. It took a while to come due to a little mess up with my post office but the sellers contacted me immediately when the shipping time ran out and sent me a new one along with the a little extra gift to it. It was for my mother's birthday and mother's day that fell on the same day for her dreads and she loves it. This item deserves the hype,Positive
Love it I gave it a four stars because it took a little while for me to rub the letters on the glass and every time I try to peel it it wasn’t sticking so I had to really really take my time but other than that it looks great I love it,Positive
Good quality Presentation and quality of item is appreciated,Positive
"LOVE IT I hung this on my door. I can't read it without reading it in Galdalf/Frodo's voice. Love it. The only thing I will say that I was on the fence about, is it IS a bit expensive in my opinion. It's good quality, don't get me wrong... but just seemed a bit expensive.",Positive
Stunning Piece I got this necklace for my mom for mothers day and she loves it! I was surprised about the size. The silver ring is about the same circumference as a quarter. But none the less a stunning piece! It also came in a very cute blue box.,Positive

"Breathtaking work Ms Alisha did an AMAZING job of creating a beautiful rose for my wedding. I purchased it for my bride-to-be, because she is a huge fan of &#34;Beauty & the Beast&#34;... the amount of time and energy she put into making the rose is only eclipsed by her willingness to customize her creation to give it a special, almost intimate touch. Her idea of customer service is out of this world, because she wanted to make absolutely sure I was happy with EVERY aspect of her creation...<br />Her attention to detail is second to none, and I will tell you right now, if you're looking for a special, one-of-a-kind gift for that special someone, look no further. Alisha can do it... she has been in contact with me since I first ordered, wanting to make sure EVERY DETAIL is perfect.<br />For the amount of time she puts into her work, the price is a BARGAIN. Alisha's talent is abundantly clear when you see her finished work. Give her a try... you will NOT be disappointed.<br />And now, to Alisha... I can't thank you enough for the time and care you placed in the crafting of this gift. I wish nothing but the best for you in your business!",Positive

"Very Personal service by DreamTree Prints I greatly appreciate the customization options that allowed me to order two similar yet unique gifts for my two sons and their spouses to commemorate each of their weddings.  The folks at DreamTree Prints did a very nice job of processing my order with the information I provided.  The prints arrived faster than I anticipated and were packaged with such care that they both arrived in perfect condition.  Now if I can only hold up my end with  the shadowbox frames I'm building to display the prints, along with special mementos from the kids' weddings, then I think their gifts will be a hit.  I won't hesitate to order from DreamTree Prints again!  Thank you  for the personal touches, including the handwritten note that you included with the order.",Positive

Gifted to my nursing student I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it!  She uses it to carry all her stuff with her to work.  It is a tad smaller than I expected- but to be honest I didn't look at the measurements.  BUT- that's ok- because she loves it!  Sewn in customization is gorgeous and makes the tote one of a kind!,Positive
"Happy with purchase! Loved this product. It took two weeks to arrive probably because of the shipping delays. The dog tags are made of good quality. Easy to read, cute font and design. The seller even packaged it up nicely and left a little note!",Positive

"What I hoped for ❤️‍🔥 It was a beautiful hanger and exactly what I was looking for, and I had to fly it 4.5 hours where we got married, so I wrapped a little carbonara over the name and crossed my fingers and it was not effected by the plane ride so I was happy to see it traveled well, my only suggestion would be that it could have had the date displayed under the hook of the hanger and or the place/venue  instead of the fake flower decoration… still did what I wanted it to for my big day!",Positive

Fruit Loop wax melts Worked great for making the wax fruit loops in my fruit loops scented candle.  I would have given 5 stars if price was lower.  I thought it to be a bit over priced for the size.  I would have bought more because as you can see I needed to make about 6 different colors and that was time consuming.  In my opinion this should sell for about $5-$6 each or offer more quantities per order (3-4).,Positive
"Great for a bourbon lover! I gave this to my son for his 44th birthday--he is a collector of rare bourbons, and he loved adding the barrel stave to his ""bourbon bar.""",Positive
Artistic craftsmanship is awesome This is my third or fourth buckle from Klamra. Each buckle has artwork on both sides. And the back is as awesome as the front. That attention to detail is extremely rare and an added value. The fact that mine are solid brass and made in Ukraine is also a big plus for me. But they also have styles is German silver and silver if you want to upscale.,Positive

"Strong, sturdy, stylish. I ordered and received the 40” table legs within a few days. I installed them on a table top I salvaged from next to a dumpster and look forward to improving the project with paint when the weather gets nicer. After a full work day with some leaning, the welds are good and the steel is strong. The legs are sturdy enough to hold a medium-heavy table top with Macbook Air, two monitors, and multiple textbooks without wobbling. They look great for a stand-up table. Much nicer than fat, clunky wooden table legs.",Positive

"Absolutely beautiful artwork I bought a house recently and have slowly adorned my walls with meaningful art. I was delighted to discover Jason Smith's art on Amazon. Beautifully done, in colors and subjects that remind me of my years living in the Southwest.<br />Jason's prints are professional looking and well presented. The colors are lovely. I bought several different prints. Some have a whimsical, playful vibe while others have a deeper spiritual or mystical feel. I look forward to seeing more of Jason's work. The prints arrived well packaged and in a timely manner, often sooner than expected.",Positive

Great picture just wish it was quite larger So glad I found this! My boyfriends birthday is coming up and we are huge Disney fans and we are going to be moving in together next month and I thought a way to commemorate our trip to Disney in October 2019 would be to have a picture of his favorite ride in our new house together.

EZGO Roof Cover Nice product for the price. Easy to install. Hope it holds up well over time.,Positive
"As promised! Everything was great about this. It arrived 4 days or so after I ordered it. I must say cost of shipping was a little too much for an amazon prime member and wish there was no shipping at all but I understand. The only feedback can give to the maker is to all a set of screw selection just like the different size selection. This was sent with a set of two different screws. The long ones were perfect for the wall installation but the shorter ones were still too long for me and it would come out of our wooden shelf if I would have used. So after spending another 6$ for a whole box of screws at Lowe’s, keep in mind I only needed 4, my total came up to 25$ for the brackets and my purchased screws. This doesn’t break the bank for one shelf but quickly can get up there in price if you had to install few shelves, not even thinking about the cost of the shelf itself.",Positive

"Exactly as described and stays sturdy on my key set. I carry a set of keys around work and I like to be equipped with the necessary crystals to keep my mind and soul at ease. There's a lot of negativity at work so I decided I really needed tourmaline to keep it at bay. A week later my ""enemy"" makes peace with me after trying to make my life hell for months. I still keep my eye on her, but it's a lot more relaxed in a way. Lol I'm a firm believer in crystal energy work so I will buy into them any day.",Positive

"Great Item for fans. Item is a print, but it is a print of one of the greatest films of the greatest love stories of all time. It arrived well packed in a cylindrical tube and wrapped. I put it in an appropriate sized frame and hung it in my hallway. My family and I have spent an inconceivable amount of time finding our favorite quotes from the film in it. And still I find more. If you have your favorite cult film or series, and this artist has word art for it, buy it, it is good work, sleep well, I will most likely buy more in the morning.<br /><br />I have more on the way. This is my idea of fine art.",Positive

The chain is thick and sturdy but very nice. I love that the designer sent a personalized letter with &#34;how to's&#34; to keep the jewelry in the best of shape. It came on time as expected.

I would definitely recommend any of her jewelry to orhers and will be back to buy again in the future.<br /><br />Picture not included because it looks the same as the pics from seller.",Positive
"Truly an awesome EDC caddy. Immediately when I received this product I loaded it up with my Leatherman Signal and my Karas Kustoms EDK pen and boy I love the form fit. The pen was a little challenging to insert into the holder but once I got it worked in its no problem now getting it in and out. What surprised me is that my Leatherman Signal multitool went in with no big issue and believe it or not, the multitool goes in/out easier than the pen. As you can see in the photos its a really handsome setup.  This RUNT will patina well over time due to I use both my multitool and pen on a daily basis and handling the leather will help get it to that rustic look.  I order a bronze bead on a black lanyard for this setup and can't wait to see how it will add to the chracter of the RUNT.",Positive

"quality personalized gift on short notice I was so surprised to see this personalized product ship out the next day! The price point was perfect, I was skeptical that it would turn out in such good quality given the low price but it far exceeded my expectations. The inscription was  as described with no errors, and the engraving was deep and accurate enough to be legible from further away. The chain and vertical bar were of good quality, no chips or flaws in the metal were observed, even where the engraving was done. Now for the timing, the necklace was a gift for mothers day, although I planned further ahead than usual it was still only 6 business days prior. I came across this product and thought it was perfect but usually personalized jewelry takes several weeks so I was very pleased with the turn around time, but did not expect it as fast as it did. Gave me enough time to package nicely and send to its final destination. you can customize the length, type of material and of course the inscription to fit anyone's taste. This will definitely be a seller I will recommend and return to for future purchases.",Positive

"Cute I love these. And would have given them 5 stars but there were no instruction for putting them on. I posted the question and got an answer saying you peal them off and  put them on one at a time. I am sure that that can't be right. And it turns out as I had thought, you warm them up with your hands and then they all come off on the sticky back together for easy placement. Then you just remove the film.",Positive

I hoped that the opal bead would look half as good in person as in the picture.  When I opened the box I was amazed that it surpassed my expectations.  It is lovely and the simplicity of it sliding on the beautiful necklace is wonderful.  I believe this one may become my favorite necklace.  I would recommend this to everyone with one caution.  I live in Wisconsin, Wisconsin winters are not favorable to opals.  Always handle it carefully and keep it from the cold if you live where Winter shows it's icy head!",Positive

Adorable Super cute gift. A cute little keychain and was made and shipped out very quickly. I love it,Positive
It works and it's cool I put this on my car a few weeks ago. No problems so far.,Positive
glass flowers I love these glass flowers.  Very pretty.  Took about 2 weeks to get but worth the wait.  I got 3 different ones and love all of them.,Positive

Great product for a great price Love this bag. Has withstood a wrestling season with three boys. Fits all their gear fairly well and the personalization looks as good as the day it arrived. We love it,Positive
"Although the butterfly is appealing the size is misleading.  Much smaller than anticipated. My wife does wear it daily, but it could be twice the size.  The picture is misleading.  Color is attractive though.",Positive
would recommend A little difficult for my grandson to comprehend was a little bit foggy on the ink other than that great product.,Positive
Love this scent The grape soda scent smells exactly like grape soda! The scent lasted about 2-3 full days. Will buy this one again. Shipping is very slow and takes a long time to get.,Positive
Five Stars Absolutely stunning,Positive

"Harley prints The pictures looked good online, which made me want to buy them for my son, who is a Harley enthusiast.  When the prints arrived, they  looked even better than online, and once I framed them, I knew he would love them, which he did!  Great job!",Positive
Good This item was very nice and I enjoyed reading it,Positive

Shes a Van fan She loved it,Positive
Very cute and well crafted. They are lightweight and well made.  The base appears to be wood?  With resign?  The design is well made and color is done well.  The backs are good quality.,Positive
Love the ring Had a little issue with the original ring. It was replaced with a great ring. Very happy.,Positive
Beautiful! The cup came out perfectly and arrived early as well. Can’t wait to give it as a Mother’s Day gift 🥰🥰🥰,Positive
Five Stars Excelente,Positive
Very happy!! These are very dainty and the perfect diameter for me. Very well made.<br />All the people having problems with the shape warping are not opening them right.<br />You don't pull the ends straight apart. Set it on a table and use needle-nose pliers to pull one side up towards you while holding the other side flat on the table.<br />Then use 2 pairs of pliers to push the sides back into place once it's inserted.,Positive
😍 Love it so much!,Positive
Awesome Awesome product love it,Positive
Beautiful Item!!! Very good quality pendant! I've seen many pendants that symbolize weigh lifting. Most of those are cheap looking. This one is perfect! I'm very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing from you again! Thanks!!!!,Positive
"Loved these! These are perfect for the wall I wanted to decorate in my bathroom. They are very affordable and I just bought cheap $2 frames and popped them in. It turned out way cute! I know you could probably print these yourself, but I did not have that font (and I love it) and they used super good quality card stock. So for me it was easier and cheaper just to order from Amazon.",Positive
Excellent product! So adorable! Great quality item.,Positive
"Awesome necklace Just what I wanted! As people said, shipping can be slow compared to prime, but actually got it way earlier than the estimated range, so that's a win. Thanks!",Positive
Looks just like the picture! Bought this for my 17 yr old grandson and he loves it.  Carries it with him everywhere.  Shows it off to everyone he knows.,Positive
love it it’s the perfect size,Positive
Very nice I bought this for my youngest son for Christmas. The saying is exactly what I would want him to know but something I could never put into words myself. I bought a nice black wooden frame for it and it came out looking beautiful! I'm sure it's a gift he will always treasure from me.,Positive
Put Some Time on it... My husband's favorite quote. Absolutely love it. Thank you for the added hearts it was a nice touch.,Positive
"It has been a wonderful purchase, and I hope I get to enjoy it for many years to come. Although Mr Lentz just recently started selling items on Amazon, I've had my wallet for 7 months now, and absolutely love it.<br /><br />The &#34;western brown&#34; leather is developing a wonderfully rich and dark patina. My only wish is that I could have had the option to order it with brass rivets instead of (what I presume to be) stainless steel or nickel that they come with.  The inside of the wallet still has a mostly original color to when I received the wallet, and you can see the outside cover has gotten significantly darker.<br /><br />If you're like me, I tend to only replace my wallet after many, many years of use. The stitching starts to blow out or it develops a wear-hole. I wanted to buy a wallet that didn't have stitching so it couldn't fray, and with a much higher grade of leather that wouldn't wear out as quickly (if at all). Note to the uninformed, &#34;Genuine Leather&#34; is a grade of leather that is second to the bottom in terms of quality. This is made from a single piece of full grain leather and is, in my humble opinion, a very high quality item that I expect will last a very long time.",Positive
Five Stars Awdome,Positive
Perfect! I was looking for an appropriate ornament for to mark the first Christmas home for my little guy (adopted internationally). It arrived quickly and I love it!

I will recommend this to any of my friends that are looking for an exceptional gift!!",Positive
"Great quality Bracelet! This bracelet is excellently made!  I actually just replaced my first one after wearing it for 3 years.  I do a lot of outdoor activities and it help up really well.  The black does fade over time, which is to be expected with cotton, especially considering going into pools and hanging out in the sun.<br />All I can say is it surpassed my expectations exceptionally!  Will definitely be buying another one in 3 more years 😁👍",Positive
Beautiful patches High quality patches. Beautiful designs and worksmanship.,Positive

"Love this anklet! It's summer, so I wanted to find an anklet that's cute but doesn't break the bank.  I love the one I got and have had it a few months and have never taken it off.  It is very durable and well made.  I will definitely be back for more.  The only con of it (that idk if the anklet industry has an answer for) is the excess strings that are left after  you tighten it.  I would prefer one that you tie and doesn't have the option to loosen, but it is nice to have the option to take if off if you want.",Positive

"Great gift for someone...Or yourself... Bought this as a xmas gift for my sister, then one for myself! I love how dainty the chain and charm are but that the compass still has a kinetic factor (the dial spins from the center axis). Very delicate, sturdy, but fun to play with. Also came with a small swatch of polishing cloth so you can remove the oxidation for more of a gleam or leave it to enhance the details.",Positive
Beautiful and well-made We love them.  They have a lovely pattern and the three sizes give options for just about anything we throw in the microwave.  Also really good for a cold bowl of ice cream!,Positive
Very pretty and good quality. My chain.,Positive
"Adorable, Great Value. These twist earrings are adorable. They look great, are comfortable to sleep in, and I haven't had any  reactions to the metal. The earrings were packaged with great care, and came with a lovely box, and instructions. I'll be visiting this seller's shop again.",Positive

Highly recommend!,Positive

"Five Months Update (Purchased Sept 2019. Today is Jan 2020) I thoroughly recommend this necklace to anyone looking for a chain they can shower with, sweat in and enjoy. I was desperate to find a necklace I didn't have to take on and off everyday, but I didn't want to pay for an expensive gold chain. This item seemed a little too good to be true at first, but I took stock of the amazing reviews and took a chance.<br /><br />I made the right move.<br /><br />I love, love, loooove this necklace. The only 'downside' is that the letter etched into the metal is a little faint for my tastes, but that's not a big deal breaker. For the price, this necklace is a great buy!",Positive
Five Stars Love it!,Positive
Great quality and value for the price! I don’t know why there are bad reviews but these peeled perfectly and were very cute! Great quality and value for the price.,Positive

"Pretty and versatile I love these firefly lights!!! 😍<br />It arrived inside a small box, neatly organized, and I turned it on and tested it. The lights have mutiple functions depending on how you want to use it (whether flickering like a fairy in a jar, fading in and out around the corners of the room for a more romantic feel, plus more) and very easy to setup. Mine even came with batteries so I could use them right away!!! I've had so many uses for this since I got it, very delicate but pretty lights even in the background it served for great sparkles to my photos.",Positive
"Expensive, but made my son happy I won't lie....it's overpriced for what it is. Realistically, the only reason it's priced so high is simply because they can.<br /><br />With that out of the way, it's a nice little addition to our son's elf family. First we had one elf. He kept asking if his elf would ever get married, so the next year the girlfriend made an appearance, followed by a wedding. Then our son kept telling us he was excited because now that they're married, they'll have a baby. So of course I had to go looking for a baby elf. There are other baby elves available, but they're more like toddlers, and when a well-meaning relative sent us a couple of them, they showed up with their heads permanently dented in due to super thin plastic. So this was by far the best option. It's just a baby head glued into a little stuffed bag, but it works. Made my son incredibly happy, so I suppose it's worth paying 4x to 5x times its actual worth. To be fair, all of the elf dolls are overpriced. I don't understand it, but that's okay...it's giving my son happy childhood memories, and those are priceless.",Positive
A beautiful picture and verse I framed this in black and the contrast makes it really stand out.  I just wish it were a little larger than 8x10.  It looks beautiful on my office wall and I love seeing the Bible verse every day.,Positive

Love the colors Love the colors! I thought the flowers (petals?) were an orange or coral but they're closer to the pink shades. I'm not normally a pink girl but I like this strap. Fit on my shiny new Canon T6. Really spruced it up and got a compliment on it while on my camera's inaugural trip to Watkin's Glen State Park. I had no fear of the strap slipping and the construction seems like quality and should last a long time.,Positive

"awesome!  perfect for our floating shelves in the kitchen. I really like the overall look of the brackets.  We are using them for floating shelves on a tiled backsplash/wall.

"SAFETY HACK! Great wick holder now more secure [[VIDEOID:32e9f03bca55e0e24c23e0e50c39dfce]] I took the hook, straightened it then folded in half, like a hair pin to where the end of it was even with the bottom circle.<br /> This enables me to make an adjustable height clip on the side of a container. I can adjust the height of the wick to the level of oil.<br /><br />SAFETY NOTE see vid FAR MORE SECURE! They way I hacked it it's not going to move unless somebody deliberately moves it. That's real important with oil candles",Positive

"Fun bath time surprise I bought these for my 4 year old son to get him excited about bath time and they worked like a charm.

"Perfect for my little niece I got these as a puzzle for my niece to play with. Then, when she outgrows it, we can hang it as a sign on her door or wall. It came out even better than I thought it would, and I had some pretty high expectations. She loves playing with the different letters with the different colors (she hasn’t quite realized they are meant to be put back in order but keep sorting them by color). Honestly I would buy this again for any new baby in the family.",Positive

"Real leather like Love this bag and using it daily since early this year. The description said it’s genuine leather. Not sure if it really is, but it’s aging like a leather would and the color has darkened a bit and the bag shows beautiful leather like wear and it still has some material odor inside, which doesn’t bother me. For the quality and price I got a Big Bang for the buck! Would buy again.",Positive

"What an awesome product. First off I have to say, I am a huge Bay Rum scent fan. And a plug for a local artisan here in Montana. All of that aside, this aftershave has become one of my favorite Bay Rum scented aftershaves. It leaves my skin feeling so good. I won't comment on the ingredient because I don't want to get them wrong. But it does not have the sharp bite that alcohol-based aftershaves have. It just goes on smooth, leaves your skin feeling amazing, and has a scent that stays with you all day long. I will definitely buy it again and try other scents from this artisan.",Positive

It was just the most pleasant of experiences from finding it, ordering it, thinking it would take about a week to get and then IT WAS IN MY MAILBOX TWO DAYS LATER!<br />Honestly, I couldn't be happier with this piece.

"Wonderful Addition! The 16"" Metal Circle Monogram with Name arrived exactly as I expected, and it arrived early!  The shipping was extremely quick, especially considering this is a custom order.  I read prior reviews about some of the metal edges being rough and sharp, so I expected that; the sharp edges were mostly on the curved letters and the more intricate parts of the design.  There were not nearly as many sharp edges as I expected, but that is the reason for four stars instead of five.  If I had ordered this before reading other reviews, I would have been slightly upset, but when thinking about the manufacturing process for a piece of metal... well, one should expect some sharp edges!<br />The monogram will hang on my front door and I am likely to order from this company in the future.  Overall, I am very pleased and am considering for using this item as gifts in the future!  The items looks professional and classy.  It will make a nice addition to my front door décor!  Thank You!",Positive

It looks exactly like the picture. For someone who likes hippos.  This was a unique item. Great color. Will order more.,Positive
Pretty I really like the ring. It’s comfortable. I bought it for my thumb. I can get it over my knuckle and it will fit nicely in the slimmer part past my knuckle. What I don’t like is it has gotten a bit bent when the end got caught on something. It gets caught on things easily. It will get caught in hair when I hug someone. Because of that I haven’t worn it as often as I thought I would.,Positive
Love the glitter This was great a great shirt but must have been folded hot bc I can’t get the lines out of the ears.

"Cute Penny Date Gift I just absolutely LOVE my key chains. The pennies arrived nice and shiny-in mint condition and looked amazing.<br />After a few months of use, the penny has dulled some which is to be expected with hand oils coming into contact with it and just regular wear and tear. The most important part is that the dates look perfect and unchanged.<br />The O rings are good quality and because of that, I don't have to worry about the penny coming off.<br />Shipping was fast and they came in an adorable little gift bag inside of the box.<br />A lovely idea and wonderfully executed. I highly recommend this item and this seller!",Positive

When the rings were delivered, I was extremely pleased with the quality and beauty of them.  Though they were small and dainty, each name was clearly readable, including the birth dates inside.  The boys proudly presented these to their Mom and she was delighted!  She hasn't taken them off since!  I highly recommend this craftsperson.  The rings were quickly created and delivered and everything was perfectly done.",Positive
"Menu Planner / Grocery List Purchased this for my A5 *Carpe Diem* planner. Fits perfectly. Each page has a two column section for a grocery list on the front, and on the back it has a menu planner for all 7 days, plus space for notes and meal prep reminders. The grocery list is lined and has a &#34;check off&#34; box for when it's added to your shopping cart. Nice, quality paper and easy to read font. It will be very useful to have everything on one piece of paper. The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is I think they could have included a lot more sheets for the price. Pretty expensive for what you get.",Positive

They obviously show a large sticker on the picture, which is probably around $11.00.<br />I think the one I got was a little too pricy for the size of it.",Positive
"Beautiful, solid bracelet This is a lovely bracelet. Right on target for price versus weight. It’s a little on the larger side for me (I bought the small/medium size), but I only have a 6” wrist so most bracelets tend to be oversized. It’s very shiny and has great detail.

As others have said, this item makes a lovely gift for anyone who needs a little help with reading, but doesn't want to always be rummaging through a back-pack for their close-up glasses.  FIVE STARS!",Positive

"Cute but letters missing ink This dainty ring is very cute and comfortable! It also shipped super fast!! My only complaint is that some of my letters were black and others weren’t. I’m not sure why some were missing the ink (the L’s in the middle)... it didn’t bother me enough to return it, but I probably wouldn’t order more for that price just because I’m not sure how long it will be legible. Hopefully it lasts!",Positive

Great but small This is such a super cute sign and the attachments are perfect. However read the size carefully! It is small and not the tall one like I prefer. It's my fault I didn't pay attention to the measurements however I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. I still keep this on my front porch however it is hard to see because it is so short and small.,Positive
Simple yet impactful It looks great and others often notice it.,Positive

Several times a day one of our grandchildren will touch their lamps and send their love. We recognize which grandchild communicated by the color that appears on our lamps. We then return the love by touching that lamp that changed color.,Positive

"So so beautiful on my daughters mirror [[VIDEOID:4a6a5c8ac76d0c8a17b93a7889c4e058]] Loved the decal. What I would say, is that it looked like someone had printed it from their personal computer because of the way it came packaged, but idc honestly, it still looked great. I will say that it was my first time doing a decal and it came out beautifully on my daughter’s mirror. Idk why they asked about the sheerness, but it’s definitely solid black. No sheerness to it. Perfect decal! I cut it in half to make it closer to the bottom since we had a skinny oval mirror. I would’ve went right accord if the mirror was larger. But still beautiful 😻",Positive

"Wow! I've been looking for small hostess gifts to take with me on a trip overseas this Fall and literally stumbled across these soaps the other day. I couldn't have asked for more! They're the perfect size to carry in my backpack (see my photo with penny for size comparison) and delightfully scented -- fragrant but not overwhelmingly so. Each of the six plastic bags contains two bars, one on top of another, for a total of 12 bars.<br /><br />I did have a small problem when placing the order as I couldn't select more than one scent at a time as indicated, but Shawn from Homespun Goods replied to my query straightaway, saying to just message them my choices after I placed my order. That happened on Sep 14 and they arrived today, Sep 17 -- super fast. Shawn even included a personal thank you note and a few extra bars in the package. Sweet, I get to try one myself, too! If it's anything less than wonderful I'll update my review. :-) As it is I'm very impressed and grateful I found Homespun Goods. Thank you, Shawn!",Positive

"Have followed this artist for more than a year, happy her work is here on Amazon! I saw Yoolie's jewelry in a store in Ithaca a year ago and have been kicking myself ever since for not buying any.  Then I got a gift card from Amazon for a thank you at work and wanted to buy myself something nice, and not just apply it to an autoship or something!<br /><br />I was shocked and thrilled to learn Yoolie's jewelry is carried on Amazon.  It is all so beautiful and unique.  And despite how it looks the necklace is very light and comfortable.  I could not be happier!",Positive

Just what I wanted These earrings are beautiful! The color is exactly as shown. I especially like that this jewelry is handcrafted. My order came with a hand written thank you from the business owner. That personal touch really impressed me.  I'll be sure to shop with them again!,Positive
Prints are very pretty and modern with vivid colors Items arrived on time and were packaged very well.  Prints are very pretty and modern with vivid colors.  A word of caution:  the ink will smudge!  Handle the prints only by the corners and make sure your hands and frames are completely dry.  The ink smudged on the light beige background on one of my prints while I was framing so I hung the smudged print higher than eye level.  Thankfully the smudge is not visible to others unless one looks closely at the print.<br /><br />UPDATE: Customer service is excellent.  They offered to replace the smudged print for free.  Thank you again!,Positive

My granddaughter needed these for starting school and I was told about it at the last minute.  She started today and everything is labeled.  they say they go through the dishwasher so we'll see.  I didn't get the ones for clothing but will if we have a need.  Other types were saying 2 weeks or so for delivery.  And so many choices of pictures, fonts and colors.  I would definitely buy again.",Positive

"Love Never Fails was our theme for our 2019 International Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses. This is truly special to me as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  I saw this and HAD to have it!  My mother in law is getting married and since this was our theme for our 2019 International Convention, I had to order it as a gift for her.  I know she will love it as much as I do!  That was our last convention before Covid, and she was able to attend it as well.  I even wrote a poem with the same title!",Positive

"Oh my gosh- buying another one, this is awesome! I like to fidget but couldn't figure out what a good fidget option is for me. I LOVE this little thing! I bought a small one and I have large hands so I am going to also buy a large one, too. This one will be great for my purse to carry when I'm waiting somewhere and just needing to fiddle with something on the go. But I can't believe how satisfying this is for my hands. I bought the standard weave and I was kind of worried that there might be some difficulty moving them around, but there isn't at all!  Personally, I don't think I'd want to have a more loose weave as there is enough room to spin the individual rings or to sort of push them around one another- for me, I feel like one less ring would make this too loose and not as easy to quietly manipulate.  They don't seem to lock together at all and it is nice and quiet. Also, I don't have that metallic-ey smell on my hands. I am so happy I found these.",Positive
Perfect prints for our guest room! These prints are exactly what I needed for my guest room. I love that you can choose what size suits your space best. Perfect! 👌,Positive

"These are fantastic. Ordered two but it was still a little ... These are fantastic. Ordered two but it was still a little shy on the type of coverage I wanted on my tree - I should have gone with the longer ones. They are very well done, but I was a little disappointed that the ends were just the string looped in a knot and not something a bit nicer (like a metal ring) but that is something I could do myself if I want. Packaging was very nice as well and they included a little felted sheep which my son liked.",Positive

The cutters are beyond cute, functional, and her customer service is top notch!!

The only problem is she has SO many designs to choose from :)",Positive

"UPDATE!!! Beautiful, but unwearable [[VIDEOID:6224e89c101778a9bbb6a7581db20281]] UPDATE: after reaching out to the seller they sent me a replacement that I have been wearing for several days without incident. I love this ring and am so happy to have it. If you do have issues contact the seller they are very responsive and I could not be happier with their customer service!!<br /><br />The ring looks as is described and is beautiful to look at. Unfortunately that is all I can say about it. Cause wearing it for one day caused my finger to turn black where the ring was. There was also a sharp bit in the back that cut into my finger. The video shows what it looked like after I took it off. The ring claims to be sterling silver but I doubt that after wearing it. I have many rings I wear 24/7 that are real sterling silver and have never given me an issue. I have reached out to seller with my expirence and will add update if they respnd.",Positive
"Beautifully hand painted.  Rich colors. I love this tray! The colors are rich and warm. The design with it's grapes and pomegranates reflect my childhood memories of harvesting grapes with the whole family... which were made into wine, or eaten at the table along with pomegranates picked off of our grandparents tree.  I especially love that this tray was hand painted in Italy where all my grandparents immigrated from. I'm going to buy a second one!!!",Positive

Much better than expected I ordered this one because it was dark and looked cute. It is our 5th tag - all previous started to look bad after couple months (we live by the ocean and boy likes water). Tag arrived fast. Looked super cute. It is smaller then all previous and surprisingly writing is more visible. It gets a little foggy after few dives in the ocean but can be restored to shine with simple wash. I will be ordering more.<br />If I was going to suggest improvement the attachment ring (we got two sizes) can be sourced from a little better material.,Positive
"Chic and well made Beautiful earrings and well made. I tend to prefer very dainty jewelry so these are my statement earrings - I think for most though, these would be understated. Goes with a lot. I’ve worn them with jeans and with summer dresses.",Positive

"Nice but already chipping the black paint Got these earrings for my wife since she liked the color, which is looks like purple iridescence.<br /><br />They are light and comfortable to wear, and she started wearing them the day they arrived.  She did not experience any itching while wearing the earrings.<br /><br />One concern though is that the black paint on the earring posts is already chipping away after just wearing it for the first time, and you can see a bit of the silver metal underneath.  It seems that when the earring backing or stopper is placed on the earring post to hold the earring in place, it rubs or chips on the black paint of the posts.<br /><br />Overall, she still likes the earrings.",Positive
"Just Beautiful! I just love this piece. It reminds me of our Powder, whom we lost in June to a brain tumor :(  Anyway, when I look at it, it makes be smile and feel warm inside!

"Great gift! What a great gift! I ordered the 2016 penny and copper disc with my granddaughter's name for an add-on gift for her graduation. It was packaged beautifully and I was delighted when I opened it. The key ring is adorable and the pictures on the site are exact replicas. I will be ordering these in the future for other &#34;year&#34; occasions. The price was very reasonable and most importantly, the customer service was exceptional. I had a question and the seller responded immediately and took care of my concern. Thank you so much! I love hand made items and finding this on amazon (which I trust!) made my day. I will most definitely buy from Silverado Jewelry again.",Positive
Great cleansing balm! So far I love this product. It has a great smell and is a nice thick balm so I can use it to remove waterproof mascara without it running into my eyes and irritating them like other cleansing oils I have used. I use this as the first step in my triple cleanse and it remove makeup amazingly even the most stubborn waterproof stuff. I haven’t noticed any clogged pores since they use non comedogenic oils.,Positive

Excellent quality and quick shipping. Great novelty to go along with the round tuit medallions.,Positive
"I love this product, but would prefer simpler, easy to use bottle. I love the product, but I am not crazy about the packaging.  It is beautifully packaged, but I use it in the shower and the pump seems awkward -- would love to get this in a squeezable bottle with perhaps a disc lid for easy use.  I use it with a nylon back brush, and it is a pain to hold the brush and the bottle and pump.  Seems like the price for this is too high, and an option for perhaps a refill size bottle without the fancy stuff would be great.",Positive

Had to look at the website to figure out how to make it fit right, but it's very simple.  So easy to open - to roll on then just cinch it back up when it's on.  I love the look of the beads.

"Stunning, quality pendant It's difficult to find a quality almond pendant at all. I was quite pleased to finally come across this one. It is even better than I'd hoped.<br /><br />The sellers followed through on the offer in the description for a custom chain length upon request. It has been a hassle to request with different sellers so I was grateful for this aspect to be made so stress-free.<br /><br />The shipping wasn't two days or even a week but it still arrived more than two weeks ahead of schedule.<br /><br />The detail is very fine and the pendant has pleasing weight to it. I was impressed with the clean careful packaging aesthetics as well.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about buying from this seller, all I can say is that I can't think of a single negative involved in this purchase. I would absolutely buy from them again.",Positive
Unique I used these to hang photos at a party. Worked great. It has 9 settings for the lights - a lot more than other light strings. I used tiny command hooks and they worked great in a rented building. Came right off the wall without a trace.,Positive

"Cute set of bracelets I like this set of bracelets. The colors coordinate very well with each other. They are adjustable and very comfortable to wear. I like the silver circle charms that hang off of two of the bracelets. The only complaint I would have is that the description says 4 bracelets but there are only three included. Even the pictures show three bracelets, so I wasn't expecting more than that. Very cute set of bracelets, glad I got them.",Positive
"Stylish holiday cards!! Love these cards.  I appreciated the clever images when I saw them on Amazon.  When the actual cards arrived they exceeded my expectations.

Good job. Fun product Perfect. Funny. I can drive a mini van as long as people know I dont take it seriously.,Positive
"It is adorable. Edited: I initially I had written a positive comment. The piece is nice. But the necklace turns rusty in just a matter of days. Even if you don’t wear it everyday. The little charm has remained in good shape. If you buy it, just know that the necklace is of poor quality.",Positive
Wife loves it! I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Very attractive piece and high quality construction. My only suggestion would be to apply varnish to the wood to protect it from drips and spills. It is stained but not varnished.,Positive
"Great window covering. Fast shipping but somewhat hard to install. I loved the design of this, but they stretch if you arent careful, distorting it a little bit. It worked, but i see the flaws. Drivers side turned out good, passengers side ehhhh it will do only because I dont want to spend the $ for another set. Best advice, install on a hot summer day or use a hair dryer. If possible, use 2 people. One to hold the hair dryer, the other to keep the decal in place and not lift. The trees were the worst. On both sides they folded. Gotta be careful of those little things. I did receive them about a week sooner than expected. So that was great! Extra star just for the fast shipping.",Positive

Much better than the bracelet that comes with the Leaf! I love this bracelet! My wrists are too large to comfortably wear the strap that came with my Leaf. I also was not a huge fan of the tan strap. Ordered this strap (and another one from the same seller) and I could not be happier! You provide your wrist measurement so you know it is going to fit. The bracelet is well made and comfortable to wear.,Positive

"Outstanding deal and a great wallet! This is an outstanding deal and a really great wallet no matter the price.  Made in the US from all US materials and the quality shows.  Most other places would charge at least twice this price.  I have been using a Craft and Lore wallet which is equal to this quality but much more expensive.  Again, at any price this is a nice wallet but at this price it’s a steal!  If you’re looking for a thin, minimalist leather wallet get one of these while you can!",Positive

I would definitely purchase more by the same seller,Positive

"Could be Citrine I used an app called “Rock Identifier” and I scanned the “yellow sapphire” I received and it claimed it was Citrine actually.

"Doesn't feel heavy on the ear lobes. Beautiful, light-weight earrings!  Great addition to my Disney jewelry collection.  Of  course I had to ask others if it was heavy on my lobes (I had a couple of snarky remarks) but the majority of the people confirmed they weren't.",Positive

"Easy to Use, Looks Great I used these on one wall of my child's nursery and they look great! I was concerned when I received the package because it seemed like there was no way so few sheets of decals could cover the area I wanted. After I cut them apart and started blocking them out along the wall, though, it became apparent that there were more than enough to cover the whole area.  They are very easy to apply and I have moved a few  after initial application without any trouble.",Positive

"Beautiful and exactly what I wanted This is a beautiful necklace and pendant. I wear it all of the time. I sleep with it and work out in it every single day through multiple workouts a day. Because of that, it tarnishes easily and often but I bought a silver polishing rag and it works PERFECTLY to keep my necklace and pendent looking brand new. My fiancé loves it as well. I feel honored to be able to wear something that represents my love and support for our loved ones in law enforcement.",Positive

Carrier is USPS withing the USA, just Standard First Class Stamp mail, which I am assuming is where the few cents shipping fee goes to. Overall great product would buy again.",Positive

Best ring I ever brought I will start by saying I was very disappointed in the mailing system my package was damaged and of course it wasn’t from the company who sent out this beautiful ring it was indeed the mailing system I was happy when I opened the package the box the ring was in was completely destroyed but the ring was in a tiny bag that it was unharmed I’m so thankful for that because this ring is beautiful the detail in this ring is amazing it is definitely a tall ring it does sit high but I love it the blue shines so beautifully and the white gem shines just as bright my finger has not turned green so that’s a plus because my skin is Sensitive the pins in the ring are sturdy so I don’t feel like my ring is going to break and it is true to size but I’m not sure what else to say only that I will be buying more from this company because the craftsmanship is amazing and I recommend this ring to anyone who loves a little bling in their life and likes tall rings if you love something different than this is the ring for you and I will say one day of wearing this ring I got so many compliments on it I love this ring :),Positive

"Five Stars Awesome sign. Pretty, and it works! 😃",Positive
"Well constructed but did not like color These seem solidly made and assume will have a decent lifespan if not caught on something and subjected to a lot of stress. I was not a fan of how the two rows of beads are so tightly bound to one another than it almost seemed as though they had been glued together. Purely personal preference, but I’d rather have two single strand bead bracelets that a double-strand that acts as though it is one fused strand. I bought the brown and was not a fan of the color, but that is also purely personal preference.<br /><br />I’ll not speak to any supposed mystical powers of the beads as I assume there are none.",Positive
Perfect It works as described and it’s not greasy,Positive

OMG!!!! I love it! The owl is soooo cute. This is the cutest thing I have ever seen. I am new to sewing and honestly didn't know about Enamel Needle Minder but this thing is amazing.

"Great Quality I have been a phlebotomist for 10 years and deal with different types of people all day. A lot of negative, dark, angry people lately and I was looking for something to protect me and my energy. After 1 week I can honestly say it works and I see a huge improvement in my weeks and energy. The type of people I interact with has been mainly positive and rarely negative. Any negative interaction is handled in a positive way without my mental or emotions being effected. It is great quality, stretchy yet strong. I have already gotten 3 compliments on it. The necklace sent as a extra gift was a huge surprise and is just as great as the bracelet. I read that each bead is filled with Love  by the bracelet crafter and I think that’s huge in the quality and performance of this product.",Positive

"It's The Little Things That Matter My holder was packed firmly so it arrived in one piece and looks amazing.  I find it rather soothing to watch the smoke rise out of the top.  What I really loved was the short handwritten note as well the sample sticks to try along with a list of other scents they offer with cute descriptions.  It's clear that they make these with care and appreciate their customers.  I'm burning a ""Pacific Surf"" stick and think I just fell in love with this scent!",Positive

"The Green Quench is my favorite – my skin is so supple after using it I waited two weeks before writing this review to track the progress of my skin using 16J products, and I am thrilled to say that everything exceeds my expectations! I suffer from a skin condition that has resulted in scarring, and I am extremely careful what I apply to my sensitive skin. My scarring, texture and softness has improved significantly since using 16J. Every other day I’ve used the scrub, which is just the right texture – neither too harsh nor soft, just right – and coupled with the soothing oil in it, leaves my skin feeling gently buffed and renewed. I even use it on my face one a week. The Green Quench is my favorite – my skin is so supple after using it, I often find myself rubbing my arms throughout the day because I can’t believe how soft they remain hours after stepping out of the shower. At night I apply Mo’ Butter to scars on my legs, and have noticed enough improvement where I’ve worn shorts for the first time this year. It is quite rich so I apply it sparingly to my face after the shower and at night, and my skin retains noticeably more moisture than with any other cream I’ve used. The Lip Rico with a hint of cocoa is not only great in helping my chapped lips, but is also delicious! With all the different oils in these products I was initially concerned before my purchase about the fragrance, but it is a very subtle and appealing scent that doesn’t compete with my light fragrance. With 60% of what we apply to our skin absorbed, my skin is loving this new diet, and feels simultaneously healthy, scrubbed and soft. I’m a convert!",Positive
Love them Perfect,Positive
Would recommend Love these.. my second pair from this seller. Lightweight and cute. Get many compliments. The clear backs that come with the earrings don’t keep them in place well but I just take some from other earrings that are tighter and it keeps them from moving around in my ear,Positive
"Just as described Stones were arranged just as I had requested, delivered much sooner than expected.  I ordered this ring to commemorate driving thru a rainbow and seeing the rainbow hit the hood of my car, then as I drove thru it, I could see the air around me sparkling with little prisms floating in the air.  Incredible experience, how many lifetimes would it take for that to happen again?  My ring is a perfect reminder of that day. :-)",Positive
Great Purchase!!! I was really thrilled with this purchase!! My daughter looked so beautiful in it. The fit was true to size and has a little stretch to allow my little one to wear it well into the year. I recommend this product to all looking for a unique and well designed personal birthday look for their princess!!!,Positive

Another reason to like this wallet is that it hold 4 cards, 2 on the ouside and 2 on the inside. I imagine I can add an extra card or two if I double up. A nice stainless steel clip on the inside hold my cash securely. It comes packed in a Toros Craft drawstring sack!<br /><br />Excellent wallet with a great price.",Positive

"Smells like cows Almost 2 months later, and it still smells like a farm (not a typical leather smell). Otherwise, it's well made. The leather is not of the finest quality, yet definitely durable. It is also perfect for laser engraving. We did air it out for over 2 weeks (as suggested). Even outside in fresh air. Also cleaned it with a leather cleaner. The smell is off-putting for me, personally. Still attempting to air it out as I would love to use it. The pockets are the best part, in my opinion. I have attempted to take photos illustrating the pockets. Worth the price? Yes. Would I order again? I'm on the fence, due to the odor.",Positive

"Sweet Little Reminder I picked this out for my son who is a young man soon to be married and out on his own. It's a sweet little reminder to show I care and a cool conversation piece with the Morse code spelling out ""I love you"".<br />  It is slight in appearance and almost as small as a rubber band on the wrist but doesn't feel fragile. A nice option when the person you're buying for doesn't like bigger or clunky bracelets.",Positive
Five Stars GO GIANTS!,Positive
Beautiful and inspirational My daughter loved it. It’s a constant reminder and I love hopes and dreams for her!,Positive
"Loved the bracelets, the necklaces seem cheap My partner, and I love to get matching jewelry or things that come in pairs, so that when we are separated for the day, when one of us goes to work or out with a friend, we can have a piece of each other to look at and remember, and love during the day. we got this set mostly for the bracelets but we thought the necklaces would work too. After opening and trying everything on, we decided that the necklaces looked a little cheap, but we absolutely love the bracelets. The necklaces are on a cheap black cord, and the stones that are used in the necklace are only in the front part and you can see the rest of the resin that they used to produce the  Piece is just clear and empty. They could have put more stones in or used a Sidder amount of resin, and it would’ve looked better. The bracelets on the other hand, are super adjustable, which helps, because I have very thick wrists, and in the middle of the bracelet, there is a magnet that connects to the other bracelet like I showed her the picture, and it is so cute!  I love that when I get close to my partner, it connects to his bracelet and it reminds us of our connection and love for each other!",Positive
