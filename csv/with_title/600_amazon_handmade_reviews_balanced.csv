"Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!",Negative
Loved it Beautiful and well made.,Negative
Not what I expected at all Not what I expected at all,Negative
very sad bracket arrived Broken.  ,Negative
Even smaller in real life Do not waste your hard earned money it's as thick as a quarter at the base and light as a feather.,Negative
Map is severely cropped ! Product is NOT as described...  Save your money on this one!!  Map is severely cropped...,Negative
Cheap It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.,Negative
"Disney shirt Soft, true to size",Negative
"Picture does not match the earrings The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.",Negative
Poor quality I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.,Negative
"Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.",Negative
"Already Dying After 3 Weeks I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.",Negative
"The items I ordered were misleading The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..",Negative
"Just buy the key It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.",Negative
"Very cheaply made but not for a cheap price I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again",Negative
Allergies Have allergy. There is too much bronzer. And smell disgusting (,Negative
It’s nice but small It’s pretty but it’s small,Negative
Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.,Negative
"This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is ... This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is seriously crooked.  It's very apparent and for that I'm disappointed.  Had it been flush or closer to, I'd love it.",Negative
Underestimated gift This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.,Negative
Two Stars As described but packaging could have been better for the price,Negative
"Decent smelling, long time to ship though Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)",Negative
Damaged Great looking item. It came in bent- not too happy.,Negative
"Don't waste your $$ or time This is a complete rip off!!!  Don't waste your $$ or time!  It turned within a few days of wearing it!!!!!!!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE, DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!!!!!!!!",Negative
Not impressed This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be,Negative
Wasn’t good for nose ring. Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.,Negative
"Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.",Negative
"Beautiful but broke an hour after wearing! The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.",Negative
"Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.",Negative
It smells nice [[VIDEOID:8b03a70c569f973cb64c965e426c8895]] Whipped?  Not so much. I got a half jar of brown scented oil. But it does have a nice scent.,Negative
☹️ Not happy it was a bad purchase,Negative
Wouldn’t buy again. Slightly blurry and it’s just a sticker over the blade couldn’t use the blade for anything. I know it’s to be collected but I still expect a knife to have a usable blade.,Negative
"Not quite right I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.",Negative
Don’t waste your time I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.,Negative
Smaller than we wanted Ok but smaller than we thought.  Always read the measurements!,Negative
Too small Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.,Negative
Very small It was just a small ceramic ornament cute but certainly not worth $25,Negative
Not happy... Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.,Negative
Too Pink Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.,Negative
Chunky It's kind of chunky and it bumped it falls apart but for the most part it stays together and does his job but it just looks a little ghetto and really big,Negative
One Star Very bad made broke same day my daughter got it,Negative
"Looked so cute for 5 minutes They came in so cute and after the first day, with careful hand-washing, all of the decals started peeling off of both of them. So disappointing.",Negative
One Star It was not what I expected,Negative
Disappointing I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.,Negative
"Not worth it. I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed ""sterling silver "" which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!",Negative
Save your money! No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.,Negative
The clasp broke after one wearing. Poorly made. The clasp broke after one wearing.,Negative
"Incorrect description of product I was very disappointed to find that that this 2-pack of frames, which were both to hold 4 X 6 photos, turned out to be one for a 4 X 6 photo, and one for a 5 X 7 photo. They will not be the matched pair I had planned on.",Negative
poor quality The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again,Negative
Poor quality Poor quality fabric messy writing<br />Looks like a felt pin was used<br />Plus totally gross a black hair was inside when I unfolded it,Negative
"Great Idea, Terrible execution. So sad. What I got was really awful. It was not hand printed, it was computer generated, and in addition several words were misspelled. These folks took a great concept; got in a hurry and totally ruined it. So sad because it was a great idea. They probably should have charged more and done it right.",Negative
"Flag Many of the stars where misfired they did not even look close to stars, the instruction video show a piece to install the stickers and it did not come with one.",Negative
The hanger is beautiful but the wording is not sturdy at all! The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.,Negative
Make the poster bigger Dislike to smallpox,Negative
Does not smell .... I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.,Negative
"Just a photo not a poster It is just a photo printed. Same thing you could do at Walmart for a few cents. The print is a nice print, but not close to being worth 13 dollars. Maybe $1.",Negative
"Very small Will not fit average adult wrist, very small",Negative
Just a piece of paper I thought this would be something other than just a peice of photo paper - wrong! Just type this up yourself and go to Walmart to print it. It will be the same thing and cheaper.,Negative
Not what I expected Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.,Negative
Doesn't stick to anything  ! You just as well kiss a five dollar and see if it sticks to anything. All you're doing is wasting five dollars.,Negative
It broke. Broke 2 days after outting it on.,Negative
"Trying to return Have requested return over a week ago, no response from seller.  Item not quite up to par.",Negative
I made a buying mistake. Didn't read the description clearly. I thought I was buying the dish.  Turns out I could use the item so no return.,Negative
Tarnish Tarnished within a week!,Negative
One Star terrible quality & one of the birds upside down even.,Negative
picture of a picture..like our you serious? picture of a picture..like our you serious? i could have screen shot the pic on my phone and printed it out myself ..get it together..false ad..you should be embarassed!,Negative
Not good quality They bend to easily and mess up design.,Negative
Not happy! This is not at all what I believed it to be.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning,Negative
Not what Is pictured This is not what the picture is. I’m upset it’s a rooster. And it’s not easy to stamp the egg. I would have been fine with it not stamping correctly it’s for my daughter but I didn’t want to stamp out eggs with a rooster when in the pictures it’s a hen.,Negative
"Paper thin & flimsy Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.",Negative
Trash It was just a few prints. Nothing special. I guess you get what you pay for.,Negative
It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint,Negative
Not worth the money. Will tarnish. Not worth the money.,Negative
"Lavendar Sage melt - disappointed ""not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.",Negative
"Cheap. Made in China. Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.",Negative
Extremely Disappointed Unfortunately I am not very satisfied with my necklace that my husband got me for Mother’s Day as cute as it is it’s very delicate and it broke and I’ve only had it for like five weeks so I would highly recommend NOT buying this necklace!,Negative
Ring I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.,Negative
"Not worth the price Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.",Negative
"Smells like caramel, not pappy's pipe. Smells nothing like a pipe or even what's in the description.  They smell like Werther's caramel.  Very disappointed.",Negative
"looks nice Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.",Negative
Not Kawaii- knock off; tiny container Not Kawaii- knock off; tiny container.,Negative
to little to narrow more like for a small child it was so so thin narrow ring.,Negative
"CHEAP QUALITY! They were thin and danity, which is what i wanted.. but if you plan on taking them on and off every day, good luck! They are very thin, extremely hard to latch and they bend and distort very easily. I could make these at home with some wire for less then what i paid for these. Save your money!!",Negative
Not at all as advertised Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!,Negative
waste of my money and damage to my skin first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !,Negative
"Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.",Negative
"Just host rock, nothing shiny. Just cut<br />The crap<br />This is<br />All dirt",Negative
"Could have been better. They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.",Negative
"Not worth it Was great until I was exfoliating in the shower. Long story short, it broke after 2 weeks",Negative
Waste of money Letters are super small and light weight. A complete waste of $60! Does not look anything like the advertisement. Very dissatisfied and seller will not let me return!,Negative
Nope Dangling stone fell off first time wearing,Negative
"Cheap metal, disappointment Finish wore off in less than a month.<br /><br />Got what what I paid for......and apparently I paid for garbage.",Negative
"Loves nice things Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.",Negative
"Very delicate Very frail, broke easily. Should be sold for less.",Negative
"Fake This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.",Negative
Think before you order The quality of the chain is fine but the arrow itself looks like it was already used and seemed oxidized. You can even see it that they both are different colors. Maybe I’ve got a copy that was returned before. I don’t know but I was disappointed,Negative
Don't like it Leaves a sticky feel on my hair and has a weird smell that's unplesant.,Negative
"Eh.. It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.",Negative
Cheap Not worth buying,Negative
Cheap quality Cheap quality. The bracelet didn’t even last me two months.,Negative
"Do NOT purchase!!!!! I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them. I've worn backless shoes many times, & could easily keep them on. These do not stay on my feet! Sad thing is, they are non returnable!!! What a rip off! Guess I learned my lesson!",Negative
Fell apart After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!,Negative
"Boo This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.",Negative
Cute but could be designed better Lightweight earring but they keep twisting backwards and getting caught or twisted within the post,Negative
I hate the font. It says sweet dreading.  The return amount on this product was $70. It really is I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to… And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.,Negative
"it is too fragile, mine fell and broke before use It is too fragile easy to break",Negative
"No lo recomiendo 👎 Lo compre en octubre para regalo de Navidad de mi esposo y para sorpresa extremadamente pequeño y nada que ver para el precio, pobre calidad, el vendedor nada que te ayuda simplemente aun diciendole que esta nuevo en su cajita no acepta la devolucion por estar pasado de tiempo. Nada profesional al menos podia ayudar al cliente aunque hiciera un descuento. NO RECOMIENDO HACERLE COMPRAS A ESTE VENDEDOR. 👎👎👎",Negative
"No Frame In fairness, the small print does disclose that a frame is not included.  But the picture clearly displays a frame.  $16.00 for a sheet of rag paper.",Negative
Zero value for money Not worth it. It’s basically printed paper. I don’t know how tf I’m supposed to stick it up the wall. Should definitely come with a glue to peel off.,Negative
"Bad Smelling It has a bad smelling undertone that makes the whole house stink. It does initially smell like lemons, but after a few minutes smells really bad (waxy/rotten fruit/sour).",Negative
Sterling silver? Definitely not. That was the worst piece of jewelry I've ever bought. Costume jewelry lasted longer than this earring. Turned my ear green n black around the pierced area. The so-called m sterling metal started crumble peeling off with some time type of crushing around the ball.... Waste of money. Quality mi rassss,Negative
Cute but smells like mold Disappointed!! It is the perfect size and would be a great addition except it smells. Have tried a few things and still can't get it to not stink like mold!,Negative
"SO VERY SMALL if you are ordering this for a small child, this would be great.",Negative
"It’s the same shape but not red Pretty brownish, looks like dirt.",Negative
One Star Very small and bendable,Negative
I can only smell it if It’s right under my nose Can’t really smell anything,Negative
What you see is not what you get. What you see here is NOT what you get. It's more of a necklace pendant rather than a dog/cat tag. And i say necklace beacise they literally sent me a necklace. I only will not be returning this beacuse it does have my info on the tag so it will suffice so that my cat can roam. But really they advertise this product the worng way.,Negative
Now what I was expecting. Not what I was expecting. This was literally a copied 8x10 print.,Negative
Pretty but Received broken sent back,Negative
Great colors Nice print but when I saw ad on line it looked like a print stretched on a box frame but it was a flat 8 by 10 print.,Negative
Super cute but they broke almost immediately These earrings were super cute and I was very excited to wear them.  They fit perfectly and looked amazing.  The only problem is that after wearing them for not even 24 hours the bar broke off from the stem.  They are super cute earrings and I wish I could’ve gotten more time to wear them before their early demise.,Negative
Two Stars Pretty but too heavy for me,Negative
Poor quality The picture of the stackable rings is very misleading. The rope ring is great but the solid one is a very cheap thin piece of copper wire. Would never purchase from this vendor again.,Negative
"Horrible, literally 2 days after I purchased this bracelet ... Horrible , literally 2 days after I purchased this bracelet for my 3 months old baby , his wrist was green and the bracelet was brown. Horrible product , do not get it !",Negative
"Broke the second day I wore it! The chain is really cheap, so it broke the second day I wore it . I lost one of the jewels when it broke. Disappointed.",Negative
Too strong I couldn't stand Too strong  I couldn't stand it,Negative
FAKE!!!!! [[VIDEOID:e50a3a286858da45b9e51d30be27c542]] I didn’t know obsidian stone turns clear after exposure to multiple showers and dish washing what a versatile stone!!!  🙄🙄🙄,Negative
"Not what I was expecting at all. The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!",Negative
start unraveling as soon as cut. Have to cut each one and they unravel rapidly.,Negative
Broken Beads Unfortunately this bracelet broke. I was so disappointed. The packaging was beautiful and I thought I purchased a good solid product BUT to my disappointment the strings didn’t hold the beads. Poor quality,Negative
Drastically overpriced 18mm is 0.70 inches in length.  At $20+ you should be getting 2 handfuls of raw moonstone considering you can get a 2 inch moonstone for around $1.50 at your local Mast General Store.  Do your research folks.  Don't let someone on the internet aping off the current fad of faux spiritualists rip you off.,Negative
Looks like a picture printed from CVS I was very disappointed I'm this item. It was small and unframed. It was basically a small picture that looked like it had been printed out. Not as described,Negative
Cute but not what I thought Not what I thought,Negative
"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SHOP!!!! I ordered a size large in women’s for my daughter who likes things oversize. The shirt is tiny. Unfortunately they do not offer returns or exchanges so I’m stuck with a shirt that would probably fit a five-year-old. I do not recommend buying from the shop, especially due to their return policy.",Negative
Size is incorrect description Not big at all said not fit across the front of car like pictured it is a few inches long is all very small.,Negative
"Not very easy to use Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.",Negative
Not real it’s not a real crystal,Negative
"Poor quality We thought the product was made very cheaply, especially considering the price. The product also came damaged.",Negative
Disappointing Tarnished on me very quickly.  I thought it was stainless steel but doesn’t seem to be. Cute while it lasted though. Wore for about a month.,Negative
"It's on photo paper I have other decor that's actually printed on old dictionary paper, this is just a photo copy (for the same price I paid for real dictionary paper). Returned.",Negative
Mine came with a bend in the corner and the ... Mine came with a bend in the corner and the photo stock paper had an aged look to it. It's ok - not wowed by it.,Negative
Not good I just found another site where I will reorder the 2 I had made for my newlywed children The engraving was sloppy,Negative
Okay! Cup had a scratch on it! Sorta noticeable.,Negative
"Cheap looks nice, but broke after two weeks of use.<br />Metal is not strong and the stones cracked",Negative
Don’t buy it! This came as a piece of cheap paper. Don’t buy it!,Negative
"Disappointed The handwriting matches perfectly, HOWEVER.  I have only worn the bracket 2x and it is already changing colors. You can see it on the v and e.",Negative
One Star Does not look like it layvasbthenoucture shows,Negative
Cute but not sturdy These are very cute but not sturdy at all. Mine were broken when I received them.,Negative
Can’t return The T shirt is fine but I found something I like better and this is ineligible for returns. The description was very misleading and now I’m out $25.,Negative
"Damaged Came late, bent up and parts unglued",Negative
"Waste of money I followed all the instructions for putting this up. I was super excited to put this up in my toddlers room. When it was time to peel the rest of the paper off (the sticker had been up on the wall), it peeled all the letters off with it. I tried several different ways and it ended up ripping the lettering. Had to throw it in the trash.",Negative
For metal mailboxes only They would not stick at all to a plastic mailbox. Had to throw them away.,Negative
Poorly made!!! One of the white stone was missing when I received the ring. Poorly made. Seller never contacted. Won't suggest this product.,Negative
Not worth it I expected so much more.  I gave them with an apology.,Negative
Terrible quality fell apart before even putting up. Terrible quality fell apart before even putting up. Didn’t even come with enough screws to put together and thrown in a makeshift box! I should have flushed my $$ down the toilet. Screws it came with were too small to go through the product and into a wall and the ore made hole with the screws given went right threw the shelf breaking it before it could be assembled and used. I’d rate no stars if it let me.,Negative
Fake! Not genuine sterling silver or hypoallergenic.  The earrings are very flexible like plastic and irritate my earlobes.,Negative
Cheap but beautiful This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.,Negative
Looks like a pixelated print out. Nothing like a watercolor. Disappointed,Negative
Smaller than expected Much smaller than expected. Pretty though. You can make these yourself. Not difficult to do. But for the price they are nice.,Negative
"Breathable but not a good fit The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.",Negative
... expected - does not look hand crafted - very disappointed Not as expected - does not look hand crafted - very disappointed,Negative
"Not what I ordered They are not beaded.. they are plain earrings. They are nice, but not what I bought.",Negative
The patch was smaller  on web and it didn’t stick also over charge me from what was on site. Very smaller then what was showing does not stick like it should’ve over charge for what it was worth,Negative
I sent for a refund and have yet to receive an email with directions on how to do it. The poster was way to big. I clicked on the wrong size. Wanted to return it but have yet to receive a return shipping label. Everytime I try to click claim it says error. So now I’m stuck with a poster I don’t need.,Negative
"not what I expected I only received one of the two I ordered, shipping took a very long time, and the one I received seemed smaller and cheaper than it looked online.",Negative
Not worth it The words came off within 3 days,Negative
Poor Quality check There is a smear of something on the color wrap of both pilsner coolers. It’s noticeable so I don’t know why it was shipped. I spent close to $80 on 2 Pilsner coolers. I would have expected better quality. I should have returned them.,Negative

Cheaply made just cheap product sold at big price Had I seen this at a craft show I would never expect it to be at the most 30.00. This is a major rip off. My board as unstained places which in no way is the grain of the wood. It is a board with 2 pieces of wood nailed on each end with 2 cheap handles. No idea how the initial and decoration was added. But it had no depth and appears willl easily fade with cleaning. I was planning even at the high price to give my family members each one for Christmas. Not now. Maybe my board is defective and if the seller sees and reads this and is willing to make me one that does not look like it was made by 5 year old then my mind could be changed. But for now I can only say do not waste your money. It is a high price rip off,Negative
this product is trash i was very dissapointed do not buy this product you will regret it plastic trash nothing like whats shown for discription,Negative
"Doesn’t make sense? Not a picture of the Patent.  This is misleading. Across the top, there is the words “Mickey mouse patent” in large letters, but what is behind it is just a dictionary page image of where the word “Patent” would fall.  It’s dumb. I’m disappointed and they have somehow hidden all of their reviews that aren’t 5 stars.",Negative

Cheap I bought these earnings for my husband.  They looked very nice but didn’t last long they ended up breaking in a month.

"Not the quality I expected I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46. I did contact the vendor but got no response after waiting two weeks to write this review.",Neutral

Love Wonder Woman I wanted this necklace for years! I finally bought it for myself.<br /> My biggest complaint is upon arrival it took my at least an hour to unravel the chain. There is no reason I should have to spend the amount of time getting the chain apart from itself.<br />Another huge issue is two weeks later I notice when I went to put the necklace on it seemed to be tarnished a bit on the WW piece. It had been hanging up alone and there is no reason in two weeks it should be 'tarnished' so quickly. It's sterling but I have had pieces that sit for months and months that don't need cleaned. I have fake pieces even that don't change.<br />This wasn't a 10 or 20 dollar piece. If I hadn't waited so very long for this piece and had such high hopes and didn't pay over 30 dollars for it I wouldn't be so harsh on my review. But I was so excited about this for so long to get this for myself for so many reasons and for it not to be better quality upon arrival is very disappointing.,Neutral
"Wrong date/ Very small Product is beautiful, and they did an excellent job on the font and color, but I wish it was a little bigger and the date on mine was incorrect. I have enough time to order another, but it’s a bummer that we have to order twice. Hoping for a correct one this time",Neutral

Beautiful [[VIDEOID:b42aad7b055dce09dc01974ebfc8040e]] I would’ve given five stars until I received my second batch and they were falling apart and sloppy made.

"Item is not proportionately sized for adult use. I was SO excited to receive this item. I had been looking for a while for a wood record table, which would also hold albums. I was even more ecstatic because it was handmade in the USA. I prefer to support local small businesses and products made in the USA. I didn't realize when I ordered it, the actual height and size of it would be so small and short. Honestly, I can adapt to the furniture size being small but it is ETREMELY small in height. I can sit in a regular chair, and it hits right about the same height. I did order the 12inch hairpin legs, which was my mistake. I should have gone with longer ones. In hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. However, I expect something to be advertised if both small enough to either fit in a kid's room or an adult's living room. I would have ordered accordingly. I am in search of longer hairpin legs. As it is now, I have to bend over to play an album and practically sit on the floor to search through the albums in the stand. Otherwise, quality of workmanship and woodworking were simple, classic clean lines just as I wanted.",Neutral

Good and bad The picture on each balloons came out really nice but I filled them up with the helium tank that you would buy from Walmart and the balloons didn’t float at all. I guess they were made out of a heavy material or there’s a different helium to use? They were still a hit at my daughters 21st but I which they would of floated… I was a little bummed about that. We just put tape on the back and stuck them to the walls. But great picture quality on the balloons.,Neutral

Eh I was really enjoying my case but literally three days after having it on my phone the lettering began to chip which made me realize It wouldn’t be long before it chipped off entirely. As I’m reading the comments and see that only few people have had this problem I’ll make the assumption that the manufacturers are most likely NOT consistent with their materials. So maybe they temporarily substitute products when they run out of their normal ones 🤷🏽‍♀️Idk,Neutral

"not really lavender nor cedar...but How do I describe this scent?  Obsession for men by Calvin Klein cologne.

"Very small This review is not about the quality of the item. They are beautiful and true to color. This is about value for money. Not worth it. They are very small and not the stationary I was looking for. I wanted a large page not a card. But like I said before, they are beautiful.",Neutral

"Beautiful but very difficult to read I bought the extra small tag & it is perfectly sized for my 8lb, average, long haired cat. It came beautifully packaged, no damage. They included a ring to attach to collar + 3 small rings/clips to attach tag to ring. Sorry that's so convoluted but idk the right terms for the ""rings"". The 1 star is for the difficulty reading the tag. The font is exactly what I ordered. The print is exactly what I requested. However, maybe because I ordered the shiny silver, I can't read the tag unless the lighting is perfect & I angle the tag just right. It was a miracle I got a pic that at least shows some of the words. Plus, Freya is camera shy... Or just likes to be difficult. I wish the lettering was in black on the shiny silver. That would have helped. We have many feral cats in my small town which are caught, taken to a vet, spayed or neutered, tagged & then released. Freya doesn't need all that hassle so if someone does capture her, I want them to know she's already mine. I requested that the bottom wording say ""Amy's - In/Outdoor. Perfectly done, but, as said above, difficult to read.<br />1 star for easy to read, 4 star for craftsmanship (minus 1 star only because the lack of color for words) & 5 star for lightweight.",Neutral

"Latching mechanisms have issues [[VIDEOID:dfcc56f0ca10edf48df8cae611f2abc]] The latching mechanism for the two earrings were very problematic with each one having the opposite issue.  One earring was so loose it wouldn’t lock shut and would likely fall out throughout the course of a day.  The other was so tight we couldn’t get it unlatched.  I had to get tools to bend the mechanism open and even after that it was still very tight.

". Prettier and more vibrant in person.

That may have been the intention but there seems to be unnecessary amount of space on the bottom left. Despite these issues, it really is a nice print overall and a good size.",Neutral

"smaller than it looks While it is a pretty ring and I like the idea of recycling, repurposing, etc., I was disappointed in the ring.  The band is narrower and the stone smaller than the photos implied.  Should have cost less than I paid.",Neutral
Tweety sticker It looks pretty good after I put it on but was very hard to put on. I bought two other Tweety Deca's and they were about easier to put on.,Neutral

Earring’s not so great. They were light weight. I liked their looks. I just wasn’t pleased with the craftsmanship.,Neutral
tends to bend/lean with bottles on it. This is a good product but could use more stability to it. With the bottles on it it wants to lean. I'm sure it would be great for plastic bottles but mine are glass.,Neutral

Cute but......... The ornament is cute but smaller then I expected and it was delivered with a scratch on the back of it.,Neutral
"price does not match product Cute, and great packaging but a sort of a racket - there is a simple metal ring (~$1), a piece of leather, a screw and an anchor all separate pieces you put together (simply and easily) and drill into wall. The price is a little much compared to what you are getting. Kudos on the good marketing tho!",Neutral
Three Stars Nice a little flimsy need to be careful putting up,Neutral
Not worth price There are much better and bigger spa sets that are worth the price listed. This was a smaller than expected set. Nothing extraordinary to result in the price listed. I wouldn’t have even thought this was worth half the price it is selling for. Everything was miniature. Disappointing,Neutral
Ok but could have been better Thought the workmanship would have been higher quality.,Neutral
"Very small bale, poor design The mandala itself is beautiful, however, the bale of the pendant is small and thin even though it appears larger and thicker on the photos. You will only be able to wear it on a thin chain with a small clasp ring. I had to change the ring to a larger one in order to wear on a weightier chain or cord. I was going to buy a nice bale to put on pendant in place of ring, but the hole is the size of a pencil point. I would have given 5 stars if it had a decent size bale instead of the poorly thought out design.",Neutral
"Decent Product is nice, if you’re looking for something at a nice big size this isn’t it. There aren’t any hooks or really much areas to attach a hook.",Neutral
"Three Stars Faint aroma, I had to add essential oils.",Neutral
Not bad. But not with 50$ Looks like the picture great quality...not as big as I thought it would be though....,Neutral
"Acceptable but amateur The high notes are ambiguous, lemony citrus with something else I don't particularly like. Underneath is where there is a very light pleasant musk which remained after I tried to wash it off, but it smells more like a feminine musk if I had to choose. I don't think citrus and musk go together very well. Maybe a friend will like it.",Neutral
"Good, but not great It was beautiful, but it’s very fragile and weak!",Neutral
"Okay not great I liked that these were made in the USA.  If I can find products with that label, I buy them.  But as to the design and fit of the mask, I have to say that the one that I bought from Rite Aid made in the place that makes everything actually fits better.  So I was a bit disappointed.",Neutral

Affirmation I neglected to read that it is a photo copy.  The affirmation is excellent.,Neutral
"Smaller than expected I know they listed the dimensions, but it was smaller than expected and just doesn't look right.",Neutral
Wish posts were thinner These are really cute but the posts are too thick and were hard to put in and hurt my ears when I tried them on. I compared to the posts of other earrings and they are probably triple the thickness of my other earrings. It’s too bad because otherwise they are very cute.,Neutral
"Size was smaller than before I had bought my husband one for his birthday and it was larger than most and very beautiful.  We both love it, so I wanted one for my bureau.  It came one day sooner than I expected, which was wonderful. But I was very disappointed upon opening it, as it was not as big as the first one. Nor was the quality as good. I would have gladly paid the extra $5 for the larger size.",Neutral
"Lost its shape right away, not snug enough, sharp I like the quality of the hoop, but the edges are a little sharp so it hurt to push through. Even though I twisted it the right way to insert so it didn't lose its round shape... It still lost its round shape. It's like an oval in my nose so if it twists around it looks weird. I'm going to keep it and wear it, but I wish I got a 6mm so it fit more snugly against my nose. I measured my old 18g ring that stuck out a little and it was more like 8mm, so I got the 7mm thinking it would fit snugly and I didn't wanna risk a 6 in case it was too tight. I also wish I got a 22g instead of a 20g because this seems a little thicker than I expected! But now I know. Hope this helps!",Neutral

"Will not stay looking fresh forged, but is durable enough for daily wear. Hot straight from the source, not the Amazon page, and it does in fact come as advertised, however the black stuff rubs off with wear, and the chain blackens kinda quickly. All that said, it is still a nice necklace I wear daily, and I surprisingly get complements on it and a lot of people want to know what it is. Either way, I wear it for me and it serves its purpose.",Neutral
"Wrong page It seems to be a nice product, it is a disappointment that it is not a page from the dictory that gives the definitions of ""home""",Neutral
"They're Just Okay Well, they fit, but not really well (I wear a 6 - USA). The plush looks inexpensive, and the soles are incredibly hard. The heat-able insoles work alright, but I wanted to wear them while sitting on top of my bed, and have warm, snuggly feet. But the soles are just so freakin' hard! I hadn't intended to wear them outside at all, but it appears that the manufacturer had other ideas.",Neutral
"Too thick They are a hot mask. And I was under the impression that they would stand away from my face. They do not. In winter they would be fine, but sweat inducing on a warm day<br />They do fit well",Neutral
"Very pretty but too small to be usable PROs:<br />- Nice grain to the wood<br />- Good as a decorative piece<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Spoon portion doesn't hold much volume for serving purposes<br /><br />Overall, it's a beautiful spoon that is limited in practical use.",Neutral
"Larger than I thought I really like the style and weight of these earrings, the only issue I had with them was they are bigger than I expected so the bottom of the x ends up hanging over my ear lobe. I was hoping for them to end at the bottom of it. This was the only issue I had with them. They are pretty and dainty as advertized.",Neutral
It’s ok It’s a good product for its price. The custom part is smaller then I thought and the custom writing is hard to read but it still looks nice,Neutral

"Nice but overpriced I have been giving each of my sons a new, unique and relevant Christmas ornament for over 25 years. While this serves the purpose, at $15+ each it is waaaaaaaay overpriced. It is machine cut out of a soft wood with some spray paint splashed on. The ribbon is a piece of beige yarn. Sadly disappointed.",Neutral
"I really like the design of it I bought it for my sister-in-law for Christmas, I really like the design of it. She liked it too! But the chain looks cheap for what I paid for it. Hopefully it's not a cheap chain and it doesn't break!",Neutral

"A Disappointment In Person I was excited to receive these glasses. They are somewhat cute, but in my humble opinion, the online pictures are far lovelier than the actual product.

"Caveat Emptor... Love the quote, but I didn't see that it was just an 8×10 picture.  My mistake there.",Neutral
Good product for the money The only complaint I have about this product is that it is VERY hard to latch. The chain loops are very small which makes it difficult to hook,Neutral
"Why not a $10 charm? My son requested I buy this for him, and he really likes it, except for the $100 charm. He's bummed it's not the $10 bill, since that's the bill Hamilton appears on. It is also very delicate, so be aware of that.",Neutral
Only one side engraved/finished I expected a little more quality,Neutral

Lucky me Nice just bigger than expected,Neutral
Small Small,Neutral
"Great Banner!, but the picture lacks focus. This is a great banner. I couldn't get this anywhere else. The only problem I have with this is the low quality picture they used and enlarged it. You can see the pixels on the edges of the picture and it is fuzzy. The lettering seems fine, but looks like a word creation with a copy and paste picture from the internet without AI adjustment to enlarge it or a high quality picture to prevent picture degradation when over-sized. Appreciate the fast shipping though. Thank you.",Neutral
"Good pictures, some were questionable Overall I was contempt with the product, however there were some aspects of it that was a little off. Some of the pictures were very out of place and random that I did not think followed the theme the product was trying to portray.",Neutral
Much smaller than appear in photo These are nice earrings but they are quite small.  I was not prepared for the size--maybe I did not read well.,Neutral
"Needs Hook Stopper The hook needs a stopper to keep it from coming off, especially in these times when we're having to take on and off face masks.  Otherwise, the stone is very pretty and matched my mother's necklace and bracelet.",Neutral
"Pretty but … These earrings are very pretty on, very light weight and I lived them for the 15 minutes I had them. I put them on when I got them, sat down and watched tv for a couple of hours, and when I got up, one had worked it’s way off and was lost. And that’s with me just sitting! I would reorder, because I loved the earrings, but decided not to because off it fell out of my ear when I was just sitting, I’m convinced the same thing would keep happening. It’s unfortunate they don’t stay in place because they look great on.",Neutral
"Rustic Too rustic for my taste. Pretty but it was rough,  nails were showing and I had to sand it down to prevent splinters. I still kept them because the design is very pretty.",Neutral

"Very Flimsy I really really wanted to like this item. It was packaged well, but it is so flimsy that even with great packaging it came broken in three places. I was refunded my money, I was just very dissapointed because I wanted something a little sturdier",Neutral
"Cute and useable I'm sure many people will enjoy it. For my purposes, there's wasted space and the organization should be changed: Any necessary 'meal prep' and 'notes,' shown on the front side, should be permanently placed with your recipes for future reference instead of repetitively on the then current week's menu list. The backside blocks for grocery lists would be better associated if formatted like the front side menus in full horizontal boxes just like on the front side; and, divided in three columns - breakfast, lunch & dinner. I will use these as it's nice seeing graphics instead of the usual, formal Arial (etc) font.",Neutral
"like made for a child's hand definitely not adult size These rings are tiny, like made for a child's hand definitely not adult size. Ridiculous for the price, hand crafted means imperfections...I returned mine and at least they gave me no problems with that except I had to pay the return postage.",Neutral

"Fantastic EDC pocket organizer. The materials and build quality of this particular pocket organizer are exceptional.  The brown leather is thick, durable and carries well.  The leather has worn around my tools and even holds the shape once they’re removed.  Placing them back in elicits an audible sound that I can only describe as comparable to holstering a firearm or knife into a good kydex holster.<br /><br />The materials supersede the price.  I have several of their products and will continue to be a repeat customer.  The products also arrived earlier than listed.<br /><br />***It should be noted that there’s a significant different in the thickness and quality of the brown leathers they use and the black ones.  Black leather is much thinner and doesn’t hold up as well as the thicker brown options. Sticking is also kinda loose due to the weaker leather. Attached photos show some of the differences in thickness.  There is a significant step DOWN in quality when ordering the black leather version of this product.<br /><br />5 stars for the brown version<br />2 stars for the black version",Positive

Gorgeous notebook! The recipient of the notebook absolutely loved his gift and felt its craftsmanship was excellent and that its beauty would inspire his creativity.,Positive
"Great workmanship, absolutely beautiful. Beautiful workmanship and worth every penny. Would definitely order something else.",Positive
Gets the point across in a cute way Better than I hoped. We live on a walking path and just had some trees planted. Some owners think the yard is their dog’s toilet so I wanted to get the point across without being obnoxious. It’s worked perfectly and I think it’s because they’re bright/friendly and not a crude message like so many signs. Hand painted too - each one is a little different. They’re sturdy and thick and both are holding up in the rain. Happy to recommend.,Positive
The image is as tall as the glass It was as described and makes a nice addition to my beer glasses which we use for everything but beer!,Positive

"Beautiful but delicate Everything about it is perfect except for the string; the one chosen makes the piece rather breakable, especially if using them as mala/prayer beads. On the plus side, it also makes using it as such very quiet which is useful if you meditate at times where it was best you weren't a nuisance (small spaces, late hours).. Being smaller beads, it is also a bit more classy, and less in your face than most mala beads, for if you wish to use it in public without as much judgment from others",Positive
Add a symbol option please Very cute! I do wish there was an option to pick the symbols that I wanted because I asked for a nautical symbol and got an anchor when I wanted a compass haha. Very quick service and a nice quality for the price.,Positive

Five Stars This is well made and looked beautiful on our tree,Positive
Super pretty and sparkly and love the larger size I have a big wrist and this works perfectly.  It's sooooo sparkly and pretty-- almost a little overwhelmingly.  I think I need to go smaller if I want something for every day wear.  The blue is super bright and it's lovely!,Positive
"Don’t hesitate any more! Perfect! I am so impressed with this necklace. The quality of the stone is beautiful, with a rich golden color and milky white. Good vibes too. The wiring is strong for every day use. I will def buy from this vendor again.",Positive
Yorkie Mom Tshirt Very pleased with this soft T-shirt. Good fit and well made. Great color choices!,Positive
"Really cool! Excellent cnc cuts on all of the components and it was well packaged. No damage and the custom laser work was spot on. The ONLY suggestion I would make is to offer options for the hands, out of the box it comes with black hour and minute hands, which are nice and right sized, but the sweeping second hand is fire engine red. I think offering a choice of hand designs/colors would put that last finished touch on the piece. Otherwise, great product.",Positive
Love! My mom loves these. She says the scent is a thousand times better than the store bought ones. Would definitely purchase again!,Positive
Five Stars My daughter loved it! Plan on ordering more!,Positive
"Perfect size for young ladies! I like the peridot earrings very much, they are a nice color. I bought them for my granddaughter's 7th birthday as she recently got her ears pierced.  When she opened the box she was very happy!",Positive

"Love it! I’ve been having difficulties with my tragus piercing. It wasn’t healing properly and it was hard finding they right jewelry for it. The earrings were hard to get in and they kept falling out. I think they were rejecting. Anywho, that all stopped when I got this L shaped piercing. It was easy to get in and once in it stayed in. I’ve only had it in for about a week now and my piercing is fully healed and it hasn’t come out at all. Now I only want to were this type of piercing. Hopefully I can find more just with different studs.",Positive
Five Stars Another great work. Thank you,Positive

Cannot fit all lettering on discs I truly like this product however the discs are way too small to write on.  I have a granddaughter Cheyenne and grandson Christian these name are long and you really can’t fit them in the very small disc that come with the plaque.,Positive
"Quality engraving Deep, quality engraving. Design was a bit smaller than advertised (in proportion to size of glass).<br /><br />Gets my whiskey from the bottle to my mouth, usually without spilling.",Positive
Just as descriptive Loves it,Positive
