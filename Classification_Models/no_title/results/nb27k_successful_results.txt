True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s pretty but it’s small
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is seriously crooked.  It's very apparent and for that I'm disappointed.  Had it been flush or closer to, I'd love it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The quality of the chain is fine but the arrow itself looks like it was already used and seemed oxidized. You can even see it that they both are different colors. Maybe I’ve got a copy that was returned before. I don’t know but I was disappointed

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them.

So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These earrings were super cute and I was very excited to wear them.  They fit perfectly and looked amazing.  The only problem is that after wearing them for not even 24 hours the bar broke off from the stem.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.

But it had no depth and appears willl easily fade with cleaning. I was planning even at the high price to give my family members each one for Christmas. Not now. Maybe my board is defective and if the seller sees and reads this and is willing to make me one that does not look like it was made by 5 year old then my mind could be changed. But for now I can only say do not waste your money. It is a high price rip off

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are cool but very cheaply made for the price I paid for them. Obviously they are just a pressed imprint which is still pretty cool however I got my set with only two different prints. I got 4 all the same and then 1 single. Also i chose to out mod podge ocer these so that the wood woulsnt stain so much. Cool set but really not worth what I paid .
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Earring looks pretty. You open up to put in your ear and it’s jagged, not cut smooth etc. No matter how cheap this is, it’s not worth it. Steer clear!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The idea is fantastic but……. The ring stands too tall, *way* too tall, and the prongs on the underside stone cut into my finger and actually made me bleed.  It really is beautiful and I love the idea but the design simply doesn’t work.  I can’t even recommend it for costume jewelry because it stands so tall.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It was cheap looking, no detailing and wording was thinly stamped on. Towel was not squared up and hemming was ragged!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I personalized these, keeping in mind the limited number of letters that are allowed in the edit. I did not get what I asked for. Seller did not communicate or contact me that my order could not be made even though I did not go over the letter count.  The seller should just ask for a name and age and not give false hope with false customization claims. These also appear glossy online but are just black and yellow ink on a dull matte finish.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: My necklace turned within a week with just daily wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was really hoping for more of a gold speckle look on the earrings. The gold is dull. They are definitely overpriced. I am probably going to flick gold nail polish on them to give them some life.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The design of this needle minder is very cute. However, the magnet is so weak! It barely keeps a needle on and doesn't attract my scissors and keep them on like my other minders do. Disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is good for those who don't mind the extra work, but I made the mistake of impulse purchasing, without reading and unfortunately I am stuck with a kit I have to file, sand and assemble, which is not something I'm good at and not comfortable doing. Hopefully I won't mess it up. Lesson learned! Just thought I'd share from experience.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is most definitely not surgical grade metal. The color wore off by day 4 and now my nose piercing which I’ve had for years is painful and irritated.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The item looks cool but the sound isn’t even scary. It sounds like a loud whisper with a slight screech. A co-worker told me he thought his truck had a punctured tire.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So I guess I should have assumed this was going to be a quick fix until I find another one to replace it, but oh well. This is a small “gold” hoop that will need to be “twisted” to open and again to secure it to your piercing. I’m not a huge fan since it will not ever fully seal closed. The material is very thin (20 gauge) but because it is so small it’s a bit sharp feeling if it gets slightly tugged by my hair.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Got one as a gift. Wore it one time and it came off because the velcro wasn't enough to keep it attached. Now I have to buy a new Fitbit because I lost it when it fell off
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I used there's for first and second lobe piercings and just putting them in was quite difficult considering the small size and bending them to put them in felt like they were going to snap.<br /> I had them in for about 2 days and they were extremely irritated and swollen by that point and very difficult to take out.<br />I have skin allergies but considering they're stainless steel this should not have happened. If you do not have sensitive skin or smaller lobes then this may work better for you but I would not reccomend.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s crap
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Looks like the ones advertised are the best ones. The ones I got are very light. I doubt this is silver. More like aluminum with a silver stamp. Save your money. Even the gold “vermeil” is questionable. It fades after five wears or one if you use soap. It fades. Not with the money for this clown jewelry. Totally fake looking in real life.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Muy frágiles
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are not spheres. Every picture is made to make them look like Christmas ball ornaments. They are NOT.  They are round like a tennis ball from the front and back but almost flat.<br /><br />One star for being full of garbage. Every single picture - not one shows from the side. So no one thinks they have an actual side. Dirty.

When placed in water, there was minimal fizzing and no distinctive colors emitted.  Dissolved completely in about 30 seconds.  Certainly not worth the cost.  I bought it for my 3yo son and it was more of a negative experience than if I hadn’t gotten anything at all.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The crown looks pretty decent, but parts of the print had holes and one of the crown points is tilted in toward the body of the crown. I filled these in with hot glue. I expect it will look very good once I sand and paint it though.<br /><br />Three stars since I wasn't comfortable sanding and painting outside of the box.<br /><br />EDIT: Since my review, one of the not reinforced crown points has begun to fall off. This seems to be lower quality than I initially thought.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product at all.

Just regular, casual wear and not even every day - part of my jewelry rotation of every other day or every two days or so.  It wasn't expensive but now I can't even wear something that was purchased because it had meaning for me.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful earrings!! Didn't expect the plastic earring post, but, ok....the black rose broke and fell off after just one week of wearing them! So disappointed because they're beautiful. No instructions to return if broken.  No warranty.  Sad. Felt robbed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Purchased the art unframed and had it framed as a Christmas gift.  Christmas morning when my son opened it, he immediately noticed that the author’s name was misspelled as “Ruyard Kipling” — the print is beautiful I never even noticed.  I tried to contact the shop to have this error corrected — but couldn’t get past the amazon seller assistance bot.  I requested a refund and will be looking elsewhere for a print of this poem.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I had these for quite a long time, 8mm size. Looked great, very comfortable. Had to remove them for surgery recently. They were lost so I ordered new ones. After literally countless attempts at fastening them to wear, they are all bent and the earrings never did get fastened. Didn’t have any help, so the cost of the bent up earrings is frustrating. Wouldn’t buy them again for this reason.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered this as a Mother's Day gift from hubby  The product arrived quickly, however when I placed it on my finger it looked extremely cheap. I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Completely disappointed. I ordered a 23 in a $85 wall art of a pitbull in a dark Rusty copper. For my son who is in Florida. After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.

Very disappointing!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I specifically bought this because my skin reacts poorly to anything other than gold, silver or surgical steel. I'd like to believe this is truly 14K gold filled, but my nose got inflamed and irritated after wearing it for one night. Maybe it's 14K gold filled with some kind of plating on the outside... I don't know. I've had my nose pierced for 12 years and haven't reacted to 14K gold before, so not sure what happened here. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this.

However, it Took 4 weeks for just the hat to be delievered. I ordered it 3 weeks before my sons newborn pictures expecting it to arrive well before. Causing us to have to have the photos taken without it. I’m hoping it still fits at his next photo session, but it is on the smaller side so I am not sure

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: You need to have a customize option on all your canes that it's available on. Put it in a tab before you place your order. I love the look of this cane and in the description, it tells you that you can choose from several colors and lengths. also, either brass/gold or silver hardware. But when I went to order this item, it was just going to send the 36” walnut. It becomes a huge hassle. I noticed that you had a customize option button on another one of your canes. It fit the description of the item perfectly. This cane, and many of your others say one thing but don't offer that option. ( Even though it tells you it's available.) I would just make it simple for the customer, either change the description to one stature or put that button on all of your items that have the description offered. It would ensure the customer has some choices and received the product they truly want. Also, would save you guys time on returning messages and having returned items. This means more revenue for your bottom line with less time invested to do so. I need a 37-1/2” to 38” cane. This would hurt my back to use at 36” for a prolonged period. You make a fantastic product, change this one small thing and I myself would have purchased several of your canes alone. Thank you for your time.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

Some baseball moms love to have their ta-tas do the talking, I'm not that mom. Quietly melting into the background is more my style. This shirt will have any mom being the center of attention, to be sure.  Not only will your boobies look enormous, as this cheap fabric is stretched to it's breaking point, you get the added benefit of a crop top, so when you sit on those bleachers, your entire crack will be skillfully displayed to all of the curious on-lookers in the seats above you.<br /><br />Basically. Order 3 sizes up.  Or better yet, maybe don't order at all. There are no exchanges, and no prime shipping.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the "clasp" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 "boba" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I just received my leather wallet with custom engraving. Though I like the rustic design and rather lack of finish this has a major flaw that makes it unusable. The credit cards don't fit, it's not a thickness issue as my driver's license doesn't fit either. The pockets are not wide enough which makes me think this one wasn't made properly as the one in the picture has cards in it. If I try to force the card down I'll damage it so not sure what to do wtih this wallet now but definitely back to square one and keep searching for a wallet.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This print is a horrible recreation of the original. Do not buy this.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: they were broken when i received, still haven't been able to wear
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty misleading honestly from the pictures. I thought I was getting all the colors shown, but there was just the one redwood. It is shown but I dont like it, it looks like a faded red. Its soft and okay ribbon, but I wouldnt spend $11 on it, especially when it's only 5 yards. You have to look at the details on this item and I didnt and I'm sorry I didnt. I tried to return the item before it shipped and nothing happened. I'm not gonna buy from them again but I dont put all the blame on them for me being dumb.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Was excited and can’t wait to see it. Open the package and was in shock and big disappointment, it is just a sheet with printed Justin Timberlake on it. This is not even a towel! Look very cheap too.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Really unhappy they look scratch and dull it’s just not the quality I thought I’d be getting.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is a rip-off, seriously!  I know the description states the design/text is only on one sheet of the roll and is not a "sticker" but they sure do seem like stickers to me, whether they're "heat-pressed" or not, the price is absolutely ridiculous, or "highway robbery" like my parents used to say!  Even if the seller charged a more reasonable price (like 1/2), they'd still be making quite a profit as the price of $15.00 for one roll with heat-pressed stickers is incredibly exorbitant!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: kind of dull
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not buy this. It is a one sided 8 X 10 document that is not worth the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: There is text printed over text. I had a replacement sent and still had the same problem and just returned for refund.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Arrived in a broken package so after opening the yellow mailer confetti spewed all over my living room. It also looks nothing like the photo. They are all the same mm sized pieces and none of them have a shimmer.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open. The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY! On another note: at least the driver followed instructions! Good on them!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m sorry to say it, but these are just images printed on card stock and they’re very small. I could have done this at home on my own printer.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Super cute necklace that I was excited for. But the clasp is messed up! Super disappointed<br /><br />Edit: got a replacement but once again the same use. Sadly will be returning.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Even though this bracelet is fashionable don't for one second be fooled that the stones are genuine.  So disappointed and I feel cheated and robbed.  Please... if you do purchase know it's just for fashion (1 star for that) not for spiritual or meditative uses.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: They were a pretty gold color when I got them, but after a few months, they are a dull silvery color. Maybe it’s my fault for wearing them continuously, including in the shower. They are very lightweight.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered from  Country barn babe because  all the reviews were great and all five stars. I guess I didn't have as good a luck. Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty product but it came in ripped
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Don’t waste your money
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I purchased this product unfinished and was sent a wood filled not completed product. Then was told look at the pictures on the site when asked for a return. Also said I didn’t respond in time which I did it took 2 claims for them to respond to me. For $144 you should expect something of quality not a sloped together board.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Mine looks nothing like what’s pictured. It’s just dull in the background. My name is in blue when I wanted in a pink color. I really don’t like the way it came out and it was delivered late by 6 days!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was disappointed in the quality of the leather, and the overall size of the "leaf". It was too wide for my fashion tastes, and the navy color was dull.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Poor quality
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This sucks! Letter broke, so I waited until my so. Which does this so often came home from college! His first response was where did you get this mess from! Ordered another one from a popular site they use, came out perfectly and beautiful
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Product doesn't work don't buy from co. You need to pay for return about 18.00 not worth the it.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very flimsy and light. Broke and lost a piece after 3 wears
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am disappointed at how cheap the stones look. I realize it's cultured to look like sea glass, but it's done poorly. Both the colors and the cut (much bigger, and much less dainty than the photo) are incredibly fake looking.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These were really nice and we spread them all over the tables but 15$ was WAY TO HIGH FOR LITTLE PAPER THings. Way to expensive for something you could make by yourself!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Terrible quality. Just painted onto over stained goopy wood. Sign fell apart the second we went to tap it into the ground
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The sentiment of the gift was great but the quality very poor. Broke on day 2. Would not waste the money.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: They wear slightly. But it stays put. Its a sticker... its fine.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The font  that I ordered was not what I received,  and the names are tiny.  I guess you get what you pay for. Also, the advertising shows a heart on the necklaces,  but when I tried to get one on my order, it made me take it out.  1 good thing, fast delivery.  Would not recommend.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: it came as letters with holes punched that were too small to get the string through and 3 pieces of string to rope them all through.  I could have done this myself.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Wanted this as a sweet 16 keepsake for my daughter signed by all her guests. This item felt more like a thick piece of paper coated in a layer of shiny glue. Ripped when trying to take scotch tape off that area.i wouldn't buy again for the price I paid
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It’s a photo. You have to frame it. Otherwise it’s just a piece of printed paper. Super disappointed. I guess I missed that in the description. Would not recommend unless you’re up for a craft night.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Too flimsy. Easily broken
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These wax melts are advertised as being vapor rub scented which should, in theory, help when you're congested and need a little relief. Great idea which is why I purchased them. In reality, the sent of these wax melts is so faint I can barely smell them when I stick my nose right up to the was warmer. Even then, the vapor rub smell is ineffective. I hope this vendor will work to improve the product but until such time as that happens, it's not worth purchasing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: too blurry of a picture, I think they could have improved the quality
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The sizing is off, it is way too large compared to the item description about the sizing. Also, I wrote the name and bride so that they could do the initials lettering but I was disappointed when the robe came in completely wrong. They wrote out her name and put bride in really small writing. I know that mistakes can easily be made, especially with customizations so I reached out to see if they can fix this, since this is a gift and the bride will be married in less than two weeks. They were short and rude and offered me no solutions. Don’t recommend, be careful when customizing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Blush awful color never buy again
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: 40 4x6 photo prints.  Arrives in a thin cellophane wrapper.  No box, no instructions.  If this is all you want it's fine.  Not really worth the $ if you ask me.  I had ordered for a gift and will be returning.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Don't waste your money on this.  It's very pretty, but arrived broken.  I tried to contact the seller and they never responded.  I was hoping the seller would have made it right, but I did not hear back from them.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This sign was very well-made and is on a thick piece of wood, but for some reason there was a square brown stain around the whole word “bakery” and in between the letters. It was wrapped in plastic and there was brown stain on the plastic inside. I was disappointed because I really liked the picture of the sign that I saw online. I ended up having to return it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Didn't fit even after trying with a hammer... I could have made these, rubbers ones fit much better but these would look the part if they fit... oh well...

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: While the hoop is very cute and dainty, the hoops did turn colors after a month or two. I am not satisfied with this purchase, because the “sterling silver” turned black. The sizing is great in my double helix but they quickly changed tone.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The ring lasted three whole days. It was on my finger, looked at my hand, and it was bent. I had not endured my hand or injured it in any way. Have no idea what happened. I noticed it was fitting tighter. That’s why I looked. I have ordered lots of things from Amazon, and this is the first thing I have had problems with. I was very disappointed.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not large at all. Couldn't get any smaller be hard to fit even the smallest cyclic in or any small flower. Horrible mold on the shape of it. Not a good deal for 10 bucks let alone 30. Stay away
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I did like these little studs but I was skeptical about the backs.  Turns out I had good reason, I lost the 3mm stud and back along with the 4mm stud and back two times. By some miracle I found the 4mm and back in the bathtub.  Now I have lost the back to the other 4mm stud.  The backs are little pieces of plastic that seem to loosen easily, they are clear and impossible to find.  For this reason I would not recommend to a friend.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The anchor on the anklet is not secured by the beads as depicted. So the beads slide everywhere as well as the anchor with the tiniest of movements. It was not worth the money. I suggest securing the beads so the anchor will not mobe.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I did not realize how tiny these would be! They are so small for the price! I also have a problem with them sliding back into my ear because they are so small.

We returned it because it was literally just a print on card stock... we could have done that ourselves.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cute.  Smaller than I realized (my fault).  Didn’t work well for me  —I needed a two sided sign.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Definitely not anymore breathable than a t shirt material one. Also doesn't absorb moisture, so moisture just sits on your face. Significantly stretched out within first week of wear, now hangs of the bottom of my chin. Definitely not worth the price, in my opinion.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Took 1 hour to stick it to my wall using a credit card. Very small I ordered the 18x12 thinking that atleast the race track would be big enough for my son's hotwheels to drive on but it's smaller then a hotwheel. I have spent $28 on a big Forrest decal that covers my entire  wall for a master bedroom then I spend $25.88 on this decal that took more time to get on the wall and it's small. Not worth the money and time to me and my son only played on it a total of one minute which I expected but it's just frustrating how hard it was to stick to my very flat wall that has litterally no waves or anything like that to prevent it from sticking. The look is aesthetically pleasing but other then that it's not really something I'm happy with throwing $25.88 at.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The products were cheaply made. The word family was broken. Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Fabric was a very stiff cotton and ran very small. I am usually a women’s size 4 and I could not even get the shirt on. Small is more like a child’s size 10.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the wolf handle. The cane part did not seem as advertised. I thought it would be more of a hand made ornate cane.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This product is poorly manufactured.  The backing material is stickier than the actual decal.

Not happy at all
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Loved this sign at first. However the colors do fade as other reviewers have indicated.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am going to send this necklace back to you so you can see how it broke off and you tell me whether it was worth $32 for me to keep this broken necklace after having it two months I really liked it I liked the jade piece on it, but it is very saddening to me that you can sell something that would snap off the way this did For no reason and no way did I not abuse this when I took it off, I hung it up

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The letters are very cute and this would be perfect if the vinyl wasn’t wrapped around itself in a circle when it was shipped. The clear layer was detached partly from the letters and base layer. I tried putting it under something heavy for a few days hoping it would flatten it and make it stick to the letters but no luck. We had to cut each letter, press the clear layer onto it and quickly do the transfer. Very disappointed

I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I have ordered other stickers for about the same price and received several pieces. I was quite shocked when I only received 1 sticker for the price paid. I should have read more in detail.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I have to admit that I’m NOT impressed. Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6" tall and the other 5" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to "make it work" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.  Will return.

The bottom half of the case is alright, but the top lid immediately comes off on its own. I tried to show this in the video, and as you can see, the back/top flat is too large and slides right off.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These are nicely made and the thickness is good.  However, they are VERY SMALL.  I can't imagine they would fit a man's face.  My face is not large at all and they were too narrow, even with the ear loops out as far as possible.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not comfortable to wear at all. There are SEVERAL better options for fake rings available on Amazon. Definitely skip this one. The design makes it impossible to fit correctly not to mention extremely uncomfortable. You're better off getting a permanent piercing or trying a different type of fake or temporary ring. this is just a plain ring that is damn near impossible to put on correctly and extremely uncomfortable.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Only comes with two screws and no anchors, this is not sufficient to attach it to the wall. Wood is very warped so won’t sit flush against the wall, stain was still wet so made a bit of a mess of the wall as we were trying to attach it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This shirt is super soft but the color is horrible and the fit is strange- the neck is very high cut, circling the base of the neck rather than around the bottom like a typical round neck tee. The color is mustard yellow- a bright orange/yellow that is displeasing to the eye. I read the other reviews before purchasing and knew it would be bright- but not the mustard tone. I’m really disappointed and don’t plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. I ordered Belle Mickey ears to match and the colors are nothing alike.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It has a coconut derivative in it that’s not listed in this ad for the item: cetearyl alcohol. I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is just a picture on a paper. Might say it doesnt have a frame but I clearly missed it. Never would have paid for a picture I can print off the internet.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I got these and they were going to go perfect in my son's spiderman room. I even waited a little bit to put them up because I had painted my sons room about a month prior and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause gas bubbles. So about another 3-4 weeks later I applied them. The application process was pretty straightforward and easy. They looked great on the wall. Then roughly 24hrs later, they started peeling off the wall! I tried to use the squeegee to reapply it, basically lifting the whole decal off the wall, then it started ripping as I was trying to reapply it. No matter how slow, or carefully I tried, each decal would rip in about 6+ spots. Now, 1/2 to 3/4 of each decal actually sticks to the wall and most of the bottoms are peeling off (and won't stick no matter how many times I try to get it to) and have numerous rips. Not what I was expecting at all, considering all the good reviews. Pretty disappointed, especially since these weren't cheap.<br /><br />Edit: added pictures. 1st picture showing all buildings is right after 1st time applying. Following pictures are about 24 hours later, peeling, and when gently trying to reapply they started ripping.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: We ordered 2 of these.  One came perfect, the other one showed up in 2 separate orders wells later and it didn’t have holes to put the legs into and after 2 months it developed a huge crack where the boards separated.  We don’t use it often so we didn’t notice, and now it’s too late to replace or return according to the seller.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Exactly as another reviewer said.  Looks like someone (anyone) just pulled a jpg and stretched it to print on card stock.<br /><br />This doesn't even count as a photo or a "print".<br /><br />You could do the same thing for less than $1 by sending a internet jpg to Walmart to print.  Wasteful and feels very dishonest.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: So thin you can see thru it. This would be better for ladies fashion then anything tactical. Ends where ready to split and not tied as a traditional one would be. Have used these in dessert and snow and would only use this to blow my nose.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful in the nose, but the ends are so sharp that this caused damage to my healed piercing. I had to go to a professional piercer to have it cut out of my nose because the ends do not close properly.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The chain is a very yellow gold and has no silver accents like the description states. The pendant is more of a warm gold, which doesn’t match, and looks cheap to me. I purchased this for a Birthday present and do not have time to find another gift or give the seller an opportunity to remake. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The hat came with a silver dollar sized yellow stain on the front of it, and a smaller stain on the other side.  :( it is too late to return and get a new one bc we leave tomorrow. Disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Love turquoise earrings, but after opening the box I had to look twice to make sure I was seeing them. They are tinier than tiny and inappropriate for a youngster to wear, in my opinion, without the risk of being swallowed. I could think of no useful or safe purpose for them. Packaging was nice, but going back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one. Very disappointed not even with 1 star.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Never ordering from this seller again. One of the trigger pieces is too big for the slot on the blaster and no amount of sanding could fix it. Also they do not provide specific instructions on their website, they have diagrams. It's not the same things. Save yourself the frustration and buy from somewhere else.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: WOW! AND SPENDING MORE MONEY FOR A PUFF, THAT SHOULD HAVE COME WITH THE POWDER, THAT I THREW<br />OUT.<br />SORRY I ORDER EVERYDAY AND THIS WAS NOT A GOOD BUY. PUT THAT PUFF INTO THE POWER!! THAT'S HOW YOU DO GOOD BUSINESS!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: In accurate description. Very tiny.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I wish I could give zero stars. Very disappointed. PAY ATTENTION TO THE DESCRIPTION. YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE OVER-PRICED RINGS. Picture on left is what I was expecting the stamped letters to look like. Picture on the right is what they actually look like. You can barely see it! The letters do not take up the whole space as the pictures would lead you to believe. Nor are the letters bold enough to be legible. Oh but according to the seller, they say all of this in the description: “letters so small you can only see them up close yourself”
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It's ok, I guess. I purchased another dictionary art print from another seller that is actually printed on a genuine vintage dictionary page. This one is not.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I originally bought this for my friend as a birthday gift, as we surprised him with a night out to the Lizzo concert. I was so excited, as I felt this would be a great way to remember the night.<br /><br />WRONG! The design was faulty, and the hole was too close to the top, so would not be able to hang beautifully from anything.<br /><br />After chatting with an Amazon rep, they shipped a replacement. I was expecting this to work, but nope! The second replacement had the same issue: the hole was ripped through the top, unable to hang from anything.<br /><br />Yet again, I chatted with a representative who SWORE this third time would be the charm. In case you couldn’t guess by the photo attached, the third had the same issue with the broken through hole.<br /><br />I’m SO disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: At the end of the day, it is probably my fault I am not happy with the results.  The lettering I received was not what was pictured and even though I ordered the large font it looks tiny and “delicate” on my mailbox.  I can’t read it from the car as I approach the house.  The ordering process was not clear and there isn’t a confirmation of size/color after you place the order.  In the description they offer to send you a mock up of some sort but I didn’t see that until after the product arrived.  If what you are looking for is what is pictured, be sure to contact the seller before it ships no matter what.  Otherwise you have no idea what you are getting.

I have only wore my necklace for 3 days now, and the plating is flaking and peeling off. There is hardly any on the back and the sides, and its working towards the front. I am very disappointed that this has happened so soon after very minimal wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This would have been cute had it not been for the smudged ink and uneven pattern.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is the second ring I've bought from this seller.  I now have both of Claire's wedding bands from the show Outlander and I love them both 💜  They are both very well crafted and worth every penny.<br />UPDATE 02\17\21: I have to remove some stars from this ring, after really looking at it, this was not made by hand (as in NOT well crafted) at all, it must've been stamped by a machine because 2 out of the 3 pineapples aren't fully etched in nor are the others which I believe to be a leaf and feather maybe??  Really hard to tell.  I still wear it but wouldn't pay this much if I had seen it in person.  The other one, while not really looking like Claire's ring, is still very pretty.

The black printing is so close to the color of the gray shirt that someone will have to be right up on your chest to see what it is. Also, its either an irregular cut shirt or one of those reject ones you buy from the discount stores because it is way wider and shorter than a typical size large.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The screen print was not as advertised in the picture. It is way bigger and covers almost the entire front of the shirt. The quality of the shirt isn’t great either. For how much this cost, I was expecting way more. Truly disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This plate is extremely disappointing. I bought this for my mom who is a HUGE star wars fan. The picture is extremely misleading. It looks like a chrome cover with 3D features. It's a typical flat plastic piece which was broken upon opening. Easily the worst thing I've ever purchased on amazon.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It's not AT ALL how it's was in the picture.  Completely disappointed. And 5 mins of my son wearing it, it broke. Un real...

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very disappointed with purchase. very difficult to get in contact with seller. Seller printed name incorrectly and have been attempting two get this fixed. however it say no returns/exchanges. have been trying to get in contact yet no luck. This was the sellers error not mine.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not at all what I ordered. It came small and I selected 24x30 option. It was not printed centered. Also it was supposed to be a canvas! Waste of $46. I could’ve printed this off of my computer myself.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This case is beautiful, but unfortunately isn’t good for protection.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I purchased this bag a couple of weeks ago and first I was shipped the wrong color, a replacement was shipped out only after I had to send pictures of the wrong colored bag.  The correct color arrived and I loved it until about a week into use.  The leather on the handles started to flake off, when I contracted the maker, they stated that this was vintage leather and this was common and that I could send it back to be fixed, keep in mind I have only had the bag 2 weeks!  The logo on the bag has perfect leather(shocking)!  I love supporting small business but this bag is sadly not worth the money, the design and size are great but the quality is poor.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: UPDATED TO ADD PICTURES<br />After looking at my actual prints again, I have decided to update my scathing review; however, I STILL DO NOT like the prints.  I still think the resolution is terrible and the colors are runny compared to the posted picture on Amazon. These are not what I expected; however, maybe they will work for someone else. At any rate, I left some actual pictures of what I received below, so you can be the judge.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This ring is attractive; I like the design and color; but I will not be wearing it. The sharp edges snag my clothes. And the weight of the ring forces me to remove it for comfort. I found I could only wear it for a few minutes. So sad. Another tenant for my jewelry box.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I did not receive the lights I ordered. I understand the rustic look but to have a very visible black indentation in the upper right corner on one of the sconces is unacceptable and swayed me into thinking maybe this product is no longer a good fit for my decor.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The print is cute. I ordered these for my identical twin boys that will be turning 2 soon. Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....

I contacted the seller and she basically said this is how it is. Very disappointing.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this as a gift for someone and kept good care of it in its box for a few months. After it was given, the ring started to show signs of heavy damage after only a few weeks, unlike the rest of the rings she wore. Definitely wouldn’t recommend

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: You can barely see the characters.  The moon is way bigger than Victor and Emely. Too expensive for the poorly quality.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I liked the printed sign itself. The fact it is printed on thin, cheap cardboard is a minus. The stand that you are to insert or tap to display will not withstand moisture, wind for long so I can't  display until the day of.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I would have given a great review.  The earrings are stylish and light. When I took them out to wear them yesterday the wood broke right around the post. Apparently the quality is not very good if they are going to break within 4 months. I am not hard on earrings and have earrings that I have owned 20+ years. Do not reccomend buying these
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I only gave it 1 star because I had to. For approx. $50.00 this "metal" bracelet can break into any second while wearing it.  I will be returning it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Arrived late and damaged
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not what I expected.  Not worth the price.  Unable to use this item.  Disappointed with this purchase.  I should have drawn this and printed it on my own photo paper for a lot less money.  Could have purchased 2 packs of photo printer paper for this price.  I guess if you really want to spend more money matting and framing these they would be alright, but it's not worth it to me - I'll probably just use them in a scrap book or something.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The concept for the bracelet is so cute, but the positive ends there. I thought the world be a great addition to my alex and Ani collection.<br />The fit is poor and the charms are too light weight and not of good quality.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Looks cool with the lights sitting on the shelf. Sadly, both the Jedi and Sith versions are so delicate that our home heater was slightly blowing on them and now they are tilted and warped. Too expensive. Too cheaply made. Only lasted 5-6 months.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I love the shiny brass of the tag since so many tags are all silver which made me happy to find a "gold" one. HOWEVER, I WISH the seller would include the entire alphabet in each font (upper and lower case) so that we'd be able to pick the right font when spending so much money on a specially made tag.<br /><br />Showing us examples of the fonts with 3 letter names like Max or even a longer name like Bella however those examples don't help any of us with dogs that have longer/different names or help us decide if we want the tag in all uppercase or a mix.<br /><br />I wish that the seller would either show us the entire alphabet of fonts OR make it so we'd get an actual previews of what the tag would look like in each font BEFORE ordering that way we get exactly what we want especially for these tags that cost pretty much the same as the ones in the pet stores do that actually show you exactly what you're getting.<br /><br />I would have never ordered this tag in this font if they would have shown the different fonts completely and clearly. Very disappointed with the tag but I can't return it so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />I ordered a different tag from this seller that came out beautiful so I know they have decent fonts/tags but this one is definitely a miss for me... a ~$14 mistake.

Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I received this for my birthday! I liked it so much that I wanted to gift one to a friend as well for her birthday. I went to look only to find that my box had missing items. I read some reviews that had the same issue. I’m not sure that I want to gift to someone and them not get my money’s worth.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not buy. You can not get this in. Unless you want to injure yourself and make your nose bleed, like I did. No matter how how I tried or how hard I tried to injure myself, it still won't go in. I have had a nose ring for 15 years, so I'm not new to this. I have used every type of nose ring out there. Don't buy, it's not worth it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I’m not sure if I just got too big of a size because the rest of the reviews are so good. But this thing is sharp. The two points of it dug into my skin inside and out. Every time I tried to blow my nose tissues ripped on it and got stuck.<br />I was afraid to size down too far because of getting it in, and I’m glad I didn’t cause it did take a little pressure to get it in, and it kinda hurt lol.<br />I’m returning it, it was nice quality as far as I could tell but i must be the only person who doesn’t wanna be stabbed every time there’s anything touching my nose 😂<br />Def don’t buy if you’re a sneezy person, ouchie.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It arrived horribly bent. Even though the cost was so low, I assumed it would be more substantial than it was in terms of the paper and the the foil, but oh well. Not really worth the $10 for it to arrive like this.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I can say that some of this was in me for not looking VERY closely at size, but I was a little disappointed when this arrived and it was an 8x10 photo. I was wanting something more poster size. If you look at the description closely, it does say 8x10, but I wish that there was an option to select specific size and corresponding price at check out so it would have been more obvious what size this was. Since I was searching for posters, I didn’t expect something this size to be described as a poster, but I guess its a lesson to check the details of an item very closely before you order.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I don't have a photo because I haven't purchased it yet.  After reading all the care instructions of "keep away from body lotion", "keep away from humidity", "clean after each wearing", and "store in a plastic bag", I'm turned away from buying.  I live in Florida, I wear body lotion, and I don't divide my jewelry in plastic bags.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I received this hook and didn't hate it. It was smaller than I expected. Perhaps I didn't pay attention to the dimensions... totally my fault. I wanted a hook like this for something particular but I needed it to be bigger. So after some thought, I decided to return it. When I tried to return it, suddenly I was going to get less than 50% refunded to me. Okay... I'll keep it but that really stinks when seller's do that and I'm annoyed. Won't buy from the seller again.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed -I should have read the reviews- It's printed on the equivalent of photography paper.  The design is very cute, I thought it would have been printed on masonite or some other stand alone material. Needs to be framed.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters "machine engraved". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m definitely going to be returning this.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks and feels super cheap, like $10 cheap. I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for. BUT, I had the bracelet personalized and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is UPSIDE DOWN. The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Extremely disappointed.  This is a photocopy for 10.00. Of course its my fault for not reading the description fully but it did say distressed wood sign...anyone with a printer could have done this.  I take the blame for not reading carefully.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I have other line art that is awesome. This picture is NOT. It looks so amateurish like it was drawn with a thick magic marker. So I returned it and bought the "pinky swear" art piece from another source. So happy with the new one.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Nice, but for the price I would expect better quality not just a picture on photo paper
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I kind of feel mislead by this seller, the description says it is 10" long, upon arrival found the "Real length" to be 8" with a flimsy 2" chain  extension added to the end. NOTHING in the photo's or description mentions this. Very obvious misrepresentation of what you pay for, which is also quite pricey for what you get....if it was the size advertised I would consider it a good buy, but being 2" shorter than shown I wouldn't waste your money.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: No es oro solo pintada color oro
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The bracelet itself is nice but the packaging is very generic and there is no card or written information on the stones. It would have been nice if that could have been included, or at least something downloadable so I could print it out myself.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Item was loose in the packaging, names were smaller than I thought they would be.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: As I went to put on this brand new necklace, the clasp broke entirely off the chain. It is pretty, but to break so soon is disappointing.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I thought that it had  adhesive backing
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is suppose to be a natural stone bracelet. I gifted this to my husband Christmas morning, by the evening he said hunny this may be too tight, due to the color on his wrist. My daughter then put it on and the same thing happened to her. A natural stone is not dyed. This is false description if the item being sold.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: CardStock print for $10.00.  overpriced for poor quality - sending back
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The only plus is the it came fully assembled.  Table is VERY unstable and tips easily.  Be careful what you place on it because it may tip.  Also, the nail holes are visible ALL OVER the table - they didn't even attempt to cover or paint over them, so it looks very poorly put together.  After I received it, I went back and looked at the pictures online and those also showed all of the nail holes. I wish I had looked more closely at the pictures and reviews before buying  ALOT of money for something so poorly put together.  Will not buy from this seller again.  I'm afraid I'm stuck with it after reading other reviews.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The bracelet has no purple color of amethyst at all.  A cheap looking silver dangling clasp which is not displayed  with thread showing through  appears to be holding these so called real stones together. Very disappointing and will return. Just received 10 minutes ago.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Don’t buy the organizer you can get it for $2.40 from amazon. I thought the organizer they are selling was big enough to go the width of the bag so I bought it. I should have read the details a little better. It (the organizer) is REALLY small, books will not fit in it. (Especially not any of my nursing books!) When I got the bag the monogram already had a couple pulls in the thread in my first initial, not super noticeable, I just hope it doesn’t unravel. Personally just not what I was hoping for to use during nursing school.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I received an empty envelope so I applied for a refund but they wanted me to return the product. I told them I didn't receive anything so they sent me the replacement and have now charged me twice. It was a great card but not that great.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: We bought this custom made for my daughter's wedding back in April. I checked it when it arrived and it everything looked fine. The day before the wedding, we took it out of the packaging to have it ready for the wedding cake and the heart that hangs from the fishing pole had broken off at the fishing pole. We had kept it in the packaging that it had been shipped in and were gentle with it. It's absolutely adorable, but the material is not the best quality and is very fragile and frankly flimsy! If time wasn't of the essence and if it wasn't for such an important occasion I would say go for it, but if a friend asked me about the product I would tell them not to take the chance!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These were perfect and cute for about 4 hrs, until I decided to just change my shirt. Immediately got caught on the earring, ripped it out of my ear and bent the earring beyond the point of being able to bend it back into shape. Complete waste of money.

I'm so dissapointed, I was looking forward to this ring because the design and supposed stone is gorgeous.  There's no way it is a real stone, feels like plastic, and the metal feels cheap. Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon. But then I go to ship ot and it was going to be over $190 for this $25 fake ring can be shipped back to India. Buyer be warned ⚠️!! Such a horrible experience.

On the 27th, we put in a request to the company to refund/exchange and they denied it saying it was past the 30 day.  ITS A CHRISTMAS GIFT!  I am extremely disappointed that they denied it. The clincher is that I can’t even contact the company!!  All in all cute shirts, but I have no patience with poor customer service and no way to contact a company with questions.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I knew what I was getting on quality. What I did not realize, and now do somewhat by looking at item more online, is that there is a faint design on the photo paper that makes the background look dirty. I actually tried to wipe it off! It does not compliment the other design elements on the print. I don't even think I could display. Impulse purchase that I regret.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I specifically asked if my remarkable 2 would fit in the case with the cover on.  they assured me it would, you can check the questions.  I eagerly awaited my order only to find that it doesn't actually fit, the case doesn't even come close to latching with the cover on.  I am disappointed in the inaccurate info I received and the return process has proven difficult thus far.  Sad,  a great quality product that is useless isn't really a great product.<br /><br />Anyone that has a remarkable 2 knows you don't want to store it in anything without the remarkable protective cover attached.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered this for my daughter for christmas later to find out it is completely FAKE. Instead of Peridot like the product says. It’s acctually made out of glass. So beware before perchasing that it is FAKE
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this as a gift, fortunately it came early. One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan, so I was very excited to see this shirt.  I bought it immediately. My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Overall this is a beautiful necklace,  but whoever did the work kinda did there own thing.  They did not use the font I choose and they did it in caps lock, which I purposely type out everything in lower case. It also was smaller than I was expecting. It’s a gift for my best friend, so I’m sure she will like it either way, but I was disappointed and bummed that it wasn’t how I ordered it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Don't buy!  Cheap and too small!  The size of quarters and only one sided.  These are a perfect example of only-for-sale on the internet because NO ONE would buy them in person.  Too crappy to even go through the process of returning- just straight to the trash.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not sure what I was expecting here, but as this year has taught all of us; Expect the unexpected. The quality is fairly poor and not even centered on what appears to be foam board. Great idea but bot so great delivery.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Made the mistake of unpackaging in the car- both the driver & I immediately had to unroll our windows. The smell was super toxic.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Sent me a thin strip of paper scrap leather with laser cuts in it claiming it is premium leather and will last a long time... The laser etching alone was too deep for how thin the strap was. The strap is so thin that you cannot wear it with a watch and look normal. I will post pictures. When I requested a return the seller says I have to pay for shipping. I haven't used this thing and I am having to pay 10% to return this defective item? It is roughly half the thickness shown in the pictures. Maybe even less. They claim 3oz of leather and you end up getting... 4.8 grams. I cannot even make this up. This is so clearly a rip off.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this hoop for my second hole in my nose it was very hard to put in when I did get it in it didn’t look right with the one I bought at the tattoo shop which is 14k gold hoop took it out and used it for one of my earring holes not really amazed by this one tho it’s very tiny especially if you have nails it won’t work I used tweezers lol

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Unfortunately, the photo of the model wearing this was deceptive to me. When it arrived, it was MUCH larger than it looked in the photo, and I sent it back. Great design, though -- just too large for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Seriously clearly fake and print is huge. Too big for my taste. Do not purchase. Can’t return.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I sent it back.  This &#34;sign&#34; is thick printer paper. For this price I at least expected cardboard.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not impressed with the gaps in the wood and the flatness of the top. You can’t set things flat as boards are different heights.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The fabric and monogram were fine but the apron was more than three inches narrower than it should have been  - less than 19” and supposed to be 22”. Additionally, the loop for the head was too small to make it over the child’s head! The second apron (not pictured) had a loop for a gigantic head and it was also narrower than they said it would be. Sent them both back and because it was faulty, Amazon credited my account. Would be afraid to order anything else from the company that made them!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Great quality and amazing design however the measurements were 8x10 instead of 11x14
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I purchased these in the rose gold color as a gift for my friends for our upcoming Vegas girls weekend. The wording is so light that in normal lighting you can’t even see whose cup is whose. Unfortunately I was not granted the opportunity to exchange it for ones with more contrast. The rose gold tone was a complete fail, and sadly the shop owner knew that as she stated in an email to me that the contrast is very light in the rose gold color.  It would have been nice knowing that before I spent that much money. Perhaps add that to the description. Lesson learned. Other than that they would be very cute in another color.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Runs really small. 3x fits like a large.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: When the photo backdrop poster was taken out of the shipping box there were permanent creases in the poster. We followed the process for clueing the poster to foamboard. These ceases would not come out nor allow the poster to lay flat. The picture frame cutout shown in the attached photo will show these creases. We could not send the item back due to us using the backdrop for an event that weekend.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I received this on Saturday and on Monday, I got it ready for work. Wallet, some pens, a small notebook and my phone. Wore it to work. Received nice comments on it. Repeated on Wednesday.<br /><br />Thursday morning, after approximately having used the bag very lightly for 16 total hours, most of that sitting on a desk, I go to leave the house with it and notice 3 puncture holes on the front. I panic at perceieved damage before realizing the buckle has come off. I look everywhere but can't find it. Depressed because a bag I like lacks quality, I file for a return.<br /><br />I get into the car and find the buckle on the floor. It was apparently held on by 3 very small prongs, which are now just slightly open, meaning it fell off from shifting and wasn't due to handling. I consider fixing it, but after re-examining the bag, there is no way to get up against the area where the prongs will go to reseat them from the inside.<br /><br />Then it makes me wonder what will happen if I put actual weight in the bag. Right now, it is super stiff, so even full, there wouldn't be much pressure exuded on the straps, but when it begins to loosen and become slack, those little tiny prongs aren't going to hold things safely closed.<br /><br />I was really wanting to like this bag. I have had it on my list for ages...blah.<br /><br />By the way, a 15.6" laptop barely fits, and with a sleeve, there is basically no way to close the flap, hence my using it as a purse. On top of that, it is so stiff, and has very little lining, that one would probably not feel comfortable without a padded sleeve.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The size was right but the good side had the sticky glue so unless you are putting it under glass it is useless<br />However I sent an email and was promptly refunded for the purchase
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered these in late September as a holiday gift. They appeared fine in the clear plastic box. But when the earrings were taken out, I found the setting did not seem to fit the stones well. There are gaps between the stone and its silver setting in places, and one of the earrings has a small bend in the setting at about 10 o'clock as seen in the first photo.  I clicked on return, and then return to seller, but received an automatic notice that the return period has expired.  I was hoping to avoid holiday rush backlog by ordering early.  The stone is nice although heavier and the profile is higher than expected. But the silver setting is poorly formed, at least in my opinion.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty but WAY too small consirding I was asking for a “large” heart and it kept popping up on “on my list”
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was so excited for this product and knew as soon as it was delivered that I had made a huge mistake, not worth the price and the smallest of my stones was under 15mm. I have tiny hands so this reference picture doesn’t even properly demonstrate just how small these are. Unfortunately they’re gorgeous and I just can’t let them go, but if I do regret buying them
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: When I first received the Beanie, it did not look like it would keep you warm. As a matter of precaution, I hand-washed the Beanie to remove any harmful chemicals that might be coating this product. I put the Beanie on and it barely fit my head. Then when I wore it on a cold day, the wind went right through the loose weave on the Beanie. I'm severely disappointed with this product and would warn people about these issues.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It's one thing to be handmade. It's another to just be sloppy. These were an embarrassment to give to my husband for our anniversary. Luckily he's a great guy and just laughed it off, but what a disappointment. The monogram isn't even close to being centered and both the money clip and tie clip are bent out of shape a little, so the don't line up

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Card is about half the size of a typical bitprthday card.  Also, the card says”They Say Its Your Birthday”, on the outside and nothing on the inside.  Its really a note card, not a birthday card.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Kept the pits perfumed and odorized for a max two hours before fading; and this occurred 24/7. Not to mention the something-wood scent was not even strong and satisfying.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so disappointed in this item.  It was definitely not worth $18.00.  It looks like I picked it up at a dollar store.  The monogram is very small and the ink is faint.  Even the card stock is on the thin side.  I would not purchase this item again and will probably return it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The cords are waxed and cannot be adjusted. The attached prettys are junk.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are quite small rings. I wouldn't recommend for your nostril. I bought these because I have one nostril pierced and I'm toying with getting the other one pierced too. These are too small to reach to the same height on my nose that my other piercing sits at. They are very pliable but it doesn't work for me.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This product was poor quality and not as described.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: There are ZERO 4 or 5 star reviews, see for yourself click on one......From the looks of the mask on Amazon the squirrel appears to be sewn or embroidered in....it’s not. It’s a small squirrel iron on patch that’s been ironed onto a cheap flat fabric mask.  The squirrel s already coming unglued on the outside. Mask has no nose clip and no contoured chin. There is no filter pocket either. The mask is NOT adjustable at the ears so whatever the fit is it’s the best you’re going to get.... pretty sad really In my opinion it’s not worth the $14.95 total including shipping<br />Side note, there are no 5 or 4 star reviews, yet they show the 5 star at 55%....something isn’t right about that

All that waiting time and money for me to flatten it out myself or pay more for someone else to do it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are great quality.  But it's obviously for NOT for anyone with medium or large wrists. I was fooled by the pictures.  I thought the bracelets were thicker and just more substantial than what they actually are. Measure your wrists before purchase, and don't expect the bracelets to be like the pic.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Nope. The word handmade is very misleading. This is a literal photocopy of something that someone may have made. It's is printed on photo paper.

VERY disappointed and will not be ordering anything from this company again.  If this stuff is what I ordered, it's horrible, if the company cannot process orders correctly, that's also horrible.  Avoid at all costs unless you want to look like a greaser from the 50s.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was very dissatisfied! Poor Quality ring base. Stone looked to be manufactured. The inclusions were more like plastic chips then organic debris. The stone was loose in the setting. Being a third party the normally straight forward Amazon return policy does not apply.<br />The seller accepted the return of sent to Istanbul Turkey at my expense. This would have cost me more than half the price of the Ring itself. I saw this stipulation nowhere in the ad for this item.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: What a disappointment. There is a very slight hint of honeysuckle which dissipates the moment you put the powder on. The packaging is a disaster as the minute you take the top off, powder goes everywhere (and it has an unpleasant chalky feel). Lastly, it doesn't absorb moisture which is the main purpose of dusting powder.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This sheath is very well made.  Looks very good and the inclusion of the belt loop is nice.  The biggest problem with this sheath is how tight it is.  I’m talking dangerously tight.  I put my BK9 in and it took everything I had to get it out.  A very dangerous situation for yourself and anyone around.  The price is reasonable for what you get, but at that price range you’d expect a better fit for your knives.  I’m sure there’s a way to reheat it and get a better fit but for a custom made sheath it’s too dangerous as is.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Looks NOTHING like the photo.  The "stamped" letter isbarely legible, not the dark inked stamp like in the photo. The horse charm and birthstone are nice, the chain is not the best of quality. I purchased for an 8 year old but was expecting it to be a little nicer.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I LOVE these hoops. I use them for my first and second piercings. They are so comfortable I’ve left them in for nearly a month at a time. I forget they’re there. And they’re absolutely adorable!<br />The only thing I don’t like is that the silver literally turned BLACK. This could have just been a fluke in the one earring because it only occurred in the one earring. I will be ordering a new set to see if this happens again. Will update in a few months!<br /><br />UPDATE: The new ones also turned black after a few weeks! Save your money and just don't buy these! I am returning the new ones and wont be buying again. They are cheap quality

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I loved these when they first arrived, but after just two weeks of wear, they were so badly tarnished that a silver polish cloth wouldn't remove the tarnish. When I contacted the seller, she recommended cleaning them every time I wear them and keeping them in a sealed plastic bag when I wasn't wearing them, but the tarnish is so bad they're unwearable. Though I'd asked for a refund or replacement, she ignored those questions. Buyer beware.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The Name beads fell off and the Names on Beads rubbed off within 2 Days. The clasp doesn't stay closed, so my Husband stopped wearing it because he would lose it due to falling (clasp doesn't hold) off several times a Day

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The ball and opal already fell off.  Offer only about a week. It still has one left but that isn’t why I purchased it. And it doesn’t close properly hence why they fell off to begin with which pinches the inside of your nose constantly.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I truly wouldn’t waste ur money like I did. Maybe I mis read the reviews but I thought this was supposed to be a poster like quality or on canvas. It’s literally a piece of paper that I could have printed at home on glossy paper. I was so disappointed to give this as a gift. Thankfully she loved it anyway because I thought of her so there’s that.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Great design but was surprised when I received them that they were just printed on a slightly higher gauge of paper than what you use in your printer day today.  Would suggest a more sunstantial/stiffer material to resemble more what is placed on the doors at hotels.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: EDIT: As pretty as it is, the rug sadly does not last long. After 3 weeks of continued use, the name has almost completely faded. Would NOT recommend.<br /><br />It would've been nice to know if the "s" at the end needs to be added when customizing or if it gets automatically added when being made. Apparently it needs to be added when customizing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Disappointed. Ordered for a gift and was not going to open the package but am glad I did. The knot is visible and and too big to hide inside a bead. Not sure yet if I will try to cover the knot with a bead or send it back. Also, there is very little color variation in the tiger's eye so this is about 90% black (boring).
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Turned dark within a week of wear, not sure if it's silver. My ears did not have a positive reaction
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s cute but not quite what I was expecting. Over priced for just being words printed on card stock with no frame. I had to purchase a frame separately. I realized after receiving it that it doesn’t come with one but the picture advertised shows it in a frame.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was pretty disappointed in these when I got them! The look of them is very vintage, but in the description it makes it sound like they are printed on a type of paper that will have that vintage feel to them but instead they came printed on glossy photo paper... kinda ruins the whole vintage/old look I was going for. Very misleading when they call it “Archive paper”.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought from this selling in good faith but when I got the peace I didn’t feel an energy. So I contacted someone who researches stones and she did some research on the company first and then she checked my stone out. She told me from everything she had seen with the website my moldavite was not real, then I gave her the stone and she confirmed it. I tried contacted seller for a refund and have been ghosted. I should have gone with my gut on this and did some more research. Don’t waste your money
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It looks like any other mask but it does have a larger chin area.  I don't see how some with a thick beard could benefit from this.  My husband has a goatee and he found the mask uncomfortable even though I ordered a large size.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered my regular size but they are WAY too big. The thong/strap is rough and felt like it may produce a blister if worn too long. Too bad for me, the seller refuses to refund my money since each pair is ‘custom’ created. Which means they snapped the cheap ‘jewel’ onto the middle of the thong.<br />Don’t buy from this seller!!! If you end up not liking your purchase, too bad, they keep your money!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The cards are smaller than the images led on, and most of them say the same thing. There are only a few different sayings but only 1 copy of those.<br />For $10 I would say it’s a decent buy, but definitely not any more than that.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This pair arrived in an plastic bag that was old and what appeared contained smalls holes all over as if chewed by something  and missing on one earring was the actual hook that goes through your ear. I ordered several pairs from this seller. Whereas the design part of the earrings are lovely, they are very simply made & poor craftsmanship. Several sets arrived with the pieces separated & required me to assemble them & tighten sections with needle nose pliers!? They are extremely lightweight as advertised which actually is nice. However there absolutely needs to be better quality assembly required on the sellers end. As is they are definitely not worth upwards of $20 by any means.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I'm sorry to give a bad review, but unfortunately this product wasn't good quality. The wood box was cheap with a loose hinge, and the paint was acrylic with no sealant or buff coat.

But I think there's definite artist potential with better materials and a protective coating!

What I received in this order is NOTHING like the ones my friend showed me, but about the same price. I didn't expect much for the price, but I can not say enough about what garbage these things are, especially compared to the ones I was trying to match. The pictures will say enough.<br /><br />First, where are the backings?!<br /><br />Second, the bezels are not &#34;rose gold&#34;, as far as I can tell, not even a &#34;rose gold&#34; plate. Maybe some kind of paint or stain?<br /><br />One of the center pieces has a chip out of it and one of them has the center piece set so far off center, you can see it from several feet away which is made even more obvious because the centers are too small for the bezels. (Same as the other pair I bought.) There's also corrosion of some kind on one of the center pieces.<br /><br />Finally, there's no way I would want my friend to actually put these things through her skin. The posts are NASTY. They've already got some kind of corrosion on them and they're not smooth. (Also like the other pair I bought.)<br /><br />I don't know if these are really &#34;handmade&#34; or not, but they look like something bought for 10 cents each in a bag of 1000 from China.<br /><br />(I bought a second pair in another color and it suffered every one of the same problems plus some.) Now I have to waste my time sending them back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Made it to me I time but Didn’t really work as<br />I expected it to will not order it again
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This item was grossly overpriced.  It was simply a cheap looking photo copy, not a quality print. In addition, song lyrics were incorrect.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Fine and functional.. necklace strand barely goes around my wrist, much less my neck, and to cut it would damage the flimsy loop that connects to the pendant.. returning with regret
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am very disappointed with this necklace.  I gave it to my wife for Valentine's Day and she wore it one time and the chain turned black in sections.  Very embarrassing.  The charm also faded from its original shiny colors.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I needed these for an important project and was excited when they arrived (one day late) - but they don't stick!  They are all dried out.  Because I don't have time to return them as I need this project to get done, I had to use what I could by taping the dots on.  This is ugly and wasn't why I bought these!  I'm very disappointed in this product.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: [[VIDEOID:7e0dc8d407ebabbabe1974da03181572]] Package came and I opened it and it looks like this. I hope it is better then it looks. It looks like it was used and repackaged.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not good!<br />Fits small. The real jackets does look the same as the one in the picture.<br />Looks cheap.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very cute! They seem extremely breakable.  I'm not sure if one roll is supposed to be bigger than the other but it bothers me...<br /><br />*Updated. One of the earrings broke after about 10 uses.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Didn't like them at all. There was almost no scent of Patchouli, they were a waste of money. I wouldn't give them any stars, but it wouldn't let me comment unless there was atleast one star.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Color is too bright, reminds me of the  sail cover for a boat.  The fitting is too lose, making wrinkles. Returning this purchase.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Engraving is blurry/smudged. Looks very cheap.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was disappointed with the shirt. I ordered a purple shirt. When I got it, they had used black letters on a dark shirt. The letters actually looked like iron on letters. I don't understand why light letters aren't used on dark colored shirts. I had to buy fabric paint so that the words can be seen.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Metal started bending and disfiguring after short time of gentle wear. Wouldn't buy again.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Super cute ring but did not fit was way to small I would go up a size if you are buying this
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty and innovative but not asubstantial piece of jewelry.  Small and lightweight.  Looks like it could easily break.  I returned it.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The metal piece is poor quality and very sharp. It cut my infant son as my husband was wearing it. The company was not responsive to my messages. I would not recommend this product or this company by any means.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: it was worn for two weeks and it already tarnish. very upsetting
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The hook is the perfect size,  color and style that I wanted.  They seem sturdy. I went to hang it today and found out that the holes in the hook are too small for the black screws that were provided. I went to the hardware store and couldn't find any small enough in black. Now I'll need to find some black paint to put on the top of the screw after I install it. Makes my cost higher and a simple project take longer,  which is frustrating.  FYI - #4 × 3/4 is the size of wood screw that fit my hooks. I could have ordered a package of 100 from Amazon in the black that I needed but didn't want to spend that $11 for the amount of screws I needed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I make jewelry for fun. It looks more polished than this particular bracelet
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It was an alright purchase. U was a little disappointed in how faded the print was. It looked more vibrant online. It also looked like an iron on vinyl I could of made it at home.  I guess you get what you pay for.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is exactly what you see, in plastic on a flimsy piece of nylon string. The weight of the pendant isn’t enough to straighten out the cord. I’m really disappointed.<br /><br />I returned it and got some thing better at a lower price.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am extremely disappointed in my order. I ordered 3 stackable rings and the names are not even legible!! The stones look like they are not set well and will fall out. This was for a gift, I wish it had come in a ring box instead of a plastic bag.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Marketed as turquoise but when I received both pair, they are more of a green stone, not so much turquoise.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: They broke . Did wear but once and they broke!!!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed in this. For the price is Looks like it was rushed. Smudged paint and marks all over the wood.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Significant problem with this order was that there was NO packing slip with details about order and NOTHING about the seller. I suspect this was deliberate.<br />Took ages to get permission for return. Very secretive seller.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Bought them for our 10 year wedding anniversary and they are what I expected, very disappointed. You can’t see the writing on the glasses.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The angel wing was broken off when I opened it to look at it and then the small blue bead kept falling off because it wasn't secured on a ring. I cannot return it in time to replace it because I need in in 5 days.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Product looked great, packaged great. Arrived with a broken frame and I sent 2 messages to the seller within 4 business days. No reply. Filed a claim with Amazon to request a refund since the seller couldn't reply. Only needed a new frame. Thankfully Amazon resolved, but my loved one is still out the gift that was for mother's day.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Edit:<br />I discovered the finish on the links wears off which gave me a rash on my wrist. I cannot return the band due to it being six days past the Amazon return window. I am so disappointed and also out $30, which is a large sum for a retiree.<br /><br />I love my new silver Fitbit bracelet. It is stylish and comfortable to wear. I like using the clasp much better than the buckle on the plain black band that came with my Fitbit.<br /><br />I did not find that attaching the bracelet to my Fitbit was overly complicated. Plus the seller sent extra pins in case of loss. Also, there were additional links to make the bracelet larger.<br /><br />I love my new bracelet, and I am glad I spent the bucks to buy it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Im pretty dissapointed in this product. Not as the product description descrined. The small stones in the head of the stem are literally plastic beads. Tou can actually see the thread holes through the sides. The weight is terribly out of proportion. I wouldnt habe bought this if i had known what low quality this was going to be. Am definitely going to try and send back for a refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture of the Rose Quartz ‘leather chain’ pendant was a lovely pink, and even though the product info indicated that the quartz you receive will not look exactly like the picture, I expected the ‘rose’ color to be beautifully apparent.  Instead, the pink on the quartz chrystal appeared white.  The leather chord from which the chrystal is suspended looks very cheap.  For some, the weight of the fairly large chrystal may be uncomfortable.  I would give the product ‘no stars,’ but the “submit” wouldn’t work if I didn’t.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The description now says not a tin sign, but this item is clearly SEO'd to come up when you search tin signs because that's how I found it. My bad. Not worth $12 for a piece of paper.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The print of dog paws with names is absolutely the best idea, so sweet. The tshirt quality is terrible, thin, and cheap. If the shirt material was quality it would be a perfect 10. I'm afraid to wash it because I am sure it will shrink and fall apart.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Don’t like how it feels.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This piece is not as pretty as the picture.  It reminds me of something an old woman would have.  It is a nice size, but just nothing special about it.  Nothing like the beauty of the photo.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It does smell decent! But the package comes without any direction of how much to use or the ingredients inside. I did try it, using like I do my other bath salts and there was zero fizzing. It also had a hard time dissolving. It kind of sat there lumpy until I mushed it around. Turned the water a murky color. I thought it was lame so I added more water and bubble bath and I had no bubbles which usually work fine. It's like it sucked all the joy from my bath. I wouldn't buy this or give to a friend.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: A little disappointed. I think I’ve had this product for 5 months, and out of nowhere the latch broke on it and I had to Toss it.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought 2 of these because I really liked the colors and the look.  Within 1 minute of wearing the first one it broke and can not be fixed.  I haven't even tried to wear the 2nd one because I fear they will both break.  Don't Waste Your Money!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered a purple bracelet like the picture above for my husband, it was suppose to match his watch. I received a light violet almost see through color. I'm disappointed!!!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered a “E” . I personally thought it was pretty but everyone else I showed says it doesn’t look like a E. It’s been 9 months since I bought it and it’s still not on the wall since I have no clue how to properly/ safely hang it over my baby’s crib without putting nails it through and nail holes in the pink wood letter .

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was super excited to get a custom shirt.  Super soft!  But didn’t even get through one day of wearing and the material started to peel/fray.  The letters look great.  But I feel maybe I should just frame it and make it a decoration near my workout area instead.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was so disappointed with the washed out color.  I saw the nice green color online and thought I would receive the same. To my dismay, the earring color was a light washed out green.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The shirt and graphic quality are good, but beware that you don’t get to choose the color of the balloon dog.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I’m not sure why this is even a thing. It doesn’t break down buildup. It has a color so it’s making you believe it worked or works and it really ain’t doing anything
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I am very disappointed by this product. The letters are not as neat as they pictures show. My daughters name starts with a M and the M has thick mountains which make it look very cheap. I am upset with myself for spending this much money on this.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was denied a return on this bracelet. Reason given…”Resized or altered jewelry cannot be returned.” I assume the symbol I selected to be embossed on underside of bracelet is considered an alteration. However, you have to choose a symbol or word to have embossed before you can place the order. Do not order if you think there is any reason you may want to return it!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Comfortable and fit great but the letters are falling off after one use.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I received this as part of a gift box in August.  Loved it so much I ordered just this salt scrub.  It is NOT the same as what I received in the gift box. This salt scrub smells horrible and left my hands feeling sticky.  Not happy…especially for the price I paid.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: MAKE SURE YOU READ DESCRIPTION. The order DOES NOT match the pictures of the product so don’t base yourself off of that. This product is NOT FRAMED. You literally get PAPER PICTURES. Paid 45$ for PAPER PICTURES. DO NOT ORDER. Not to mention they don’t accept returns because they are “customs” yet you don’t have a choice to choose out of different pictures so I don’t see what’s custom about it. Hilarious. I hope you go out of business since you like to just rip people off. :) PS you should think about putting a realistic picture of the product... oh wait you can’t cause no one in their right mind would buy. Lesson learned
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Item was very small and very thin. I appreciated the item was wrapped in a simple drawstring bag-which is sufficient for shipping. It is not useful for much more. But, it eliminates one extra plastic bag

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very hard to separate the paper to stick the images on the wall
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: There's no way to verify the saying is printed on "original" paper. The product for framing, is paper thin! The print against the background only distracts the eye from the mesage.  I do not recommend.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is a cheap (and I mean cheap) drug store photo print. There is nothing "handcrafted" about it, and by made in the USA they clearly mean went to the closest walmart to get a quit print out done. It's not even on quality paper.<br /><br />Avoid the hassle and purchase a decent product from a decent seller.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The made is ggood but the big stone in center looks like plastic and is a very big ring as a whole..if you are in USA please be careful to order anything from there bcaz if u wana return any thing you will have to pay shipping lot more than cost of the item and run around of the seller

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I hope the maker of these decals is working on an easier way to adhere them to a wall because I can't imagine they get many repeat customers. The designs are beautiful, but the process might have you second guessing your decision. The process takes days: 1. flatten decal for 24 hours 2. Apply decal to wall and let adhere for 24 hours 3. SLOWLY and CAREFULLY remove backing w/out ruining decal: at least 1 hour. It looks good, but it was rough-going several times. Review update: after all that effort, the decal is bubbling up and not sticking in some spots. I removed a star as a result. Buyer beware.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It fell off and was list the first time I wore it. But right up until then I loved it. I just had it on a thin blouse, so nothing was tugging. Must be a tad heavy for the magnet. I had ordered another design, but now I am too afraid to wear it.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I wanted to love these so bad. But I just couldn’t. They seem very cheaply made. Even when you open and close them then way the seller says to, they still bend and contort/disfigure the round shape. And then you can’t get it back to a circle shape again. And the ends of mine came tarnished. Just very unhappy with the product. Will be returning these sadly.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Bought two cat dishtowels and loved them.  I should have noticed the dimensions on this one.  It is huge.  Also, the screen printing is in the center section of the towel.  This makes it impossible to hang and see the design.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Sadly, this did have potential...if what had been sent looked remotely like the photos. Unfortunately, the 3D printing quality on the one I received was disturbingly pitiful. I ended-up getting the same type/look item from a different seller that actually took care and had proper quality control on what they allowed to be shipped to customers. I did attempt to reach out and did not receive a response. It is what it is and this went in the charity donation bin.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this nose ring almost 2 months ago but have only been wearing it for a few weeks. It caused a nasty infection in my nose for a couple weeks even though I cleaned the nose ring with alcohol and used clean hands when putting it in.

When you place a stretchy bracelet on, it should move comfortably around and up and down the arm. No mark's should be left when trying it on and wearing for 5-7 minutes.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the necklace, the way it turned out and the way it looked. I ordered in late February, It came by early March.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I’m hoping it holds up. It seems cheaply made for the price. I hope it is natural amethyst but honestly it doesn’t look it. It is large for a woman’s wrist, even on the tightest clasp it is very loose. Packaging was very cheap as you can see. So if you intend it for a gift, plan on buying a separate box to give it in.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Prepped my walls and had a fairly easy time sticking them on.. It looked awesome - then an hour later I come back into the room and see every last one of the stickers peeling off.. I stick them back on - several more times throughout the next hour.. They refuse to stay on : ( I end up pulling them down and asking for a refund.. I don't receive a full refund and am out $10 of the $65 I paid.. Not happy..
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Quality is fine. I was hoping the gradient would be 90° from where it was actually printed. Makes this product unusable for my project. :(

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: So, I really love the styling of this ring.  And I was really excited to wear it, as the majority of the jewelry I wear on the daily is Sterling Silver. Real, 925 stamped, Sterling Silver.  This is not 925 sterling silver and should not be advertised as “sterling silver.”  It should be advertised as just a silver colored metal ring.  As you can see in the photo, the ring tarnished after wearing it one day. And, you can see that I am also wearing a Pandora bracelet, which I rarely take off.  I have never reacted to the Pandora bracelet or any other Sterling Silver jewelry that I wear daily.  The ring is very lightweight, which wasn’t a huge dealbreaker for me.  But false advertisement is a dealbreaker for me.  It’s really too bad, because it is a cute ring.  I’d have purchased more of these as gifts for friends. This was a first and last purchase for me.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Great idea, wanted to like it, but it doesn't look as it does in person. The lips and mouth look huge, so it doesn't look right. Almost like something you would wear for Halloween since the lips and smile don't look natural, and are overly huge.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Love to support small business. I am a sewer and a pattern maker. Although these are beautiful designs, I was disappointed when they arrived. The masks are sewn upside down. This is a common mistake with masks patterns. People don’t know the top from the bottom. The maker needs to switch the pattern around. If you fold the mask in half and touch the ear parts together you can see along the food which part is intended for the nose. The deeper curvature is intended to fit the nose (the biggest part of the face). While the flatter part is for the lips. The maker sewed the nose wire in the side intended for the lips not the nose. They may have designed the floral pattern on the right cheek but the fit is wrong. The correct fit for the sewing pattern they used is intended for the floral pattern to fit on the left cheek. It is unfortunate that the maker does not know how to correctly fit masks to the face. Hopefully the maker reads this and corrects the make of these beautiful masks.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It was very fine and seemed fragile.  Also, I returned it 2 weeks ago and still haven’t received any refund.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I WAS SHOCKED AT THE SIZE OF THESE EARRINGS!  IN THE PICTURE THEY LOOKED LIKE A GOOD SIZE, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THEM, I WAS SHOCKED. TO SAY THEY ARE THE SIZE OF A PEA WOULD CERTAINLY BE A JOKE.  TINY IS THE ONLY WORD TO DESCRIBE THESE EARRINGS.  THE SIZE YOU WOULD PUT ON A CHILD.  OTHERWISE VERY LOVELY.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth the price, is just a printed out picture that you could go to Walmart and do.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It fell off and was list the first time I wore it. But right up until then I loved it. I just had it on a thin blouse, so nothing was tugging. Must be a tad heavy for the magnet. I had ordered another design, but now I am too afraid to wear it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Necklace was very small and chain was very thin. Can easily break if worn. Was a waste of money and worth $1.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I thought this would be like a poster or good quality paper Nope. It's literally a print on photo paper. Looks like someone did it off their computer. It's ok looking but definitely not worth the $12 I paid for it. Also, I thought it would cover in a frame but I read the description wrong. Pretty disappointed with this as it's a gift
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It was printed on felt, but I didn't realize it would be solely two dimensional.  It's not what I was looking for, so it was returned.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Fran broken and canvas is torn
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The shirt has great quality however the logo print is crooked and the shipping took forever.  I understand there are unforeseen impacts due to the Covid-19 but the label was created and I received a shipment notification over a week before the item was actually shipped out.  The seller did explain they've been behind but I was even more disappointed the logo wasnt put on very well upon receiving it today.  The shirt also looks like it runs small so I would size up if you consider ordering.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The decal, despite proper installation, still perled up a section of the graphic. But I had to make it work.<br /><br />And no way this decal should cost thos much. Way, way overpriced.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Unlike the earlier reviews, my purchase came in a brown paper bag and not a cute bag that you could use to pack the slippers in when traveling. The shape is much less defined than in the photos, they aren't particularly comfortable (the heel is quite loose), the felt isn't consistent in thickness and the soles are black rather than matched to the slipper color as in the photos. I'm quite disappointed. I expect more for a $100 pair of slippers.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This poster is wrong. Some of the runes are correct but it has some wrong ones, some that arent Elder Futhark and some that dont even have the corresponding letter under them. If you use this to teach anyone the runes you're going to spread misinformation so please don't. Zero stars because this was made clearly without a working knowledge of the Elder Futhark.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not happy about this product. Not what was shown in the picture Total misrepresented.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this for my daughter’s room. I am very disappointed in the quality of the vinyl. It is cheap and thin and the adhesive on the back is almost non-existent. I have done vinyl crafts many times before and know the key is to work slowly. I spent an hour and a half trying to put this on the wall. The transfer paper was very sticky and it stretched and tore the vinyl as I peeled it off a millimeter at a time. Now the letters are distorted, the dragon is torn in multiple places and it’s already falling off the wall. I doubt it will still be there tomorrow morning. Don’t buy this product!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was so excited to get this and now there will be no time to get a replacement. So sad that this wasn’t checked before it was mailed out. Very poor quality control, it’s already way overpriced. I would have been happy nonetheless had there not been an obvious defect!!!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I should have read the description better so that’s my fault.<br />However to charge someone this much money for only a poster 8x10 print and no frame that’s ridiculous<br />1 photo paper by itself isn’t that expensive<br />2 ink per paper isn’t that expensive<br />3 you can go to the dollar store and get a frame or order them in bulk especially if your running a business.<br />4 cute picture and is going in my bathroom<br /><br />This would just look so much better if it were painted on a piece of wood and more rustic rather than a glossed photo paper.<br />Now I have to find a frame.<br />It’s just a little much. Now satisfied

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Looked cheap
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The only thing handmade about these is that the 'artist' hung a charm from a hook. I bought these charms and they are mass produced.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The strap itself is very good looking.  I got several of these, the other two had velcro closures and this is a slip-on.  Within about an hour of wearing it on my ankle it was very uncomfortable.  Because there's no velcro to adjust the looseness, it rubbed my ankle a lot.  As someone had said, you won't get any sleep measurements with this cover, so will have to remove it from its pouch (takes 10 minutes to get it in the pouch and about 5 minutes to get it out) each night and put the watch on a wrist band to measure sleep.  It does a great job at measuring steps, but the discomfort on my ankle isn't worth it.  Suggest getting a velcro closure instead.  It is very pretty, though.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not the best quality and you can’t return it if you don’t like it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The topper looked great at first, but the plastic is very brittle. While in bubble wrap in a suitcase the plastic split down the middle. We will not be able to use it on our cake this weekend.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Giving this a 3 because the fit was great, but as a bracelet I was using while working out, the fishing line used was just too brittle. The line snapped during a burpee and beads went everywhere. I've only had it for a month and a half. Pretty disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Horrible horrible! Looked beautiful and then about two and a half weeks in it has tarnished so horribly. It looks so bad! Complete waste of money! This was a gift for my 14 year old sister who just lost her dad, I'm so dissapointed

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are not going to be the high quality you want them to be. They have a cheap look to them. Not sure why I’m surprised. And I never got to wear them as they are packaged so light and small that you almost think they sent you an empty package. Mine got thrown away, thought it was a wrapper.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Chain very thin and broke easily without much stress. Broke at links too not at clasp so I wasn't able to repair. Had to return.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These pictures are okay they are small so you will need a mat inside a frame to make them of any size they're good in a small area like a bathroom or an entrance way other than that to use as any kind of Decor they're pretty useless. I thought they would be of a higher quality rather than just a print out on glass paper. I still haven't found a place to hang them yet but I haven't returned them because I do like the pictures themselves. Hope this helps

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The earrings were close but not exactly like pictured. They are a very shinny silver metal base. The picture of Mickey is not sharp/clear with a plastic rounded bubble covering over the picture of Mickey. There is no border around the circle. To me, they were very cheap looking. I was going to return them by the seller required that I pay shipping to return them. I already paid the shipping to get them. Very disappointed, what a waste of money.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These are basically shrinks dink’s with posts glued to them.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Both shelves have terrible groves in them created when the wood was cut or sanded - and with the staining, were very noticeable. Then after measuring (instructions do not have measurements), the shelves do not stay on - they hang and are terribly flimsy. There's nothing to secure them. As I pulled one off, a metal bracket broke. Plus, both pieces are not the same size and since I'm stacking them, it's noticeable.<br /><br />I had to buy brackets to secure to the shelf and wall, and that's the only way I was able to firmly secure this on the wall. That means I only used the wood which is something I could have done from the start.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Disappointed in every respect. Looks cheap. Poor workmanship.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The design of this earring is adorable.  However, the description made it seem like it would be comfortable to wear 24/7.  I wore this to bed the first night I had it, and the wider part of the hoop pressed into my piercing. I woke up in pain and bleeding!  Now I know to just get a round hoop that can move freely in all directions.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The first tags we ordered were excellent...very high quality and nice job on the initials. When I ordered a set for my wife, she only wanted a single initial since her first and last name start with the same letter. When they arrived, the letter T was barely visible. I complained to the company that the size of the single letter was smaller than my tags with 3 letters. There response was...that's the largest size letter we have available and adding my paraphrasing...sorry you don't like it, but you're stuck with it since we don't accept returns regardless of whether you're satisfied or not. Amazon's A to Z return policy also exempts this product?!?
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The two little strips in the back that hold the top to bottom are very thin and will break soon
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I originally bought two. One broke because it’s extremely fragile. Order another one & that arrived in pieces. Packaging that it was shipped in was a shipping envelope and the sign was wrapped in one layer of thin bubble wrap. This should have been shipped in a box, given how easily they break.

You could print this out in photo paper yourself instead of spending $12 on a “poster” that’s printed in photo paper…
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a $25 headband that is supposed to have rhinestones. And there is not one rhinestone on here. It’s merely a piece of fabric with silver on it.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The poster is advertised in a frame, I just found out that the frame is not included. I paid $22 for a 11x14 sheet of paper. Not worth it at all. There should be better communication that the product is NOT as advertised.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cheaply made and the one sided earring wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t turn around and show the back side.  Offered 20% restocking fee and I would pay shipping to return them.  They are in the trash now
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Bought this item for my wife's Bday. I love the idea but...<br /> I was very displeased with quality. The frame is a "laminated" to make it look like wood frame. Glass hides the "paper printed picture" $60 was a little steep for such a small picture size. I would have over looked the size had the quality no looked and felt so cheap.<br />Again great idea but failed on the quality... this husband failed to deliver on this one

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These are beautiful earring that we purchased for my 10yo daughter. Unfortunately, after one day of wearing one of the earrings made my daughter’s ears bleed. Upon removal, we noticed one earring changed color, as if tarnishing; the other did not. The other ear was fine, so it doesn’t seem like an allergic reaction, but like a different material was used. Throwing these away.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Was smaller the expected. was for a charm bracelet was too tiny
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Truthfully, it looked great when I first got it. Packaging was cool and everything. But wearing it is annoying. The build quality is sub par. It didn't stay on my wrist properly when I first started wearing it. I constantly had to adjust it and turn it around.  After a week of wearing it, the part of the bracelet that tightens and loosens it doesn't keep the bracelet snug.  It comes undone and I now I have to constantly keep tightening the bracelet because it keeps falling off. The roping pattern that's used isn't working out too well. I wouldn't get this again.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These earrings were delivered on Tuesday. And today, Saturday they are totally ruined on the back of each earring.  It is as if the black color rubbed off. I am really disappointed and think this is a real ripoff.  Amazon should not sell these

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I had very high hopes that the cost would match the produce, these are very very cheap. Flat metal glued onto wood dipped in green paint with clear coat. The pick makes them look so much more worth it. I do not recommend at all unless maybe for one time use. Very disappointed considering the price. Should only cost 2$ ....
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was really looking forward to these earrings. I had been trying to mind something minimalist, so when I saw them I though, PERFECT! When they arrived I realized they only come with one pair not two. (Which was my own fault for not reading more carefully and assuming based on the picture used.)<br />When they arrived I realized they are not nearly as cute as in the picture. The earring back itself is very cheap and it pinches and rolls easily when putting them on, and doesn’t want to come off.<br />The earrings themselves don’t match. One is smooth and shiny like the picture. The other looks like a hammered nail head. It’s even bent.<br />I wouldn’t recommend these earrings.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is poorly made and very flimsy.  One I ordered had wood that is inconsistently stained.  I would like to know if it is returnable as it is not gift quality.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Shame on me for not paying attention to the size before I bought it. If this poor kid uses this bag for trick or treating we will be done in 10 minutes. VERY SMALL

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The product is only the little cloth face mask, not the larger mask shown in each and every photo. Admittedly, I should have figured this out based on the low price, but still, it's misleading at best and deceptive at worst. I do appreciate how easy it was to cancel this order.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Broke the first time I wore it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Misleading product title!!!<br />I bought this “sign” as a gift for a friend who’s been the hospital for over a month.!When I received it I was a little disappointed to see that it was actually just a photo and not a sign. I ended up having to purchase a frame to put it in which is fine but not what I intended on.  If they didn’t advertise this a sign I would've read more about it. Since I was looking for an actual sign (typically made of metal or sometimes plastic) I probably would not have bought it

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The quality was very good - thick & the fact that it could be personalize, is a bonus. I ordered 2 for my brother & his wife. Unfortunately, it was very short. It would not even fit my neck and I have an almost thin neck. So, what's the use of a good craftsmanship if you can't wear it? Too bad, I could have bought more as a 🎁 since many were asking me where I got my leather lanyard (from another company).
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: very disappointed.  appear cheap.  very lightweight.  I am returning .
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The most disappointing purchased I’ve made in my life. These are printed on glittery stock papers not even white like the picture advertised. There’s weird splatter spots on it too. Don’t waste your money. I’m sure printing it yourself would turn out even better.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It either sticks or it doesn't. I give up.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is not a toy, it cut my son’s finger open.  I bought this for my son’s 2nd birthday to help him learn the letters in his name.  It is nice looking but not a toy to play with.  The letters are not sanded down and they are rough.  The “t” is stuck and not able to be removed.  The sharp edges sliced my son’s finger open within a couple seconds of playing with it.  I do not recommend.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Much thinner than expected. Hard to put in and close comfortably. Didn’t wear for longer than a day. May work better for ears than nose. Cheap quality
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The amulet was way smaller than I expected. I probably should have looked deeper into the product description but I thought for the price, it would have to be a reasonable size....I was wrong and it was puny! I started the return process and was told by the company that it was going to cost about $10 to return and after everything was all boxed up , I was charged $27 to return it! I was disgusted and frankly, rather angry. I’ve never been so disappointed by a product that I bought from amazon...especially something that I purchased as a relic of my personal beliefs. If I could give less than one star, I would.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Ordered thinking it would be on a spool as pictured.  Item description doesn’t say that the spool isn’t included anywhere until you go to “see more” section of the description.  Disappointing and rather expensive not to receive as pictured.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Love the idea. But the lettering doesn’t last. I received my case on Jan 4th. And it looks great. Loved it. Got so many compliments. But as of today, Jan. 15th, my name (Lisa gM) is not legible. Not happy. I use my watch edgy day so I’m not holding my phone often. I’m thinking if the lettering would sit on the inside of the case instead of the outside . It may have lasted a bit longer. I’m searching for another personalized case.

Just one problem--I can't breathe!  For some reason, I get very short of breath wearing the mask with this filter.  Tried it while grocery shopping and I couldn't wait to get out of the store and peel off the mask!  Forget wearing it to work for hours and hours!  Guess I'll keep double masking...

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Front of shirt is great. The image is nice and has an even print. The personalized name on the back is almost see-through screen print - not evenly painted- and doesn’t match the front. It looks cheaply added. Would not purchase again.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture is nice and was delivered on time. But the quality sucks!!!<br />I paid almost $50 for a laminated piece of thin paper. I mean... at least use thick laminate, nope... that's thin too so it easily rips.<br />The grommets are loose and 2 fell off while unrolling the banner which means hanging it from the holes with string rips the corners.  Now I have to tack it to the wall somewhere and it won't be the Center piece.<br />So... I drove from the post office straight to Costco and printed a banner for half the price and better quality than this.<br />Don't buy it!

(Before things fell apart with pandemic) With my last batch and I literally told everyone I know it was the best eye cream ever. This new one I bought (off Amazon for ease) is not the same as my old one I just used up. The container is smaller, the formula has a more yellow tint, it is “harder” in the container and does not go on as smooth. So disappointed as I feel like I need to find a different eye cream now. I won’t be buying more from Mojo.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this for my best friend. This is the photo she sent me. What is wrong with the humming bird.. Is there a worm in the flower? I thought that it would have a greenish antique look. Not at all. She's happy with it.. But I am disappointed that the photo on Amazon is not what it looks like in person. Too bad.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I got this as a gift and the return window closed right before I was giving it to the recipient.  The minute he opened it and began putting it on the color in the words started coming off.  We tried to get it all off, but it wouldn't come off.  It looks awful and appears to truly be cheap workmanship.  Would NOT recommend.  I will come back and add a photo in another review or to this one if possible.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: VERY cute, HOWEVER, and this is just my opinion, I think it's a bit overpriced @$12.00... it's a tiny trincket.. I've placed two of my rings in front of it so you can see in the pics just how small.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This item looked like it had already been used and was very junky looking. The gold was missing in several areas and black was showing through. The package, which I did not bother opening, was chewed up and had holes in it. I ordered it for a party and even though it said overnight delivery, it wasn’t shipped until a couple days later. It did not arrive in time so I had to order something else. Sort of glad it happened that way though because the bracelets I ended up using were much nicer than this one.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: When I received the sign it’s chipped from the sides and the picture is deceiving. The picture shows the piece to have color, but mine came chipped and colorless. It was not painted. When I went to get a refund they are charging me 40 bucks to get it shipped for my refund which was also around 40 bucks.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: In the title of this item it should include the word “MINI” as we opened the package and it’s not at all what we expected. When it said “plaque” we expected it to be 7 or 8 inches big, not the 3 inches it turned out to be.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I followed the directions all the way however the decal isn't sticking at all I had to put tape on the back of it. The unicorn especially was in need of tape to make it stay. I would have returned and still may, but my daughter loves it nonetheless. I wouldn't buy this product ever again especially since I spent the highest amount because I needed for it to be really big over her bed. I am totally dissatisfied with this product. I received a different name decal from another company and it was great no problems at all.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This print was received as a wedding gift and while the thought was nice, the quality of the print could be better. The print is really dark and has no contrast and for $30 and personalized, I would expect better quality.<br /><br />Be sure you don't misspell either...one simple transpose of a letter and the company will not work with you. No return calls made, they expect you to purchase a new one and may offer 25% refund if you fight.<br /><br />Another disappointing factor is this print isn't available on their website, on here on Amazon. We aren't going to ask the person who gifted to buy a new one, nor do we feel the need to give them more money.<br /><br />If the print quality was better as well as CS, we would would have.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It might just be me, but I really didn’t enjoy this. It feels very cheap and doesn’t do much to help with my picking issues. It doesn’t pick easily at all and the materials are just not really great. I really wanted to like this. It’s a great idea, but the quality could be better.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m honestly at lost for words.. it came in the mail yesterday (3/26/22), I washed it ASAP because I was wanting to wear it TODAY (3/27/22).. get it out of the dryer and the words are already coming off??? I just got this shirt not even 24 hours ago… I’m not going through the hassle of arguing over returning the shirt and getting another one made so I’ll just be getting the shirt made somewhere else. So frustrated considering I paid a total of $26.26. AND it arrived late.<br /><br />On the bright side, they put it in a cute watermelon package 😂
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very attractive but no stretch to it so it is very tight on a man.

I contacted the seller to reorder or rectify this order without success. Never heard back from them. If they were made a little thicker and stronger they would have been perfect. Again only got to wear them twice. I don’t sleep in my earrings either.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Horrible horrible! Looked beautiful and then about two and a half weeks in it has tarnished so horribly. It looks so bad! Complete waste of money! This was a gift for my 14 year old sister who just lost her dad, I'm so dissapointed
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This piece of glass looks like a chunk off the bottom of a colored glass bottle.  It doesn’t look like sea glass at all.  It’s clunky and not pretty.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very small
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Love the look of this ring. It LOOKS like it has some weight to it. It doesn’t. Very lightweight which is okay. Main problem was the aquamarine stone. Apparently was glued into place and not with anything strong? I guess what would’ve helped is if they had extended the casing up and over the edges of the stone to secure it in place. Was so sad when it fell off a few hours after I started wearing it and o couldn’t find the stone. If I’d found it I would’ve used something to reattach since I love the look of this ring so much. Unfortunately couldn’t  find the stone and can’t afford to blow off $126 so I had to return. 🥲
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It looks nice but less than a month having it the blue started coming off and sticking to my skin.  I didn’t use it in the shower or with perfumes.  The company gave me my money back but didn’t replace it since they didn’t know why it fell apart.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Definitely a mistake buying this for this amount. Can print it yourself and it would cost you 2 bucks.

After this,  If i don't decide to buy something from Ikea i will walk ouside and get scrap wood and make this for ... well, nothing. The pricing on this product is just silly.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The printing looks beautiful and the ship speed was great, unfortunately the way they attach the lettering is less than ideal.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very disappointing. Poor craftsmanship. Looked nothing like photo— eyes were flat discs instead of spherical. Also none of the eyes were attached to the hat. 2 of the 3 black pupils were not attached either. Hat was smushed because it was sent in a cheap plastic bag inside a plastic mailer. No protective padding.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not buy! Broke in the first 6 hours I had it on!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Robe itself is nice. The writing on the back is VERY hard to read. It is NOT as legible as the sellers photos show (I will post my photo soon) I opted for an exact writing and coloring of robe and letters as seller has posted in her images. I had it made as a gift for my sister in law. I contacted the seller about this. I spent close to $45 including shipping (mind you seller and I are in the same state) and seller wrote back she would refund me IF I purchased another robe and she would try and place the writing in a more blank spot, due to the cut of the floral fabric. In less than 24hrs she closed the Amazon case before I was able to situate this issue. It should be stated that writing and floral cut is not guaranteed to be the same. It makes a big difference when the wording is directly through the flowers and in the same color as the flowers...

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I reached out when ours arrived crooked.  They had me take a picture and said they were sure they had made it correctly so there could not be anything wrong with it and I should try to fix it myself. So I tried. Unsuccessfully. Reached back out twice. Never heard back. Avoid!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Guys, this is not useful. This perpetuates the idea that how you’re feeling about your child’s behavior is more important than how your child is actually feeling or behaving. Also, punishments like timeouts for “bad behavior” are ineffective and alter your child’s attachment security.<br /><br />Speaking from a place of parenting with a degree in psychology with a concentration in behaviorism.

I then asked if she would consider exchanging the ring and I would buy two other rings. I have no use for the ring because it does not fit.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: ...or regret spending over $100 on a floating 8 inch wide shelf.  PLEASE READ IF YOUR ARE ORDERING OVER 6 INCHES WIDE!  It is NOT one piece of wood!!!  It is two they have stuck together which couldn't: 1. Look more tacky if it tried 2. Be more impractical as they are not even solidly attached to each other to make one cohesive piece (They have made '8 inch' out of a 6 inch and 2 inch which are somehow not solidly attached but physically come apart).  The stain is orangey and I don't think the wood is reclaimed or industrial in feel, though it is real.  I hate the edge.  I hate it all.  I was denied a refund and have had this sitting on various floors throughout the house for 5 months since I purchased it.  I have lost the mounting hardware...

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I purchased these dandelion prints for baby’s playroom. Like most other reviewers, I agree that the right-sided picture (without the stems) appears fuzzy and digitized. The worst part is that both of these arrived with a crease, and since the paper has a sheen to it this is very noticeable in the frame. This seller should really package the item better to prevent creasing from happening. (I would return these prints, however I waited to put the prints in frames because the baby is still a few weeks away, and now the return window has closed.)

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice earrings, but the screw back somehow backed off and I lost one earring. So much for my 350 dollars.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am highly disappointed with this product. It is definitely not worth the $20 I paid. It's not even worth $10

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: They sent me a ring with defective ruby stone, one of the tiny stones is not seated properly. overall poor quality for a ring in this price level. also its not free return, I had to pay 18$ to return this defective ring!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The outer box was dry, but the inner box was damp and when we picked the bottle up, it shattered and the fluid spread and there were "magnetic" black blobs and spots all over my face and my white tile sink and counter.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Metal is very soft and discolored very quickly. Not worth 89 dollars.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was excited for this new shirt. The day it arrived I washed it on a regular color cycle made sure to set my washer on cold water and the shirt came out like this! After a single wash the ink on the letters is faded now, it has weird stains and it stained other clothes that threw in with the shirt. Just disappointed with the quality.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The gem was cute but the silver was completely oxidized and I dunno if it's old or new also no where it was marked as a 925 sterling silver.<br />I think I will return it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This product was smaller than expected. Due to the size of the knobs on the letters, it is not suitable for a child aged 1 to 3 years as advertised.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The necklace is designed poorly so that the gem hangs down 90% of the time you wear it. It does not lay flat on the chest with sparkly stone facing forward.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This product is NOT worth what I paid for it.  DO NOT purchase a name board from this company.  The board that the letters fit in is VERY thin and will break VERY easily it's so thin.  The message that I paid extra for on the back of the board is also VERY poor quality.  Some of the letters are very visible and will fade.  I would not have chosen ANY STARS, but I had to choose at least one.  VERY DISSATISFIED!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The butterfly part is pretty but the sticks to attach it looks like or is a painted pencil. Would not have bought it if  I realized that. With shipping costs does not pay to return it.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wanted some wording for a birthday. The letters did not stick to the backdrop and was very fragile. Tore at the slightest tug. When asking about another set or some alternative option…was told it was my fault and nothing could be done. Will take my business elsewhere

I followed the directions to the letter, but part of the decal would stick and the other would try to pull off. I went back and repeated the step to help get it to attach to the cup and was finally able to get 1 of them to work. The second one went on but when I went to pick it up, the decal came right off.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This bracelet is supposed to be for a 10 year old girl. However, the circumference of it is almost 8 inches, which is way too big for a child. Very disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The sticker while very detailed, has a large area that is not the actual sticker and it is very hard to line up on the window correctly.  It is SUPER sticky and if you don't get it placed correctly there is no way to reposition it without damaging the sticker.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These “photo prints” came torn and in an envelope that was so dirty and worn. Like it had been sitting on a shelf for years. I really want these and hope the seller made a mistake and will replace them. So sad as I love them.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Although the looks of this clock fit our decor theme well, the functionality is lacking in that the hands on this clock are not attached very well at all.  The minute hand fell off almost instantly!  We have jerry-rigged it to keep it going, but are strongly disappointed by it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: In the picture it looks like gold (like in the movie Neverending Story). However it's only wood. Then I went to return it, they charged for the UPS shipping which was almost the same price as the product. Definitely wouldn't order from them again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: i bought two sburb logo stickers to put on my car and my water bottle and was really excited to get them, but one of the stickers that arrived wasn’t even remotely the right thing. it was an inspirational quote instead. i was very disappointed.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The setting was beautiful but I prefer the lavender Tanzanite. Sent this back on March 24th and I’m still waiting for my refund.I reached out twice to the seller and have not heard back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Attention seller! Customers should be able to preview what the custom pendant will look like before they purchase. Also, why can't sides 2-4 be written horizontally? Only side one can be? Thats silly
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Was almost 2 weeks later than shipping date. Received refund. When it did show was junk. Would not give as a gift. Would like to return or just throw away or let grandkids have in their toy pile

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The print is not very clear
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: For $60 I expected a little more durability. The 1 bys that were used were not all predrilled like instructions stated. Also sent with sheet rock screws not wood screws, also had plastic drywall anchors but no mounting screws only Sheetrock screws. Screws only allow for approximately 1/2 inch of screw into all portions of the wood including only 1/2in into the wall being mounted on. Do not recommend. Idea is awesome but not for $60.

Perhaps my expectations were high, but the pictures have much more of a handmade appearance, while the actual products do not. Pretty disappointed and would not purchase from this seller again.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are quite small. Only decorative. Not usual or useful wooden spoons.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The stones are beautiful and colorful but I was very disappointed in the cheap string. I would not give this as a gift until I replaced the string. It’s lightweight and value for the money is ok
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: so disappointed. For real these aren't even children size, these are BABY SIZE. Not worth it
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Did not smell like cotton candy.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Couldn’t tell it was flat in photo. The middle area is bumped up where the seed is. Thought it was oval  and encased.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: VERY DISAPPOINTED. I bought a 1981 ring and the number 9 looks like a 0 (zero) then the year is 1081. This was a special gift and THE YEAR WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT but you ruined it.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not impressed with the quality of material or craftsmanship. Very disappointing as I was hoping to add more. Glad I only bought one.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This was advertised as a bandana. It's not a bandana. It's a triangular piece of cloth with two strings attached - not a true bandana. Also, I ordered Large, and what I got had tie strings that would hardly fit around the next of a chihuahua, much less a big dog! I would never trust products by this company again
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed with this item, no scent at all!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These were much bigger than I had thought, and my wife didn't care for them too much because of the size.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The title said this was a set of two. I wasn’t sure if they meant 1 handle and one for the opposite side lifting handle, or 2 handle protectors, but only one handle protector arrived, so please don’t be mislead and disappointed by the item description like I was.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed that it is only photo prints. Not on canvas, not framed, nothing! I would not have paid that amount for photo prints.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The product smells super strong in the bottle -almost very chemical like. I followed the instructions on the bottle, but there was no smell upon hitting the water and there was so little salt used (and none of it actually the beneficial bath salt) that the bath wasn't as pleasant. I hate to give a small business a bad review, but this formulation needs to be revised.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It's literally a printed piece of paper that was laminated. You could 100% make this at home if you have a printer, NOT worth paying what they're charging for it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Like tons of others who did not read the product details carefully enough, I expected this to be metal.  It is printed on photograph paper.  Now I have to frame it.  The thing that bothers me the most about it is that I have doubts that the actual artist was involved in this transaction.  For all I know I just overpaid an art thief.  What a racket!  The octopus model probably wasn’t paid either.  At least it is a wonderful image.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The necklace was so small my 7yr old is wearing it. It's too bad I like the necklace too.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the size of the disk and length of the chain, but very disappointed that the rings holding the disks on have already tarnished after a few short wears. Allergic to silver and can only wear when gold plating is true.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am disappointed, once I tried to frame it, I don’t like that the font looks too thin, can be better. I don’t recommend this one.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: What's good - Really fast delivery - thank you!<br />  - Good quality leather.<br /><br />But inner part of the wallet's skin makes a fold once you are closing it and that fold pushing back the wallet. Basically it will be always open, unless it's in your pocket. Not what I expected, especially for this money. Probably I got unlucky and received unsuccessful model - I do not know. But I am disappointed

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is a wildly popular holster. I bought it since it was on sale and I had other products from them. This time, I am disappointed. The product is very bulky making on belt carry feel/look silly. It lacks any refinement on the edges and is just a massive rectangle. The clip juts out so the bottom of the holster is flapping. Being a piece of plastic, it does not feel like it will last. I find myself bumping this holster into things at random, it is so bulky. I would return it but not worth the hassle.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Absolutely a joke!!! Ours doesn’t work right, it just pulses but the colors don’t change so unless you happen to be looking straight at it… you won’t notice. WASTE OF MONEY. we wanted it for our 3 year old who has a deployed parent.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very bulky ring.  This ring actually bruised my finger.  Returning is a hassle so I just threw it out!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth the money. I can’t smell a thing. I even tried the free samples they sent. The only reason I purchased this is because it’s the only one made in the US. But steamers from other companies are a lot more powerful with nice aroma.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Esta bonita pero la cadena se ve muy barata y de mala calidad
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not purchase, you will lose it and be sad. Would like to give no stars. The bar was very short. It did fit okay as far as the thickness of my piercing hole but the bar that bent was very short so it kept falling out of my nose. I lost it within 2 days of owning it. A complete waste of money. I am very disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not at all what I was expecting—very disappointed—if I didn’t know this was my first name, I wouldn’t recognize it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was really optimistic about this iPad case. The reviews were good, the price was fair, and I was okay with the delayed shipping from China. It's been a few weeks since I received it in the mail and I haven't even been able to use it. The oil they used for the leather apparently doesn't dry...ever. I'm assuming they just used too much leather oil. I received it in the mail 15 days ago and it's still damp. I put a fan on it for 48 hours...still damp. I set it on a shelf in my garage where it's warm but not hot...still damp. I tried putting the case on my iPad but it leaves a thick film on the screen because the oil is so damp. I didn't leave the case on for more than 60 seconds. The case does look nice. If the case ever dries out, I will add another star to my review.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It came with half the amount of screws, no pre-drilled holes, no stickers, and the screws aren’t even long enough to put the thing together.<br />Not worth the money paid for a few pieces of wood.<br /><br />Make sure u have your own screws & your own way to out this together successfully.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These were my favorite, stylish, fake nose rings that I ordered. They were cute, fairly comfortable, and stayed in place. Unfortunately, while the ring itself held up nicely, the decorative parts fell out within a few months. They need to secure them better before I would consider buying them again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Came in with May 2017 - May 2018<br />It's ordered in August 2017...  only May and June 2017 have expanded pages.  Will not order again!  Due to starting a new job in 2 days, cannot send back - need a calendar of some sort.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The pic with 3 stamps is what I was sent of how the stamp would look. the other 2 are what it looks like. It's blurry. I can't read my name clearly or the I was told I've used the wrong ink. It's water based ink that I use on all my stamps.  I did ask for and received a refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I had high hopes for this product, I like the look of the design. I really wanted to like it. The problem is it’s made of an extremely lightweight material that causes it to tip over all the time. Taking glasses on and off it knock it off balance, lightly bumping against it causes it to tip. A simple solution would be a weighted base, which it doesn’t have. It is now broken since it tipped and crashed onto floor and broke apart. For the price, I would have been better buying a paper towel holder and sticky tape. Very disappointed, would not recommend buying. Gave it two stars instead one one since we did get a year worth of use out of ( even though it tipped all the time) before the final tipping broke it
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I really liked this septum piercing and it looks lovely, but the circumference of the hoop is very small, so it's not very comfortable to wear. Also, you have to bend the hoop itself to "open" and "close" the jewelry, which makes it basically impossible to return it to the exact same shape and is also uncomfortable if the hoop gets twisted and the slightly open side gets in your nose.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered this for a birthday gift.  I didn't realize until I received it, that is was just a paper print.  The cost for the "print" was much more than I think it should be.  Especially since it doesn't include a frame and I have that additional cost.  Don't recommend it.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I am thankful for my shepherd staffs but was spoiled by the finer craftsmanship of the first one which is six inches longer, much straighter, much thicker, and also quite functional. This latest staff that I received bends easily. The first staff is about perfectly round, straight and strong. It won’t bend. The latest one is thin, flat down the front and flat down the rear though the sides are rounded. It bends easily and I’m afraid it will break. Having received a less than satisfactory reply I must give this particular staff a low rating.

Setup was nothing: you pretty much just plug it in and it works. Awesome! ...for about 4 months. Then they stopped connecting and just stopped working. Now they’re useless. So yeah—super cool while they last. Unfortunately they don’t last very long at all. Just came home one day and it wasn’t working. I expected them to hold up a lot longer than just 4 months!

When I saw the price, I was even more excited.<br /><br />My original bottle fell and broke, so I decided to go online to the original website to purchase. I decided to purchase from Amazon as the seller is the actual company and not a reseller.<br /><br />Problem 1: They advertise this is using olive oil from their farm.<br /><br />Problem 2: They don’t use olive oil, as they use Sunflower oil which is a hormone disruptor and much cheaper than olive oil. They lied about being made with olive oil.<br /><br />Problem 3: The scent is nothing like the one I fell in love with years ago. This néw sunflower oil based one has no scent and dies down within in 5 mins.<br /><br />I’m extremely disappointed and was really forward to supporting this business, but they changed the formula to a cheaper and less quantity ingredients

However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I received my canvas a few days ago and I was so excited when I seen it was close to arriving. But when I received the package was way smaller than the picture on Amazon makes it look. So I was disappointed that it was smaller than I expected and it cost me $120 for something that was a print out of a picture. I would’ve been OK with it if I paid $50 for it at max before $120 and how the Display picture makes it seem it’s very disappointing when it’s not anything like that.

The fragrance when I opened that package was minimal - had to stick my nose right up near the wax - and when I put it in the melter, it disappeared altogether.  The cubes are even seriously greasy when handling.  The packaging was even hard to get open.  These are not worth the money spent, for sure.<br /><br />This may be the first single star review I've given an actual product (not a digital) on Amazon, but here it is.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Was embarrassed to give as a gift. Gold filled should have a stamp with amount gold. Not worth 10$. Not yellow like the picture, orange not shiny. Came on a card for hanging on junk rack.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It was silver not gold!  Feeling ripped off.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not only was it messed up but I couldn’t fix it and probably won’t get it by the actual wedding photo date! Very disappointed!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It needs to be thicker
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Barely any pigment so disappointed
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It was really cute, but the name wore off in several places within a week or so. Disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The necklace is nice just can’t wear it my wife almost lost it because the clipping mechanism has a gap and the spring that keeps it from opening isn’t functional. Not worth the price for it not to work properly.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cheaply made not worth the money
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cheaply made sent back
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Looks really cool, but doesn't stick to the wall. We followed the directions exactly and took our time. An hour later, my son was screaming that it was already on the floor. I've used decals before, never had ones with such terrible glue.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Really wanted to like this decal, unfortunately the included instructions were very unclear in their verbage. Watching the video they referenced did help somewhat.<br /><br />Biggest gripe: The decal is NOT cut to the 4Runner window; you have to do it yourself. Applied one side and it looked terrible, also did not stick well (doubt it would survive an automatic carwash). My recommendation, go to a local shop that specializes in auto decals/wraps and have them do it.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Stone had major flaw (crack) in center
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: If I could give a zero I would. Will not issue a refund. The product is very misleading, saying it’s for fridge, but showing microwave.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I love how it came out… but it was for my mom for Mother’s Day, and I specifically put my brothers name down too! When it got here it’s was only my name….. it’s a great gift but come on at least so what I requested…
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I could have found this on the internet and printed it for $2 anywhere else.  It is not a poster and it is NOT worth $13.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Horrible Product as soon as I opened the Jar the whole thing smelled Moldy,... No wayyyy in Heak am I putting that into my hair and the Jar is Tiney Idey Bitty---- Into the Garbage you go!,... (Thumbs-up)
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought two of these as Christmas gifts for my nieces. Glitter was falling out of it inside the package like it wasn't sealed. The girls wore them one time, and the first time they did, the neclace fell apart. For the price I paid these, they are 100% NOT worth your money! I'm so upset because the girls AND everyone else loved them so much.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Horrible quality.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Turned my neck green almost immediately
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This thing is smaller than you think.  About half the size of a shot glass.  That isn't the problem though, the problem is that the matches don't work.  I broke about 10 of them before giving up.  And each time you strike one, it leaves a large black streak on the side.  I also read reviews saying that only the matches that it comes with will work... you can't just by any strike-anywhere match.  Well, I'm sorry to say but the matches that it comes with don't work either!  If this thing was a little bigger, it might be worth it just to keep as a decorative jar on your shelf.  But it is way too small for that.  And being that the matches don't work either, this thing is worthless.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The necklace looked like it was about to break and looked like it was rubber, Was not pleased. Still waiting on refund over two weeks
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Product would not transfer onto my shirt.  when I tried to get refund it came back that it had been resolved.  It had not been resolved.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: They don't tell you the dimensions of this so you don't even know if it will fit your mailbox  I'm really surprised that they c harge so much for a decal.  I found an aluminum sign that's 14 x 10 and it only cost 30 dollars.  This cost close to 50 dollars.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very small and recipient said could tell painted by hand
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cheap looking and not worth the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is probably the most problematic earring design because it’s point of open/close is right where it should be in your ear!?!? The loop needs to open/close to the end near the stone or ball point
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Ordered all 3 of these photos. The first 2 came quickly and it great shape and excellent quality however this last photo took a month to arrive (from China) and is printed on a completely different type of material and is a different color so it does not match the other 2. Very unsatisfied with the quality of this.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Unable to use. Back of plate is flat not concave. Unable to screw it to the wall. Large gap. Not made correctly.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Well, the earrings are quite lightweight, even flimsy. the color is advertised as gold, but it's actually silver. Not recommended.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I didnt like the chain. Too cheap looking
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This lil bitty poster to expensive for the material that has been used, ( regular paper) the size was waaay to small , and the wait was horribly long! Never ever will I order Again, this was for my son, and he was so disappointed, just like me!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very thin. The houndstooth pattern isn't legitimate. Not worth 20 dollars

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Awful. Size is about 1/8 in if that. U can’t see it. What a piece of garbage. How can u sell this. Want credit. Not bothering send back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: not worth 40 bucks. the leather is stiff and wrinkled, it's lined with a cheap material and the zipper was broke. too bad it wasn't as nice as the picture led me to believe
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful to look at it but the cigarette smoke smell is overwhelming, ugh!  Do not want to put this in my little girl's room now.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Buy some black craft wire and wrap it around a die.  That's what you're getting.  Not happy with this at all.  Super cheap looking.  Save your money.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This broke my nose out and created an infection even though I cleaned my face twice a day!Ended up taking it out and my hole grew up because it caused an infection from the material or fake paint that was on the hoop!Do not buy if you have sensitive skin or easily get infections from jewelry!It swelled the whole side of my nose up three days after having it in!It is one hundred percent fake and NOT 14 k gold plated!It looks like gold spray paint when I received it in the mail and opened it.Also very dull and painful to get in even though my piercing was a full year old! Splurge and buy real and don't waste your money!This is like something that came out of a quarter machine!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Product is advertised as larger than it actually is. This necklace would look good on a toddler so if you don’t like really tiny jewelry …don’t buy from this seller…return shipping costs exceed the value of the item….definitely NOT WORTH IT! 👎

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I wear earrings all the time and this is the very first time I've run into this problem - as pretty as these earrings are I cannot get even the tip of the post part of the earring into my earlobe.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I received this item twice. The first one the dye from the beads soaked into the skin (if it were authentic there would be no dye to come off). When I returned it I asked for a refund, not an exchange. However, I received an exchange. So we tried it again and the samething happened. At this point, I'm not sure what to do being I didn't receive a refund when I first returned it and I do not want another exchange... Buyer beware!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s beautiful but they changed the name and size from what they had as a sample  when I ordered mine. They had it long and thin. Perfect for where I was going to put it. I cannot use it in my arch. I could have if it had looked like the size shown when I ordered mine.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: You can create better ones
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The letters and the heart is cute. But the chain is not the same gold color as the charms. It is a darker, tarnished color. It doesn’t look good with the charms so it is not wearable.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Small  and works for keychain but is 3D printed and doesn't sound like it's supposed to

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The scent is lacking. They dissolve too fast. Not good
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I had high hopes for this necklace and was very underwhelmed at the size of the chain and the ball beads.<br />I had trouble putting on and taking off the necklace by myself and I think that whenever I wear it, it will really not be noticed or add anything to my overall look.  The chain is so small I could not even get a focused photo of it. The closest I could do was when it was still in its little bag (the bag is 1 1/2" x 2 1/2"). Each bead is about 1/16" width.<br />Although it is in a "velvet pouch" (see photo 5 with the "G" the company name partly missing), the necklace was not "ready to give". It was in a small plastic bag and that bag was sealed inside aslightly larger plastic film. If you were going to present this as a gift, you need to do some rewrapping to prevent it from looking so cheap.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap , cheap material
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Unfortunately it's to small to wear. It's beautiful though.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The leather is not as heavy as I thought it would be. The engraving is so deep it looks like it is through the whole thickness of the leather. Very ugly color. Has a loose thread where the two pieces go together. It is a nice size to carry in your pocket. It is overpriced for what you get.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Did not last, broke immediately. Fit well but broke.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this as a gift and is not really sterling silver. really bad quality and fake
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Since there is no clasp or closure the gap part gets caught in the actual piercing sight and it hurts and irritates it. I wish it had a tiny bead or something to close it to avoid the pain.  I’ve had the same ring in previously for 24 years no issue until I accidentally broke it taking it out. This one caused problems on day one.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Engraving was barely readable

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was excited to receive these bath bombs only to be very disappointed. You don't have an option to pick your scents. So, you have to trust what you receive will be nice. I purchased one box for myself and one as a gift. Out of 12 total bath bombs approximately 5 smell acceptable. I recommend the vendor allow the purchaser to choose scents. This will allow the vendor to track what is working/popular and what should be ccx eliminated from the product line. I did appreciate the fact each bath bomb is individually sealed. Nice touch.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought imagining it would be a nice piece of card stock.  Something I could put in my office. However when it arrived, I was disappointed to find it’s just printed on Fujifilm photo paper. Not what I expected for $11.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Incredibly angry. With expedited shipping I paid $60 for two t-shirt. Neither shirt arrived prior to  our departure for our trip or the date guaranteed. The shirts were not even personalized. Seriously, terrible.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I hate giving any &#34;mom and pop&#34; company a bad review, but facts matter. Was so excited to find some pumpkin scents &#34;our of season!&#34;<br /><br />Nope, scent, fully melted can't be enjoyed it's so weak in the room with the burner. Sigh.....burnt one from one of three packs, two days ago and even hubby and his sensitive nose couldn't detect it unless quite close to the burner, so skipped a day and just wiped another out of the burner, this time the Pumpkin cupcake.<br /><br />Is it the soy that somehow makes these things weaker than non-soy?? because I bought soy squares from two different companies in this one order and it's weak, too!!<br /><br />Help me and yes, some of you I hope will still try this label and give them a chance, just in case......I right now have another, known and reliable brand in my burner, so when it's totally melted awhile I am going to walk into the garage and back into the house to see if it's *my nose* or for sure, this product.<br /><br />I am honest and sincere. I do not own wax company or know anyone that does. I'm hooked on the stuff. Heck yeah, there's something cool about aromatherapy but I am surprised to even be able to say this.<br /><br />To the owners, are you maybe not using enough oil? Not buying a strong enough oil product? Then if not, help me understand, how is it that Walmart's &#34;ScentSationals&#34; brand is, not all scents for any one nose, but a lot of theirs are strong! so strong that I can smell it out of the room it burns in and across a large livingroom, the other side of it?<br />Yesterday, I took a break from these two new brands and burnt &#34;Warm Apple Pie&#34; by walmart and dang!! it was barely melted and we both were smelling it 20 feet and more, from the burner, then as expected it filled the two rooms, honestly and it is not soy.<br /><br />So, is it possibly that we are not meant to be fans of *any brand* of SOY? if so....folks reading this, please give this brand more chances,<br />God bless the owners cuz dang, am surprised and not happy about this.

It looks like it could be for a little kid.. still cute but small. I did get my money back Cuz it never showed up till after the holiday..

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m not rough with my phone, I take good care of my things. But I looked down earlier today and realized somehow beads were all over my floor. The string didn’t come apart at the knot, it just somehow frayed and fell apart. Wish I had my money back.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I returned these earrings because it didn’t meet my expectations. I was looking for earrings to compliment a sterling silver moonstone ring I purchased for a song at an antique mall. The stones in the earrings are faceted and had NO high lustrous shine, like the ring, plus it was so much more in price than the ring I cherish.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The video was really helpful to put in, but it irritated my skin and started turning green within a few weeks of wear. This could have been my fault because I have long nails and used some tweezers to help adjust it which did scratch the metal a bit. Overall super cute and I liked how it looked but may not be great for long term wear. I've had my nose pierced for about 10 years and it usually is tolerant to any jewelry I use for it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not at all what I was expecting! I got this because Amazon can't figure out which house is which despite all our mail boxes are numbered!  The bracket is plastic and a little on the flimsy side, the pole is 1/16" thick (light gauge) metal tubing that might be powder coated, not sure. The sign is a respectable gauge metal though it is using applied (stickers) reflective numbers. The lamp is a cheap plastic thing that might survive 6 months outside. All in all while it looks decent (in the pictures), it's not worth the $100 + I paid for it, $50 - $60 is a more appropriate price. Feeling a little ripped off!<br /><br />3 months later.....<br />The sign has now fallen off, due to the sign rocking in the wind the holes have worn through and I found the sign laying on the ground. The holes in the sign need to be re-enforced somehow to prevent wear, not sure how but it's going to be easier just to buy something else rather than fix. Has turned out to be a waste of money. Oh, BTW, the lamp is no longer working, not that it worked that well to begin with!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The design looked great but the stamp is not defined enough to transfer completely on egg carton; especially the middle part of the chicken that says Fresh Eggs. Even when I put a block of wood under the carton lid to make a harder surface, the transfer is horrible.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The beads are not that brilliant, kind of dull. The gold colored beads are wearing on the edges. For the price I wouldn’t buy it. If it was $5.99 I might get it. Colors super dull.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was excited to get a cover for my bolster, but unfortunately I never got to use it because the cotton was not pre-shrunk and I didn’t notice at the bottom of the long description with all of the size options that it says it must be washed below 30° C (which I had to look up when the shop owner pointed it out to me, it’s 86° F). So I threw it in the wash with the rest of my sheets and when it came out it did not fit. No dryer even.<br /><br />But I am not going to order a replacement because I don’t want a pillowcase that I have to wash separately from all of my other linens. And I don’t have a dryer now, but when I do I won’t want to have to hang dry one dumb pillowcase. That’s way too high maintenance for a pillowcase! And while technically she did warn me in the description, if an item does require special treatment then it should have a tag with clear instructions rather than requiring people to read long descriptions that mostly are just size options, understand international conversions, and then remember said special instructions.<br /><br />It is well sewn though. She just should have used pre-shrunk cotton instead of passing all of this hassle on to the customer.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Updating my review: These have started to turn green and accumulate gunk where the backing meets the earing. The metal has turned black. I no longer feel comfortable putting these in my ears as I fear an adverse reaction with my sensitive skin or even an infection. Cannot recommend these earring any longer which is unfortunate because they were my favorite pair and looked so stunning but the quality is not where it needs to be.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this to replace an older tortilla warmer that I accidentally burnt, figured it had to be very similar in construction from the looks of it and with such a cute graphic! But no… it is poorly designed, there is only thin cloth layers instead of the efficient construction of other brands that include thicker, puffy cloths layered with a film to protect the tortilla from drying out and preventing a fast temperature drop after heating, and also the size  does not allow for many tortillas… ended up replacing it right away with a larger, much better constructed warmer that I am including in the picture for comparison. If you ABSOLUTELY GOTTA HAVE THE GRAPHIC, then consider that you will need to layer up, or your tortillas will be hot only coming out the microwave and then get dry and cold before you even finish rolling up your taco.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was disappointed with the quality. I thought it would be heavier duty for the price. I was also surprised  and disappointed with how small the side pockets were. I thought I would put a metal water bottle in the side, but it is too small. This bag is cheap and won't hold up with daily use. The personalization is cute, but I wish I would not have ordered it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This item is for use in kitchens and the wood is not sealed.  Before I can mail it I will have to use a wood sealer to make sure it is protected.  It was hard to tell from the pictures just how thin the wood was so hopefully it will hold up to extended use.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Vintage - It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human society. An item should be at least 100 years old to be defined as an antique. Generally speaking if the item is no older than an antique but not less than 20 years, it falls under the term vintage.

Wouldn't buy again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The decal did not come off correctly using the wet or dry application. We had to pull them off and try and stick them on the wall ourselves individually. Even the few stars that came off semi easy are mangled. This is supposed to be a “D”.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I really like the size of the letter on my finger. Looks very dainty, which was the goal. However, I’ve worn it for three days and caught it on a thread and a price tag while shopping and it bent both times (I reshape it myself). I don’t think it’ll hold up long with everyday wear. I knew it would be a thin band but I didn’t think thin would also mean really mailable and weak — simile to a wire. I’ll enjoy the wear I do get from it but wouldn’t buy again.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I know that the size is listed as part of the "oh by the way" information, but who looks at dimensions carefully?

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I got a large and it fit like a small.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Liked the deep rich color of the grips without any cloudy or milky spots from the sealant. The Navy medallion is nice touch and large for the grip. The set of grips I received the medallion sticks up way too much on the edges and would mess up my touch while gripping my firearm. The medallion should be recessed further into the grip so that it is flush with the checkering of the grip on the edges. If that is possible because of the size of the medallion.  However, again because of the size it should also have a slight curve. The original Colt gold medallions have a screw/nut to retain them in the grip. These do not. My grip set had clear cement smeared all around the medallion and into the checkering. Was able to clean up with old toothbrush and so not to sure about durability. I spent the 10.99 for 2day shipping however must return for refund or exchange : if, recessing the medallion to remain flush on the outer edges is possible. Mine sticks up above the wood. I might give this another try. Will update-<br />Well, I was told to return as they could not recess the Navy medallion any deeper into the grip to make it flush.<br />However, The medallion popped right off of the grip and with a boring bit you can fix their mistake and lack of support for shoddy workmanship. These would NEVER hold up with everyday use sticking up like they were. So I revise my review to 1 star...

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very fragile chain..<br />I loved the necklace. I told myself I would wear it everyday. However, on the second day of wearing it, the chain got tangled in my baby hairs again on the back of my neck and broke. I never pulled on it hard or anything like that though because I knew it was fragile.<br />And also, when I first received the package, there was a knot in the chain because they hadn’t coiled it around anything and left it free flowing to tangle itself.<br />So overall, I love the heart charm with my engraved letter on it, but the chain is too fragile.

I added a second star because there is a link to a video where you can hear the song before purchasing.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Most uncomfortable noise ring I've ever worn in my life. Says it is Sterling silver, maybe plated, but is definitely nickel or some other cheap metal. It tarnished and caused severe irritation to my piercing (redness, tenderness, and swelling) and NO my piercing is not new, it was done over a decade ago. For around the same price, sometimes less, you can get a 4pk of nose rings from Ruffian that are WAY BETTER, in my opinion, they've never caused me any issues and I've used them for almost 3 years now. It makes me genuinely sad, this was so cute and I had such high hopes. Don't get me wrong, IT IS SUPER CUTE, I was in love with it when I first put it in, but after barely a day my nose was soooo sore and when I took out the nose ring to look at my piercing the ring was black, washed my piercing immediately and put in a hoop from my Ruffian pack and was fine in a couple days, haven't had a problem since.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cheap. Bent out of shape after very little use. Don’t waste your money.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I purchased this ring in 2016 along with a number of her other delicate band and earrings at the time.<br /><br />This one is »super cute« on the hand, and I got lots of compliments on it! Absolutely adorable design, very feminine and delicate. I loved this ring while it lasted...<br /><br />But be aware, when she says "delicate", she's not only describing the look of the band, but also the durability. The soldering joint separated within the first week of daily wear. It didn't catch on anything; I was just typing on my computer when I felt it "pop" open. Really?<br /><br />So if you purchase, be prepared to wear it only on special occasions...which is a shame because it doesn't deserve to sit in a dark drawer our jewelry chest!!  It's really too pretty for that!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: they are smaller than I thought, but that's ok. One earring was missing the loop that goes through your ear and the other earring  broke off when I tried to get it out of the box. I'm sorry to say I threw them out. I requested a refund  (gift card) to buy something else but was asked to return them which I can't because I threw them out. I guess I lose!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cute but graphic gets cracking after washing<br />(Hand wash)
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The “La Valse d’Amelie” Eiffel Tower Music Box is VERY disappointing! The craftsmanship is poor-the design appears to be a decal. As for the music-I cannot recognize the music. It requires hand cranking and the music doesn’t flow, it’s sporadic. Also, the music stops when you stop turning the crank!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very disappointed. I could have printed this at home on my own printer. It's cute, but just a sheet of printed paper. Not at all worth the price I paid. Hope it looks better framed. I seldom write a negative review as I am always pleased with my amazon purchases. As they say, there's a first time for everything.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: beautiful earrings. unfortunately I wore them ONE day and the silver surrounding the earring has turned black on one side. Very disappointed
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I lost a similar Magnolia earring and purchased as a replacement piece.  Junk right out of the packaging.  The wood was alright but the hooks were cheap.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: too small<br />too difficult to fasten together<br />like it’s missing a link
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Absolutely awful! Way too small for my fingers to even put in my nose. More expensive to ship back. What a waste of money!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was super excited about this but it really wasn't it. The smell is mostly giving soap and it wears off so fast. Not worth it and definitely not the beautiful scent you are hoping it is.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I want to love these bc they’re so cute, but I can already tell the adhesion is really bad. They keep peeling off and I’m constantly  fixing them. Would not recommend and would like my money back
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: My daughter was so excited for these to come, but sadly they came with a white blemish that appears to be paint on one earring. That earring also contains scratches in the clear coating. The other earring appears well made and would be worth 5 stars for appearance, quality, and packaging. Unfortunately the ruined earring makes these unusable.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This window decals came with 2 identical tears/cuts. The vynil for those 2 places was not on the transfer paper. I contacted the seller and their words were "if you want a replacement order it". This is made from oracle vynil and you'd be better off making it yourself. Horrible seller!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These are cute postcards, but be warned that every single one I sent out got returned to my new address. The design of the postcard puts your new address right next to the address you are sending the card to and the Post Office machine cannot differentiate. It’s a bad design and a huge waste of money for the cards and all the stamps to send them right back to yourself!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This made me very disappointed and mad. It was literally a piece of oddly bent wire.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Was very happy with it but it did not last. Yes, i placed it properly and cleaned the surface. I ordered only a couple months ago and its already falling off.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I purchased these because I wanted to offer something unique to my customers. In the photo these look rather large. However, the blossoms are only about an inch or less in diameter
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The shoe was to short.  I contacted the seller.  She wanted me to go to a shoe repair store and have them stretch them.  I refused.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This fragrance is not as described. Honestly it smells like a cold musty basement. I was highly dissatisfied with this purchase but it’s not worth the money to return them.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Super irritating and my ears aren’t typically sensitive.  Could’ve just been my own bad experience.  Worth trying out for the money to see for yourself!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The color is not the same as in the photo. Returned for refund
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The felt balls are a nice color and good quality. However, the photo was very misleading. If had realized I would have needed to count the number in the photo to compared to how many actually come on the strand, I wouldn’t have bought it.  It only reaches 7’ because the thin string they are on is that long. Instead, with the number of balls on it, as opposed to the photo, they have to be spaced so far apart to reach the advertised length, and it’s just not as cute as the photo makes them out to be.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Such a wast of money. This is the smallest flimsiest metal that you can tell they just snipped from a spool of long wire and made circular. Don’t wast your money.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered these for a friend whos mother passed away 10 yrs ago named Penny.  These I thought would be perfect, but when they arrived they are literally pennies with a hole and a hook.  They didn't seem like anything super special.  I did send them back and the seller was very quick to return funds.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: After reading all of the review about sizing, we did exactly what was written in the description with the measuring his wrist, and the bracelet was a good inch too long for my husband's wrist when it arrived.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Broke the first hour worn. They use a very flimsy string.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This was supposed to be a Christmas gift now it’s trash. I know cursive writing of all styles and calligraphy. The second letter is not an “R” or “r”. No refunds means this is trash.<br />If you order from these people, you don’t know what you’re going to get Take a chance if you want to I wasted my money and need to buy another gift for Christmas
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I hate to do this but after looking at these shoes for 2 years I finally decided to buy them as a birthday present to myself.<br /><br />I love the way they look and the quality of the leather but after trying to wear them multiple times I've decided that they are unbearable.  It honestly just feels like I am walking on wood blocks.  I wish it wasn't the case because I love the way they look but I just can't.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s supposed to be blue, for the month of March. I got it for me since my daughter is a March baby. Definitely disappointed
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Kept the pits perfumed and odorized for a max two hours before fading; and this occurred 24/7. Not to mention the something-wood scent was not even strong and satisfying. Have a second thought before spending your money on the wood-scented one, maybe the lavender would be different. Total ripoff.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: After putting it on it doesn't take very long and it loosens up and falls off.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Was unable to see an example for the letter I wanted, which was an O, it was pretty hard to tell what it really was.  The swirl at the beginning of the O conflicted with the O itself.  The person I gave it to really had a hard time figuring out what was the top, bottom or sides.<br />.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful until I wore it in the shower.  Turn green.  None of my .925 silver does.  Very disappointed
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: After just a month both items lost the magnets from the back of the item.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The bracelets are cute but very cheap looking. The magnetic claps come undone very easily so you have to be careful when wearing them. The package did arrive earlier than the expected delivery date but I was very disappointed to see how cheap they were. The silver clasps were dirty looking. They werent evem shiny. They are ok for the price I guess but, I wouldn't buy them again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: First of all the name is a STICKER! It took forever to be delivered. The lid cracked after the first hand wash. Then when trying to use it a second time I pulled off the lid and half of the lid came off and half of it was still stuck in the cup. This is a cheap cup that isn’t worth a penny of your money!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: After reading all the positive reviews, I had high expectations.  I've used the wallet for 2 weeks now and I am very disappointed.  Whenever I pull the wallet out to pay, everything is in disarray.  The credit cards turn sideways, even the bills slip around.  All the credit cards touch each other, creating wear, and it is difficult to pull just one card out.  I finally decided that this wallet is not for me, only to find out that returns are not easy.  You get stuck with both shipping charges and they tell you that the product has to be in new condition.  This is ironic because when the product first arrives, Mr. Lentz tells you give it some time and "wear it in" before deciding if you like it or not.  All around not a good experience.  I do not recommend this wallet.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered a shirt with aqua glitter (picture attached) and received more of a royal blue.  Would not buy again.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very slight lilac scent.  After about 10 minutes scent compleletly gone.  What ever the powder is, it also caused a mild rash.  I tried contacting the seller with NO response at all.  Now it's to late to even return.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Loved the rings initially. I tried the blue one  on and then went to switch it out for the other  one. It broke down the middle. Disappointed because the rings are beautiful and light weight, but the quality is poor.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I agree with another review; this product looks like it was printed off the computer.<br />The saying is nice and my son will like it for xmas, but worth about half the price.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Buyer beware: Sadly, this ring is nothing I’d hoped nor that the seller described —and— the seller was no help.  Smaller than standard sizing and the stone was acrylic/glass but NOT quartz.  A pretty disappointing consumer experience on Amazon.

I received today and I was disappointed, I wish the font used was prettier, I got coordinates for where I met each of them and it just looks plain. Also, one band has a scratch on it. I’ll still gift them since I can’t return them, but I’ll be looking for something else since I’m not impressed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Super cheap and not worth your hard earned money. Both items (pins and FAKE Hair Tie cost me $36 with $16.21 in shipping costs, bringing me to a GRAND TOTAL OF $52!! The pins are your run-of-the-mill bobby pins with charms hot glued on. The Licorice piece can barely fit any hair and just has a clip hot glued on the back (third slide with actual hair band and my hand for scale). DO NOT BUY THIS!!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It is a nice, sturdy bag but disappointed in the print. It is a faded gray color- not black as it appears in the 2nd picture taken from the page on Amazon and you can barely make out the “at” in pink- which appears red in the picture on Amazon. Disappointing as this is a gift and didn’t have time to exchange.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very beautiful ring. Edge is a bit sharp and I suspect you want a loose fit otherwise it would dig in your skin. My big disappointment came when I noticed what appeared to be silver paint or glue on the gem along the setting (see pictures). I tried lightly scraping it off with little result. Normally, such a blemish would cause the ring to get rejected for sale. I would have rated this ring with 5 stars but with such a blemish, 2 stars is appropriate.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Put them in light all you see is clear glass. Looks like the product of that lab grown kit you get at the dollar store. Not happy. Was gonna be used to make an engagement ring… better off buying a whole ring. They’re cute though but just dyed glass..
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The setting on the ring was messy. It looks like they just melted the metal around the rock and took no time to clean it up to look “dainty” as advertised. For the amount I paid, I expected better.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: this hoop is so cute but unfortunately not real gold. i received this hoop as a gift almost a year ago and noticed irritation the day after putting it in. I looked at the packaging and it looked like it was from a cute small business that makes jewelry and trusted it was real gold. i assumed my irritation was just due to switching from a stud. nearly 8 months later my nose has been on and off infected despite me taking care of it. luckily, when I took the hoop out to clean it the metal bended and wouldn’t look like a hoop anymore. I went into the jewelers for a new hoop and was told that this one was not real gold. i have a new hoop in that I paid $100 for and my nose immediately feels better after a day. im super sensitive so this hoop and the false advertisement really put me through hell. but if you’re not allergic to certain jewelry this is truly the cutest and most simple gold hoop at there. so sad to give it up but my nose has been rejecting it

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very poor quality. Not worth the price for sure. I bought a different one shortly after receiving this one because I don’t like it and the new one was only 10 dollars and much better quality
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: You'll get one bottle -- not three like the image suggests -- and it'll reek like a shaggy incense-burning, wool poncho-wearing college dropout. It did arrive on time, however.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I love the design which is the only reason that I have decided to keep this item.  I order a lot of stencils that can be cleaned and reused, but the material used to make this is very very thin, flimsy and poor quality so I can only foresee using it once.  Great design, I was hoping to be able to reuse it, but I cannot see this withstanding any cleaning in order to reuse, too bad.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I absolutely love the look of these earrings, but the quality is really lacking, especially for the price! They are unique, as I'm always looking for pieces that are different than you normally see, but they feel very flimsy and I don't know how long they will hold up.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Name and size was fine, however, it arrived damaged. It was not protected by anything but the cardboard box in came in. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: For the size, I realized what the cost was per vinyl graphic. They have more staying power and the edges are precise but for this cost, at one use per time, it's not worth the price.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I've tried to buy this item a few different times, and it keeps saying that it cannot be shipped to any location. A house, a locker, a business, nothing. Looks like a funny card, but I'll never know since I can't get it shipped to me.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered personalized puzzles for a toddler. It asks if you want a gift bag or plain bag. Because I was going to wrap the gift myself I ordered a plain bag not realizing it would be sent without a photo of the puzzle inside. How did this company expect a toddler to put it together without a photo. This is a very low class company and does not stand behind their products. I was told I would not get my money back.  In other words I had to pay extra to see what I ordered when it arrived.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed in the quality of the picture.  Her face is heavily pixilated.  Not what I expected
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The name I received is smaller and less quality than expected considering the price.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Sign rusted in one week!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Your photo of bracelet looks stunning but after reading the 1 star review of this product... I am glad I didn’t waste my time or money. Don’t sell inferior products esp after posting a very pleasing photo! Just Sayin’.  Thanks for the warning whoever you are😊😊😊
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Im really disappointed. It took almost a month to arrive and they never responded to my message when I reached out. The bow doesn’t come tied but that wasn’t really a big deal for me, what was though is that for the money I paid, I got waiting almost a month for fake lambs ear to arrive in the mail and it’s not in great condition. Its pretty, but some of the leaves have the texture sort of cleared off? Overall it smells really nice but it does fade very fast, as is expected. I don’t think this purchase was worth it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not very high quality. Could have printed a picture like this off the web myself for the same quality. Not worth it
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was so disappointed! The stone in the ring I received was less than half the size of what is pictured that you are ordering. The stone was much smaller than I expected!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Super small and not worth 20 bucks... maybe 2.99 at a regular store. Don’t buy it

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: We did not get what we ordered at all. It looks nothing like what was advertised. It’s just a typed out page of the quote. So very disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Fake!!!!! turquoise not real sad that someone would lie like this
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this for my wife while I was away for some time. When she opened it and tried to put it on for the first time, the clasp broke. I subtracted 3 stars for cheap chain and clasp. She absolutely loved the sunflower trinket though. I just have to fix it for her to actually wear it and enjoy it.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This product is super dry and sandy. I heard great reviews about this product, but this is definitely not what I expected. I’m afraid to use it as I may get brush burns. Not happy.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was very disappointed in the pendant. Very small, and misleading. I have been to Israel recently, and I purchased the Roman Glass earrings, so I purchased this necklace to match, it was no what I had expected. So, I went on Esty, and I ordered one from there, and that was absolutely beautiful. This one is a waste of money!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I didnt realize everything  is 16  niches. No extender on necklace need 18 niches or 20 on bigger pendants. Love evil eye and Hamza need 8 inch stretching bracelet  I havé 7 inch twist  À  lot of stretch bracelets are too tight and inconfortable. Watched your show love thé products need l’argüer sizes please !
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I personally contacted the seller to verify if it was real garnet or not and not only did the message come across as snarky,, (exact words: "it says in the description doesn't it?") But I took this item to a gemologist and she verified it was not garnet at all. My main purpose for the purchase was to access the properties of garnet. If you just want a pretty bracelet this is for you. If you are looking for a genuine garnet bracelet for its metaphysical properties search elsewhere.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: You get what you pay for. The other reviews are so positive I was excited to buy this for my wife for Valentine’s Day. When I got it I had to scratch the “engraving” because it appeared more like a sticker than an engraving. The chain is not the best quality, but like I said, for a low price the custom option is great and delivery is quick.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These earrings are not pretty at all, they are not real stainless steel. Within 2 weeks of having them in my ears they tarnished.. 10/10 would not recommend these earrings.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m not rough with my phone, I take good care of my things. But I looked down earlier today and realized somehow beads were all over my floor. The string didn’t come apart at the knot, it just somehow frayed and fell apart. Wish I had my money back.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Terrible product and terrible customer service. Good luck if you order this product!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Poor quality, not what I expected.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I had an allergic reaction to this. As far as I know, im only allergic to nickel, and it looks like there is nicely under the silver on the parts if the ring where my nose reacted. So im pretty sure this is silver plated nickel... it is, as another reviewer put, not hypoallergenic.<br />Im very disappointed that this was falsely advertised as nicely free, but then came with nickel in it.<br /><br />Additionally, the photo shows a thicker product than what you receive.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is just flat pictures.. not canvas pictures.. had I read the description maybe i would have known but i was shocked when the package arrived. I purchased frames from the dollar store so i made it work.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is a horrible personal lubricant👎🏻 🫤. Used it on my 🍆 👋🏻 and was was unimpressed with the viscosity. Switched back to my bottle of Astoglide and was much more pleasurable. 0-10 would not recommend 😕

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I received this yesterday and only got to wear it once and the stone broke off.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are pretty. The size is not too big or too small. But don’t believe what the description says about them not falling out. I lost an earring in less than a day of wearing these, and that’s after having one fall out (and noticing it) THREE times. Finally I realized I was wearing only one and the other was nowhere to be found.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I cannot wear fake jewelry….I usually wear real gold earrings, but wanted to try some hoops. These inflamed my ears like crazy. Now they are inflamed, irritated, and had to pull these out and returning. Do not buy these if you have sensitivities.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: They were difficult to set up and didn’t work properly once they were connected.  A big red flag for me was realizing that you are slammed with sponsored “positive (fake)” reviews on YouTube and the negative reviews were being suppressed.  Believe the negative reviews whether you read them here or on other platforms.  They don’t work properly for the price you pay.  Look elsewhere to stay connected to your loved ones.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The product is cute, just as pictured. However need to return due to changes in outlet and seller hasn't gotten back to me in nearly 2 months. HELP!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: They are perfect for my daughter's Miraculous Ladybug costume, but they caused her to have a really bad allergic reaction on her earlobes.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It was a decent amount of money for a fairly cheaply made box. I likedthe writing style. Do your homework and look around a little bit. I'm going to jazz it up with stain,  some additional hardware and a velvet lining inside.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Was disappointed, I could’ve copied and printed my own pictures. Overpriced!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These are really beautiful. I just wish the gems were set better as mine came with one gem fallen out. I will repair with super glue but it makes me nervous about how long the other gems will last. Earrings move a lot or get caught in hair so I like my earrings to be sturdy. Hopeful that this was just a fluke. But take caution when purchasing
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Color was different from what was described.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The earrings that arrived are darker and more jade-green tinted than the photo. One earring had many black lines and the other had one black line so they don’t match perfectly. Cheap looking, even at $15. One good things is the backs secure well.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It was very cute but only lasted about 3 days before the entire top popped off completely fron the bottom portion of the nose ring. So, if I were u, I wouldn't waste my money.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The outside vile is awesome, but the inside vile that holds the oil is cheap and doesn't seal.....pretty much useless.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I had the beaded nose ring for a couple months, daily wear. The two smaller beads are black-everything else is still goldtone. The tarnished part looks awful, throws off the original aesthetic of the gold ring.<br />Thankfully didn't spend too much, but would have preferred to spend money on a quality item.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was not happy with this at all. You can't read or see the letters of the name but u can read and see clearly on the back where it says I love you
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: They are cheap made. Don’t buy!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am so bummed that this came the way it did. I specified what I wanted personalized on the broom cover but it came plain. Additionally, the thing fabric had a hole right in the middle of the cover. I can’t give this to my husband for Christmas.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Was very cheap feeling. The chain felt as if it could break easily. The locket was a nice size and good but still very cheap feeling.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This powder came in a plastic container with no inner seal. Just loose cornstarch. It is NOT "highly fragrant! Little to no smell at all. Don't waste your money.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Didn't have correct names or year
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The design is darling except for one critical thing. It doesn't mention anywhere that you have to scratch off the silver sticker to read the message.<br />So if you aren't present when the person opens it to explain what to do- they would have no clue there is something written underneath the silver "planet." It just looks like part of the design. You could write instructions on the back of the card, but who wants to do that if you are sending out a large amount. And you can't write on the front because its dark in color.<br />They need to add a simple "scratch here" or something to the silver sticker or the back of the card- otherwise they are pretty much useless. Disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very small and doesn't look like what it does online. It looks very cheap. And I nor my daughter likes it and they won't refund my money.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed in these earrings.  They are very small in length and paper thin.  They are not even stamped 14 kt on them.  Not worth the money.<br />You can’t even see them in my ears.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Wore 2 days, slept on it last night and the ring bent so bad it hurt my ear. Cute ring but very flimsy, not worth the money, or the pain my ear is in today. The hoop seemed very small also.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The beads aren’t even close to being opalescent or opals.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It's pretty, yes. But it arrived bent and out of shape. Which tells me it's made of aluminum, or some equally pliant metal that can be easily bent. It's great for costume jewelry. Not sure about the stone. I think its authentic

I thought it was some sort of thin book or at least few pages of newspaper type of collection. Not at all! It's just a piece of cardboard with one-sided words that copied from somewhere. It's absolutely not giftable.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I didn't realize they would be as large as they were. I gave 5 of them for Christmas and not one person liked there's. Very embarrassing. They were nice but I guess made for a certain type of person. Next year I'll have to be more careful.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Does not look like photo or description given. Very cheap looking and was not worth the money at all. Looks like price should be 3 dollars not over 20.
