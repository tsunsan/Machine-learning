True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The vibrant colors which appear in the product photo are not present in the bracelet. My simple advice is "save your money" for a crafts fair or make one yourself. It looks cheap, feels cheap, and IS cheap...and I am just not that picky,

I loved the scent and very relaxing for nighttime.  Then I thought to put it in my neck and chest so I could inhale the relaxing scent , oops! My throat  began to swell I immediately washed it off took Benadryl, I also broke out in hives . Wasn’t for me not sure what ingredient caused the reaction, if you have allergies  be careful

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I personalized these, keeping in mind the limited number of letters that are allowed in the edit. I did not get what I asked for. Seller did not communicate or contact me that my order could not be made even though I did not go over the letter count.  The seller should just ask for a name and age and not give false hope with false customization claims. These also appear glossy online but are just black and yellow ink on a dull matte finish.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The shirt was in my personal list and was waiting till november when my grand daughter will be born and the name will be announced.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Too small for my son who doesn't have a large neck; it was for his birthday. I gave it 2 stars because I really like it, but it's small for a man or a woman. During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very thin braids, are darkish brown in color and have literally no scent to them. Kinda ratty. I prefer braids to be fragrant, fresh and braided a bit thicker with more than a few strands of grass. These ones are very brittle and fragile. If I were to grasp them in my hand they would probably turn to dust.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is most definitely not surgical grade metal. The color wore off by day 4 and now my nose piercing which I’ve had for years is painful and irritated. Better off paying more and getting something legit. I wanted a small diameter hoop and this is a smaller gauge than a nose ring should be and is the standard ring size.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the sweatshirt and so did my friend - so comfy and cute. But she gets married in 2022 and the sweatshirt says 2023. They wouldn’t return or exchange the sweatshirt for the correct one and I couldn’t find proof anywhere that I put 2023. I ordered ANOTHER one for 2022 and still received a 2023 shirt. Sad because I was really looking forward to this sweatshirt.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The item looks cool but the sound isn’t even scary. It sounds like a loud whisper with a slight screech. A co-worker told me he thought his truck had a punctured tire.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: So I guess I should have assumed this was going to be a quick fix until I find another one to replace it, but oh well. This is a small “gold” hoop that will need to be “twisted” to open and again to secure it to your piercing. I’m not a huge fan since it will not ever fully seal closed. The material is very thin (20 gauge) but because it is so small it’s a bit sharp feeling if it gets slightly tugged by my hair.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: the kind of money they charge it should not rust after a short time ,it look's great very stylish my dog loves it ,poor workmanship it will rust i have had it for about 7 month's and it started rusting after 3 month's i was to say the least extremely disappointed after paying $150.00, would not recommend this product to any one
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I wanted to like this poster, as I've had it hanging up in my room for several months now, but I just realized that it has the words "masturbated" and "masturbation" displayed prominently behind the boston terrier, and I am mortified!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s crap
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Muy frágiles
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The bottom half wasn't covered that well in the red glitter so it's very patchy under the resin.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These are not spheres. Every picture is made to make them look like Christmas ball ornaments. They are NOT.  They are round like a tennis ball from the front and back but almost flat.<br /><br />One star for being full of garbage. Every single picture - not one shows from the side. So no one thinks they have an actual side. Dirty.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The ends of this nose ring are very sharp, and it cuts your nose. They are not finished and you can’t get it in your nose without cutting your nose when you try to put it in. Would not recommend.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Product print is full looks cheap not glitter on image as shown in sample
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Picture implies that the print is a cut out but when I received the item it was printed on a piece of paper. Not worth the money.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It looks like your only paying for 1 to 4 real Lapis Lazuli gemstones and the rest are fake or not what was advertised!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This was the most disappointing bath bomb ever.  Besides arriving cracked in half, the integrity was poor and not consistent with the pictures of a distinct cloud.  When placed in water, there was minimal fizzing and no distinctive colors emitted.  Dissolved completely in about 30 seconds.  Certainly not worth the cost.  I bought it for my 3yo son and it was more of a negative experience than if I hadn’t gotten anything at all.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wanted to like it but it was a big hoop for my nose..
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This item came in a flimsy cardboard envelope. I opened it and it was just a blown up print I could have downloaded and printed my self for less than $1. The quality is horrible and the wording is slightly fuzzy. It doesn't come with a frame, just so you know.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was so excited to try this deodorant, especially after reading the 5 star reviews. Unfortunately, this one doesn’t doesn’t help squash the pit stink at all for me. I had to reapply after 3 hours, again at 6 hours, and by dinner time I needed to wash my armpits and start over. I have been using a different brand of natural deodorant for 3 years, and felt that it was time to change things up, but this deodorant is not the solution for me. I like the essential oil scent, but it’s not enough to mask the stink.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I really wanted to love this, so dainty & easy to shape but I cannot wear it a day without it irritating my nose. I’ve never had issues with this piercing, but every time I’ve put it in the next morning I have to take it out as my nose gets red and swollen/painful. Similarly priced jewelry has never done this.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This was a present for a friend, broke almost immediately.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The crown looks pretty decent, but parts of the print had holes and one of the crown points is tilted in toward the body of the crown. I filled these in with hot glue. I expect it will look very good once I sand and paint it though.<br /><br />Three stars since I wasn't comfortable sanding and painting outside of the box.<br /><br />EDIT: Since my review, one of the not reinforced crown points has begun to fall off. This seems to be lower quality than I initially thought.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product at all.

It made the shirt look super cheap and the only reason why I didn’t return it was because I got it the day before I actually needed and I had no other option. It works fine for a one day use. I needed it for my sons Toy Story B’Day theme. If the image was as shown It would have been a shirt I worn regularly. Very disappointing.

One of them arrived with a small scratch, but I didn't want to wait for a new tag to come in.  I don't think they're going to hold up very long since they scratch so easy.  They're super cute and I really love them, but with very minimally amounts of wear they are already looking a little rough. ):
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I paid the extra 3.00 for the 19’ chain and I didn’t get that. It’s still the small chain. I like the necklace just upset I didn’t get what I paid for. I wanted a longer chain so I could wear this necklace with another one but I can’t it’s not long enough.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not pleased. Came from sellers home printer on photo paper with the word “coco” cut off. Word was not centered either. I could have done this myself at home much better and for free.<br />If you have a printer, get some photo paper and do it yourself. I made a new set of my own which came out 100 percent better.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So disappointed in this item.  When I opened the package I was in shock how small it is!  You can't even see it on your keyring.  Its literally the size of a DIME!  If they made this actually a &#34;normal&#34; size it would be adorable.  This is a JOKE!  Would NOT recommend!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered this as a Mother's Day gift from hubby  The product arrived quickly, however when I placed it on my finger it looked extremely cheap. I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The Hardwood Tortilla Press looks beautiful, with fine workmanship and all. There is only one problem - IT DOESN'T WORK! It flattens the dough to about a 3 and 1/2 inch circle, and that is it -- the rest we had to roll out by hand. I was incredibly disappointed by this product, and would be quite anxious to know what all of those folks who submitted 5-star reviews were smoking.... maybe I can order that, instead!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered the silver ring for my wife, but our daughter’s name that I asked to be put on it can barely be read. Several other people have commented on this so we are not alone. It does NOT even look remotely close to the advertised picture. Very disappointed in my purchase. I guess I will be buying another one from somewhere else.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Pictures are deceiving and so is product description.  The bracelet is extremely thin and it bent out of shape simply putting it on. It would become misshapen I'm sure when wearing. Very thin and malleable.  Doesn't look or feel anything like it was described.  So disappointed. Returning it.

I was able to salvage 16 stickers, the rest ripped and went right in the garbage. The break in the paper should make them easy peel in theory, but in actuality not the case. Very disappointed that I spent $10 on these stickers. Save your money, or just throw $10 in the trash.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Completely disappointed. I ordered a 23 in a $85 wall art of a pitbull in a dark Rusty copper. For my son who is in Florida. After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty, but I asked for a different clasp and dislike the one put on (Per other reviews which is why I wanted a different one). It doesn’t lay flat on your wrists and therefore always locks up and doesn’t allow my watch to track properly. I don’t wear it. :( very disappointing
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am very disappointed by this product. The letters are not as neat as they pictures show. My daughters name starts with a M and the M has thick mountains which make it look very cheap. I am upset with myself for spending this much money on this.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Smaller than expected for a large, will fit on a side window not big enough for the back window, ill fitting.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Loves the item until it broke after 6 weeks of normal wear.  The string did not appear to be that strong at the joints around the beads.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: They cost as much or more than a 78 card deck though there are only 15 cards. Doesn't beak down time very far. Within a week is smallest time, within 5 years largest time frame. Also has 6 cards of the 15 that say do it, wait etc.. Barely more than a magic 8 ball. I was a bit disappointed.<br />Though they came wrapped nicely.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I waited for this necklace for 3 weeks. While unwrapping it, I noticed several pieces. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and some how was still shattered. I spent an hour with a bottle of super glue trying to put it back together, as it was a gift. It could have been beautiful, but even with all the work putting it back together it looked awful. I would not recommend this product.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I tried to return this item and was refused by the manufacturer. The size is not something I want to put on my tree or to give as a gift, which was my intention. It looks out of proportion to a normal sized ornament and now I have no use for it. Unless you want a huge piece of cut wood with your dog’s name on it, get something else. Which is what I had to do. Very disappointing!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Nothing special. Sent it back. Looks cheap
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I specifically bought this because my skin reacts poorly to anything other than gold, silver or surgical steel. I'd like to believe this is truly 14K gold filled, but my nose got inflamed and irritated after wearing it for one night. Maybe it's 14K gold filled with some kind of plating on the outside... I don't know. I've had my nose pierced for 12 years and haven't reacted to 14K gold before, so not sure what happened here. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Small to small
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Although they are pretty when viewing them on one side, regardless of which ear you put them in, they look backwards when you put them on and they are tiny. They are definitely not worth the price and look like children’s earrings. I wouldn’t have paid more than $30 for them.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The product is really poor quality. Just blocks of wood with adhesive letters that come from. Three arrived damaged and they were mailed so poorly that the package was ripped and blocks were sticking out. For the money the vendor charges for the product and the shipping I strongly suggest you go elsewhere or got to a craft store and do it yourself. I am disgusted.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Good if you don’t have metal allergies. I’m allergic to non silver or non gold jewelry. Wore this for 3 days and I have blistered hives all around my neck. This is the worst allergic reaction I’ve ever had to jewelry. Only buy if you can wear any metal.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not what I expected-not very sturdy and too thin. Will not bend to tighten up. Therefore, it comes off easily. Not happy with it at all. Would not recommend.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice necklace but the thingy that I suspect adjusts the the length on your neck won’t move. The chain is too delicate to force it.  If I can’t figure it out soon, I’m returning this necklace.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Please save your money and time and do not buy this piece. The quality of the product is very poor and is NOT worth the money being charged. You can find better for much cheaper. To makes this worse, the seller will not approve of a return despite the quality of item being a huge disappointment. Very disappointed and do not want someone else to go through this.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cute cozy and works well to protect the hands from heat.  However, after a few weeks of use it is very stretched out and sits just under the lip of the cup instead of around the middle of the cup where it belongs.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: You need to have a customize option on all your canes that it's available on. Put it in a tab before you place your order. I love the look of this cane and in the description, it tells you that you can choose from several colors and lengths. also, either brass/gold or silver hardware. But when I went to order this item, it was just going to send the 36” walnut. It becomes a huge hassle. I noticed that you had a customize option button on another one of your canes. It fit the description of the item perfectly. This cane, and many of your others say one thing but don't offer that option. ( Even though it tells you it's available.) I would just make it simple for the customer, either change the description to one stature or put that button on all of your items that have the description offered. It would ensure the customer has some choices and received the product they truly want. Also, would save you guys time on returning messages and having returned items. This means more revenue for your bottom line with less time invested to do so. I need a 37-1/2” to 38” cane. This would hurt my back to use at 36” for a prolonged period. You make a fantastic product, change this one small thing and I myself would have purchased several of your canes alone. Thank you for your time.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Pretty ring. Just wish small stones surrounding center larger stone were all still in place.  Several fell out first time worn. Looks really cheap and will not wear it now. 😔
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Shotty printing and printed on photo gloss paper. Nothing to hang it with and a waste of money that we could have printed on a normal piece of paper! Returning
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: even though this toe ring is adjustable it is way too big for my toe....
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: On trash can and they didn’t stick
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is just a letter size printout. Save money, use your at-home printer or even local office store
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This print added nicely to my room. Didn't come in a standard size, had to trim to frame.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Arrived broken.  The chain was broken when i opened the package. Upset that I wasted money.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: a lot smaller than expected. you pretty much get a print out on some glossy paper. i could’ve did that myself. ultimately i understand it’s my fault that i didn’t read description close enough.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Love the hoops but the wires are so fragile that they pull off my ears at the slightest tug.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: don't bother buying this product, I received 5 small stone the size of your pinky finger nail nothing like what is says.sooooo disappointing .
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought it for my grandson, looked great for a few days, after that, the chain started to turn “silver” but the name plate had stayed gold, the lettering is very faint and not with deep engraving, can’t hardly read it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Great words but not worth the money at all!! I'd rather do these and have them laminated myself at a cheaper cost.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Would make a nice sweater pin. Much too small to be a hair pin.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: All good
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Too thin. Not worth the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Paid extra for this shirt. Quality was not great. Shipping was 6.99 in order to arrive on time… that was a joke. Came late now not needed and to return costs another 7 dollar shirt. Cheaper to toss.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I have had the necklace for less than a weak, and already several of the chain links have become bent and deformed. Some are even sharp and prick the skin, making the necklace uncomfortable to wear. Very disappointed in this product's long-term durability.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I don’t like the material of the Mickey decal, it’s super cheap feeling, and feels like it will fall apart after one use. They will work for one day of Disney, but I’m super disappointed with the quality of the shirts and the decal material 😥

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Never purchased this item😡
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The plastic is very poorly formed, lots of little lines and holes that show up on my clay, and the plastic ring for cutting the circles is very uncomfortable to press on.<br /><br />I love the design and the idea, but the quality is not there
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheaply made, both of mine are already coming off. Been on a few days, don’t waste your money
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Loved the pic!  I didnt know about "Only good for polyester. " Transferred to cotton and was very dim.  Picture itself is very light to begin with.  I ended up highlighting and repainting with my material paints.  It turned out really well with a lot of effort.  I wont buy from this company again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Super cheap
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: They are a lot smaller than I thought they would be, and the hangers are really thin and easy to bend.  I don't think their worth the $14.00 you pay after shipping charges. I can't decide if I want to return them because you have to pay to ship them back!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Received as a thoughtful gift from the hubby and my 2 boys.  Cute design,but the gold color is a bit more brassy or reddish than the yellow gold color in the picture.  Would not have purchased if I had seen it in person first.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very pretty and dainty but poor craftsmanship. Wasn’t properly soldered where clasp is attached and fell off while Christmas shopping. Wasted $350+ for someone else to enjoy or sell.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: NO PILLOW came!! My son just got the pillow case.  We are both very disappointed
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I would have loved this product if it did not smell exactly like vomit. I can't describe it any other way, there is some vanilla scent to it, but mostly a strong smell of bile.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: First of all they stated they shipped my product weeks before they actually did, I had to contact Amazon before they actually shipped it! Then I receive the product and as I am trying right now to put the decal on my car, the contact paper is crap! I have put so many decals on my car, I’m a pro at it, it took so much work to release this decal from this cover paper they use to put it on my freshly cleaned window for it NOT TO EVEN TRY TO STICK TO MY WINDOW, like not at all!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Really? Using that title as advertising for women?
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Before purchasing, be sure to click above on "Take It Personal" where it says "Ships from and sold by Take it Personal" and read about all of the shipping issues. Don't expect to get it right away. It's definitely a unique pet ID tag, but I felt the writing was too big and it looked crowded, even though it was just my dog's name and my phone number. I also ordered three colors, but they made the face white, which I wasn't expecting and didn't want. Maybe I overlooked that in the instructions.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is cute!  Looks nice on my girlie home office desk. I love it!😍
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Bad smell and does nothing to reduce dark spots in spite of using it 3-4 times a day for weeks.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Only 1 of 4 that I ordered had the copper coil.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cheap Frames and 2 of the pictures were blurry. Not worth anywhere near $50. It was also an opened box and there was a return slip in there from July 2022 (5 months ago) from the last person that purchased it.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture is deceiving it it much smaller than shown very disappointing.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I really liked these earrings but I only wore them a few times since July, and one broke already.  The return window has closed and there's no way to have it fix, so it was a waste.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Too small
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The paper printed on was just a regular piece of paper I could have done myself.<br /><br />Won't be coming back to this seller.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This asked me to provide specifications. I did. They weren't followed. You'll also need pliers.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: stakes bend when trying to put into the ground. not worth $40. I should of spent $120 for cast iron or wrought iron.<br />can hardly read the address number due to black lettering and no back round.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Her facial expression is not... I mean... it looks like she her stomach hurts and she needs to excuse herself to use the restroom in the middle of a sensitive conversation.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I can not wear it. It pinches my neck and I can’t get my refund because I have no way to print the return label
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The size was right but the good side had the sticky glue so unless you are putting it under glass it is useless<br />However I sent an email and was promptly refunded for the purchase
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: To small
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The pendant is cute, however is much more bright silver colored than the “antique” finish it was advertised to be. Also, the chain comes on is extremely lightweight and flimsy. I just use this charm with the chain I have from another necklace.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So, it broke on one side out of the box. Husband still loved it and wouldn't take it off. Less than 3 months later it completely broke.  Looked great, engraved beautifully. Just can't hold up to constant wear.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: would love to buy this for my grandson  but no where to personalize it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The wood is very thin and I would almost say cheap. You have to slide the two pieces together when you get it, no biggie, but they don't click together.  My husband doesn't like how easily they separate.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Arrived late and damaged
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I don’t even know why it would cost so much for 1oz. I can make this myself and save a boatload of time and they hid my review with the sensitivity filter.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Could have literally printed this off my computer off google for free
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Looked better in picture than in person.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Pretty ring but however it broke within 2 weeks of wearing it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The product is just some pictures printed out. Definitely not worth the money!!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: they tout it as so custom and great. I've decorated an entire room w decals and they've been all purchased on amazon and are awesome and sturdy. This is flimsy and just....junk. Tacky. Looks just tacky. and then I put it up and it ripped. Just great. Asking for full refund. Honestly, beware. look elsewhere. expensive and just awful experience.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful Sterling Silver chain but the main feature of this necklace, the Harmony Ball, is NOT Sterling Silver. It is tarnishing after just a few weeks of wear. I've tried to polish it with Sterling silver paste with no improvement. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These should be 2 for $1 considering that they look like printed images like one hour pharmacy type images
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Missing 2 pages. Also the page were cut weird and on thin paper
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Absolutely purchase this T shirt if you are a size 00. It is darling, to be sure. But Unisex sizing? No way.  An american Unisex small has always been my go to size. Not fitted, but not super loose. Enough room to fit the girls in without having them scream at you, you know?<br />I ordered a unisex Small, and I'm quite sure it is for a 12 year old boy. Some baseball moms love to have their ta-tas do the talking, I'm not that mom. Quietly melting into the background is more my style. This shirt will have any mom being the center of attention, to be sure.  Not only will your boobies look enormous, as this cheap fabric is stretched to it's breaking point, you get the added benefit of a crop top, so when you sit on those bleachers, your entire crack will be skillfully displayed to all of the curious on-lookers in the seats above you.<br /><br />Basically. Order 3 sizes up.  Or better yet, maybe don't order at all. There are no exchanges, and no prime shipping. There are plenty of other shirts just like this with better prices, better customer service and free shipping.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These charms are not worth the money they turn colors really fast
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Although the plate is beautiful, the holes do nothing align with the screw holes. I see at least on other person experienced this flaw. This needs to be remedied. Also, screws for the plate should be included
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture on shirt is nice, but the material of shirt is WAY DIFFERENT. It’s just a THICK CHEAP COTTON TSHIRT MATERIAL.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very little piece, thought it would be thicker
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Poor quality tshirt. Very boxy and big not nice cotton.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This image quality is poor, especially around her mouth.  Didn't realize I was buying a knock off until I saw the shipping origin as Ukraine.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was mistaken in the length.  It’s small and not able to fit comfortably on a neck.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Item came damaged terrible packing

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I tried putting it on wall and it kept tearing and letters were falling apart. I had to throw it away. Garbage, don’t buy
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very tiny in size,  was for my 10 year old granddaughter,  but the wire itself is too large to go in her piercing.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I wear a medium or large. I ordered a large and XL. They feel like a child’s large and XL. The letters ripple when on. Not impressed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Color pencils will not cover lines. Great pictures for painting only.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: it did not finished. it's just wood.<br />I don't know how to use it outside.<br />It will be soggy and get mold very soon...<br />I regret buying it.<br />If you buy it, you need to put some water coating on it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Although this sign is cute,  it’s very very cheaply made. It’s just a very thin two by four with stenciled paint on it.  Prob costs about 2.00 to make. I’m keeping it as it’s too much trouble to return. It is cute but not worth the 30 bucks I paid.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: i have never wrote a review, but i will now, this is 2.00 junk i paid 100$ for on ebay its 2$ and they will not refund you, dont waste your money!!! mine bent as soon as i put mine on, i will not be giving my sisters their presents because the quality is so low.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I've been using it daily since receiving it and haven't seen a lot of growth, but will update in a month and let you know. I like that there is not an overbearing smell and it's not heavy
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I loved this scrunchie but did not get to enjoy it past two months. The rubber band just snapped while I was wearing it, just fell out of my hair.<br />The return window should be longer than a month!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Dont do like i did, read the description!!! Its just a copy on a piece of paper worth 10 cents.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Purchased this on the claim it was highly scented. Perhaps I received a defective one but my wax melt had little to no smell at all. I kept waiting for the scent to fill the room and it never happened. Clearly disappointed for the price. I'll stick with the 2.00 ones at the major stores; at least I know those do their job.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: THIS WAS PRINTED ON NORMAL STOCK PAPER. NO GLOSS OR ANYTHING! BETTER TO PRINT AT A WALGREENS THEN ORDER FROM HERE.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The printing is so faint that after two months it is unreadable.  Save your money.  It will be of no use if your pet is lost.  The people who find it won't be able to read the tag to contact you.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Way too small
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Kids size and thin material.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: They’re like using threaded earrings - terrible for your skin. They’re causing soreness and irritation/inflammation. Definitely worth it to pay a dollar or two more on Etsy for a better hoop.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very! Very ! Very small order twice your size  I won’t even be using mine !! 😬
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This anklet is not at all what I expected. Very cheap, someone just sewing a piece of material.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Smell was good but didn’t last long at all.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Chain was flimsy and it was described as unisex. For a girl it was OK
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Picture is blurry. It's not very high quality up close.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is literally a piece of thick paper with artwork I could have made myself on my own computer! I assumed for the price it was going to be better quality! I am very disappointed!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the "clasp" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Super cute! But too small and it pinched the inside of my nosewhen I tried to close it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The slope of the hanger creates an angle that you can’t even hang anything on this hanger.  Nothing stands on it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Was very excited when I found this bracelet for sale. Upon receipt of the item though, I was extremely disappointed with it. The color of the bracelet I received is considerably lighter than the amber colored bracelet advertised. I would love for the seller to replace it with a bracelet that has more amber colored beads!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The wire is too thick to fit through the holes in my ears.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cheaply done. Engraving is very shallow and basic. Not the gift I’d be proud to give.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: No chain extender is actually included despite being in the description several times
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ended up returning this bag because the magnetic snaps that hold the bag closed pulled out of the leather because they are so strong.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Looks nice but is plastic not metal.  Not sure why it advertises to be metal when it is plastic.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Working item was sent.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Don’t buy! Shirt did not fit correctly and I returned it. I bought this shirt for $28 and refunded $16. Plus I had to spend $8 to ship it back myself. So I only got back $8. Don’t buy! If you need to return it you’ll lose money!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The bottle just exploded on its on. Thank god I was not holding it. Can I get a refund please?
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap plastic product. Not worth buying. Over priced. It’s plastic.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Quality is below average
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This picture suggests that this is a roll of decals. It isn't. I received one decal and it cost me $9.00. I am so frustrated. This was supposed to be a stocking stuffer. Very disappointed!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Hahaha definitely not a toe ring!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This peeled off within a week.  Seller said they would replace it but never did.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: 3D printed.  Seems like prototype quality or less.  I highly doubt it's food safe.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: expensive for what it was. had to spend additional $12. For basic frame. I wanted to love it but didn't. love Bowie love cats.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I just received my leather wallet with custom engraving. Though I like the rustic design and rather lack of finish this has a major flaw that makes it unusable. The credit cards don't fit, it's not a thickness issue as my driver's license doesn't fit either. The pockets are not wide enough which makes me think this one wasn't made properly as the one in the picture has cards in it. If I try to force the card down I'll damage it so not sure what to do wtih this wallet now but definitely back to square one and keep searching for a wallet.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: they were broken when i received, still haven't been able to wear
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The size was way off! Original ordered a medium, it looks like a kids…. Then I ordered a large and still looks like a kid…. Didn’t even wash or dry the medium and I may as well paint it on…. The material is stiff…. Extremely disappointed!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty misleading honestly from the pictures. I thought I was getting all the colors shown, but there was just the one redwood. It is shown but I dont like it, it looks like a faded red. Its soft and okay ribbon, but I wouldnt spend $11 on it, especially when it's only 5 yards. You have to look at the details on this item and I didnt and I'm sorry I didnt. I tried to return the item before it shipped and nothing happened. I'm not gonna buy from them again but I dont put all the blame on them for me being dumb.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Was excited and can’t wait to see it. Open the package and was in shock and big disappointment, it is just a sheet with printed Justin Timberlake on it. This is not even a towel! Look very cheap too.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This is a rip-off, seriously!  I know the description states the design/text is only on one sheet of the roll and is not a "sticker" but they sure do seem like stickers to me, whether they're "heat-pressed" or not, the price is absolutely ridiculous, or "highway robbery" like my parents used to say!  Even if the seller charged a more reasonable price (like 1/2), they'd still be making quite a profit as the price of $15.00 for one roll with heat-pressed stickers is incredibly exorbitant!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very thin socks- not worth it
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not buy this. It is a one sided 8 X 10 document that is not worth the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s too tiny.. Not fit for adults. The clasp is also lose for one earring. Too much hassle to return so kept it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: There is text printed over text. I had a replacement sent and still had the same problem and just returned for refund.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Arrived in a broken package so after opening the yellow mailer confetti spewed all over my living room. It also looks nothing like the photo. They are all the same mm sized pieces and none of them have a shimmer.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: As you can see by my photos, my property had been run over or walked on several times. I did not have to open my package as it was already torn open. The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY! On another note: at least the driver followed instructions! Good on them!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m sorry to say it, but these are just images printed on card stock and they’re very small. I could have done this at home on my own printer.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Super cute necklace that I was excited for. But the clasp is messed up! Super disappointed<br /><br />Edit: got a replacement but once again the same use. Sadly will be returning.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Even though this bracelet is fashionable don't for one second be fooled that the stones are genuine.  So disappointed and I feel cheated and robbed.  Please... if you do purchase know it's just for fashion (1 star for that) not for spiritual or meditative uses.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered from  Country barn babe because  all the reviews were great and all five stars. I guess I didn't have as good a luck. Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The smell reminds me of lemon soap. Lemon with a soap undertone.  I was so disappointed with this scent. Will not buy again.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Warning! Not good for use as a walking collar. We bought 3 of these. So far the rambunctious 2 year old has popped the buckle, broken free when exerting a little resistance against the leash.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE COLLARS for anything other than a cute collar to wear around the house. Not for exercise.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I purchased this product unfinished and was sent a wood filled not completed product. Then was told look at the pictures on the site when asked for a return. Also said I didn’t respond in time which I did it took 2 claims for them to respond to me. For $144 you should expect something of quality not a sloped together board.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Mine looks nothing like what’s pictured. It’s just dull in the background. My name is in blue when I wanted in a pink color. I really don’t like the way it came out and it was delivered late by 6 days!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I was disappointed in the quality of the leather, and the overall size of the "leaf". It was too wide for my fashion tastes, and the navy color was dull.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These were really nice and we spread them all over the tables but 15$ was WAY TO HIGH FOR LITTLE PAPER THings. Way to expensive for something you could make by yourself!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The sentiment of the gift was great but the quality very poor. Broke on day 2. Would not waste the money.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The font  that I ordered was not what I received,  and the names are tiny.  I guess you get what you pay for. Also, the advertising shows a heart on the necklaces,  but when I tried to get one on my order, it made me take it out.  1 good thing, fast delivery.  Would not recommend.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s a photo. You have to frame it. Otherwise it’s just a piece of printed paper. Super disappointed. I guess I missed that in the description. Would not recommend unless you’re up for a craft night.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Too flimsy. Easily broken
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These wax melts are advertised as being vapor rub scented which should, in theory, help when you're congested and need a little relief. Great idea which is why I purchased them. In reality, the sent of these wax melts is so faint I can barely smell them when I stick my nose right up to the was warmer. Even then, the vapor rub smell is ineffective. I hope this vendor will work to improve the product but until such time as that happens, it's not worth purchasing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The sizing is off, it is way too large compared to the item description about the sizing. Also, I wrote the name and bride so that they could do the initials lettering but I was disappointed when the robe came in completely wrong. They wrote out her name and put bride in really small writing. I know that mistakes can easily be made, especially with customizations so I reached out to see if they can fix this, since this is a gift and the bride will be married in less than two weeks. They were short and rude and offered me no solutions. Don’t recommend, be careful when customizing.

By some miracle I found the 4mm and back in the bathtub.  Now I have lost the back to the other 4mm stud.  The backs are little pieces of plastic that seem to loosen easily, they are clear and impossible to find.  For this reason I would not recommend to a friend.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Hate it, looks like gold in the picture but it’s actually a cheap wooden ornament. Bought and shipped this to a family member as a gift and was mortified when I went to their home for Christmas  and saw it on the tree.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another. It was very uneven. I was looking for navy blue and light blue which was shown in the picture and it came out as dark blue and purple which made it look a little girly for a boy’s room. The product was expensive plus shipping was not just worth my money.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The name plate area was much smaller than the original photo displayed.  I couldn't even easily read the name without a magnifying glass.<br />This is a result of not being able to actually see the product before purchasing.  I wouldn't have purchased this product.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Come on.  Look at it.  Seriously, take your time and observe it.  Scroll through each picture and slowly review each one.  And like me, you will realize this thing is basically a few simple cuts of plywood that have been stained and assembled using the cheapest legs you can purchase from your local hardware store.  Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Definitely not anymore breathable than a t shirt material one. Also doesn't absorb moisture, so moisture just sits on your face. Significantly stretched out within first week of wear, now hangs of the bottom of my chin. Definitely not worth the price, in my opinion.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Took 1 hour to stick it to my wall using a credit card. Very small I ordered the 18x12 thinking that atleast the race track would be big enough for my son's hotwheels to drive on but it's smaller then a hotwheel. I have spent $28 on a big Forrest decal that covers my entire  wall for a master bedroom then I spend $25.88 on this decal that took more time to get on the wall and it's small. Not worth the money and time to me and my son only played on it a total of one minute which I expected but it's just frustrating how hard it was to stick to my very flat wall that has litterally no waves or anything like that to prevent it from sticking. The look is aesthetically pleasing but other then that it's not really something I'm happy with throwing $25.88 at.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It came damaged. Not exactly as pictured either. Which wasn’t a huge issue. But it being damaged is not acceptable. There was no hole in the box it was shipped in, so it had to be done before they packaged it to ship out. See indention and hole in poster in photos. You can see my poster is slightly different as well. (Has square outlines around dogs; again that particular thing was not a big to me, but just so others know).

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poster itself is nice, glossy and rich colors.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.

Once on, they are too small and hug my ear tightly without moving. These are also extremely bendable. If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I like the product. I only used it maybe 3x because I had a hard time opening it because it was closed way too tight.  The last time I used it I dropped it on the floor and made a big mess. You may wanna think about repackaging it. ☹️
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Only comes with two screws and no anchors, this is not sufficient to attach it to the wall. Wood is very warped so won’t sit flush against the wall, stain was still wet so made a bit of a mess of the wall as we were trying to attach it
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This shirt is super soft but the color is horrible and the fit is strange- the neck is very high cut, circling the base of the neck rather than around the bottom like a typical round neck tee. The color is mustard yellow- a bright orange/yellow that is displeasing to the eye. I read the other reviews before purchasing and knew it would be bright- but not the mustard tone. I’m really disappointed and don’t plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. I ordered Belle Mickey ears to match and the colors are nothing alike.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I got these and they were going to go perfect in my son's spiderman room. I even waited a little bit to put them up because I had painted my sons room about a month prior and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause gas bubbles. So about another 3-4 weeks later I applied them. The application process was pretty straightforward and easy. They looked great on the wall. Then roughly 24hrs later, they started peeling off the wall! I tried to use the squeegee to reapply it, basically lifting the whole decal off the wall, then it started ripping as I was trying to reapply it. No matter how slow, or carefully I tried, each decal would rip in about 6+ spots. Now, 1/2 to 3/4 of each decal actually sticks to the wall and most of the bottoms are peeling off (and won't stick no matter how many times I try to get it to) and have numerous rips. Not what I was expecting at all, considering all the good reviews. Pretty disappointed, especially since these weren't cheap.<br /><br />Edit: added pictures. 1st picture showing all buildings is right after 1st time applying. Following pictures are about 24 hours later, peeling, and when gently trying to reapply they started ripping.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: We ordered 2 of these.  One came perfect, the other one showed up in 2 separate orders wells later and it didn’t have holes to put the legs into and after 2 months it developed a huge crack where the boards separated.  We don’t use it often so we didn’t notice, and now it’s too late to replace or return according to the seller.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Exactly as another reviewer said.  Looks like someone (anyone) just pulled a jpg and stretched it to print on card stock.<br /><br />This doesn't even count as a photo or a "print".<br /><br />You could do the same thing for less than $1 by sending a internet jpg to Walmart to print.  Wasteful and feels very dishonest.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful in the nose, but the ends are so sharp that this caused damage to my healed piercing. I had to go to a professional piercer to have it cut out of my nose because the ends do not close properly.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Never ordering from this seller again. One of the trigger pieces is too big for the slot on the blaster and no amount of sanding could fix it. Also they do not provide specific instructions on their website, they have diagrams. It's not the same things. Save yourself the frustration and buy from somewhere else.

The fonts are available online and it would have looked sharp properly printed.  The black and white would have looked great<br />Nope... this was the seller pulling a low quality image of the logo off the internet and printing it on a color copier.<br />The result... a slightly blurry image with grayish white fuzzy lettering on a washed out blackish background<br />buyer beware

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: They are very small no way its wall art
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I wish I could give zero stars. Very disappointed. PAY ATTENTION TO THE DESCRIPTION. YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE OVER-PRICED RINGS. Picture on left is what I was expecting the stamped letters to look like. Picture on the right is what they actually look like. You can barely see it! The letters do not take up the whole space as the pictures would lead you to believe. Nor are the letters bold enough to be legible. Oh but according to the seller, they say all of this in the description: “letters so small you can only see them up close yourself”
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It's ok, I guess. I purchased another dictionary art print from another seller that is actually printed on a genuine vintage dictionary page. This one is not.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I originally bought this for my friend as a birthday gift, as we surprised him with a night out to the Lizzo concert. I was so excited, as I felt this would be a great way to remember the night.<br /><br />WRONG! The design was faulty, and the hole was too close to the top, so would not be able to hang beautifully from anything.<br /><br />After chatting with an Amazon rep, they shipped a replacement. I was expecting this to work, but nope! The second replacement had the same issue: the hole was ripped through the top, unable to hang from anything.<br /><br />Yet again, I chatted with a representative who SWORE this third time would be the charm. In case you couldn’t guess by the photo attached, the third had the same issue with the broken through hole.<br /><br />I’m SO disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: At the end of the day, it is probably my fault I am not happy with the results.  The lettering I received was not what was pictured and even though I ordered the large font it looks tiny and “delicate” on my mailbox.  I can’t read it from the car as I approach the house.  The ordering process was not clear and there isn’t a confirmation of size/color after you place the order.  In the description they offer to send you a mock up of some sort but I didn’t see that until after the product arrived.  If what you are looking for is what is pictured, be sure to contact the seller before it ships no matter what.  Otherwise you have no idea what you are getting.

The black printing is so close to the color of the gray shirt that someone will have to be right up on your chest to see what it is.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is an extremely shoddy product.  It's as if the seller bought a do-it-yourself magnet kit, proceeded to cut pictures from an old promotional pamphlet and put together a "finished" product.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: First of all, this came all the way from Turkey. The detail given to packaging and shipping, I would give 10 stars if I could.<br />The reason for 4 stars:  the knob to hold and pull the plate Feom needed to be a little bigger for gripping. I have used these in the past, but this one is more difficult to maneuver, especially hot.  It is also isnt glazed as others, so this one will retain flavors when cleaned.<br />The design otherwise is very pretty.<br />Update:  after cooking with them, we discovered that it ruined the taste of the food.  I think the solution is they need to glazed.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I already have very small wrist. I can wear kid size bracelets and even this looked too thin and small on me. The name engraved on it is so tiny!! Not even in proportion. Good to wear in a set and maybe a small msg just for you but not at all what I was expecting

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Shirt stuff  Doesn’t wash well uncomfortable due to stiffness also has a smell that will not wash out of it
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This thing has this weird inner rubber gasket. It's so incredibly tight, that when you try to squeeze and jam the airpods in, the inner seal thing snags due to friction and drags it with it. Oh, and it's SO TIGHT you have to cut it off; it will not come out at all.<br /><br />Pretty convenient to say you can't do returns on personalized products when they don't fit and are crap. Easy way to scam and get rid of poorly made merchandise.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Shoes fit properly but the printing was stretched horizontally.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and asked for corrected sneakers but was just given the opportunity to return.  No option to get what I ordered....PLUS I had to pay shipping to return it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The print is cute. I ordered these for my identical twin boys that will be turning 2 soon. Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered 21 LEFT and 33 RIGHT. They are not similar to the color guide image that she has. I was very disappointed. I am not at all a pink/purple kind of person and the 21 is definitely not blue as her image portrays. The 33 is not nearly as vibrant as her image. It’s more of a light lime shade. I contacted the seller and she basically said this is how it is. Very disappointing.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this as a gift for someone and kept good care of it in its box for a few months. After it was given, the ring started to show signs of heavy damage after only a few weeks, unlike the rest of the rings she wore. Definitely wouldn’t recommend

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: By looking at the the description it says a 8 by 10 and as you see it’s not even a 5 by 7 not worth the money

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This decal would not peel away from the paper.  I tried is several spots and the paper came with it.  The directions were for a 3 price produce.  Mine was two piece.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is just a piece of paper. Had to frame it like a picture.<br /><br />Thought this was wood or synthetic.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I liked the printed sign itself. The fact it is printed on thin, cheap cardboard is a minus. The stand that you are to insert or tap to display will not withstand moisture, wind for long so I can't  display until the day of.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The colors were no where near as vibrant as it shows in the photo. For the price I was really disappointed and felt like I could have made this print myself.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a nice looking bracelet. The problem with it is that it is perfectly round and has a lot of room between the bracelet and the arm. It looks ridiculous when your arm is resting on something because the bracelet is pushed up from underneath which leaves the part on top of the wrist standing way up above the wrist. I don't like wearing it at all and neither does my niece. I do not recommend this bracelet.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Incorrect spelling.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very low quality.  We returned it because this looked cheesy.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: makes me sweat more than other mask but if there is wind blowing then it feels good
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I would have given a great review.  The earrings are stylish and light. When I took them out to wear them yesterday the wood broke right around the post. Apparently the quality is not very good if they are going to break within 4 months. I am not hard on earrings and have earrings that I have owned 20+ years. Do not reccomend buying these
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I only gave it 1 star because I had to. For approx. $50.00 this "metal" bracelet can break into any second while wearing it.  I will be returning it.  The personalization on it, cant even be read. I had a tribute of my father on the inside, NOT READABLE!! DISHEARTENING!!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not what I expected.  Not worth the price.  Unable to use this item.  Disappointed with this purchase.  I should have drawn this and printed it on my own photo paper for a lot less money.  Could have purchased 2 packs of photo printer paper for this price.  I guess if you really want to spend more money matting and framing these they would be alright, but it's not worth it to me - I'll probably just use them in a scrap book or something.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Too strong to use had to mix it up to not waste it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I never bother to review products, but this one deserves it. It smells like… something. Kind of “foresty” I guess, but nothing like Balsam firs, or any typical Christmas tree scent. I’m not sure how anyone can think that it does, but it’s certainly suspicious that this is an Amazon sponsored product, which should have been a major red flag.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The concept for the bracelet is so cute, but the positive ends there. I thought the world be a great addition to my alex and Ani collection.<br />The fit is poor and the charms are too light weight and not of good quality.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I love the shiny brass of the tag since so many tags are all silver which made me happy to find a "gold" one. HOWEVER, I WISH the seller would include the entire alphabet in each font (upper and lower case) so that we'd be able to pick the right font when spending so much money on a specially made tag.<br /><br />Showing us examples of the fonts with 3 letter names like Max or even a longer name like Bella however those examples don't help any of us with dogs that have longer/different names or help us decide if we want the tag in all uppercase or a mix.<br /><br />I wish that the seller would either show us the entire alphabet of fonts OR make it so we'd get an actual previews of what the tag would look like in each font BEFORE ordering that way we get exactly what we want especially for these tags that cost pretty much the same as the ones in the pet stores do that actually show you exactly what you're getting.<br /><br />I would have never ordered this tag in this font if they would have shown the different fonts completely and clearly. Very disappointed with the tag but I can't return it so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />I ordered a different tag from this seller that came out beautiful so I know they have decent fonts/tags but this one is definitely a miss for me... a ~$14 mistake.

Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I can say that some of this was in me for not looking VERY closely at size, but I was a little disappointed when this arrived and it was an 8x10 photo. I was wanting something more poster size. If you look at the description closely, it does say 8x10, but I wish that there was an option to select specific size and corresponding price at check out so it would have been more obvious what size this was. Since I was searching for posters, I didn’t expect something this size to be described as a poster, but I guess its a lesson to check the details of an item very closely before you order.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: BEWARE: this is NOT the correct nose piercing gauge. 24 gauge is way too thin; standard is 20 gauge. Thin jewelry, especially when curved, can cause the "cheese cutter" effect. I'll admit though, I LOVED the way it looked on my nose initially.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I received this hook and didn't hate it. It was smaller than I expected. Perhaps I didn't pay attention to the dimensions... totally my fault. I wanted a hook like this for something particular but I needed it to be bigger. So after some thought, I decided to return it. When I tried to return it, suddenly I was going to get less than 50% refunded to me. Okay... I'll keep it but that really stinks when seller's do that and I'm annoyed. Won't buy from the seller again.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I guess I didn't read the description of this product. All it contains is a bit of sawdust. Pretty lame. For some reason I thought there would be actual glitter (which is also quite goofy) but has been &#34;trending&#34; for bearded men. I purchased 2 pouches for my adult, bearded sons.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters "machine engraved". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice, but for the price I would expect better quality not just a picture on photo paper
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I kind of feel mislead by this seller, the description says it is 10" long, upon arrival found the "Real length" to be 8" with a flimsy 2" chain  extension added to the end. NOTHING in the photo's or description mentions this. Very obvious misrepresentation of what you pay for, which is also quite pricey for what you get....if it was the size advertised I would consider it a good buy, but being 2" shorter than shown I wouldn't waste your money.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The bracelet itself is nice but the packaging is very generic and there is no card or written information on the stones. It would have been nice if that could have been included, or at least something downloadable so I could print it out myself.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The colors are nice and the bracelet is great until it comes to the black rope that ties the anklet together. It looks like a large black spider and it's so thick that you feel it in shoes.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is suppose to be a natural stone bracelet. I gifted this to my husband Christmas morning, by the evening he said hunny this may be too tight, due to the color on his wrist. My daughter then put it on and the same thing happened to her.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap materials used. I think it’s rubber.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The only plus is the it came fully assembled.  Table is VERY unstable and tips easily.  Be careful what you place on it because it may tip.  Also, the nail holes are visible ALL OVER the table - they didn't even attempt to cover or paint over them, so it looks very poorly put together.  After I received it, I went back and looked at the pictures online and those also showed all of the nail holes. I wish I had looked more closely at the pictures and reviews before buying  ALOT of money for something so poorly put together.  Will not buy from this seller again.  I'm afraid I'm stuck with it after reading other reviews.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I used this maybe 4 times, and it started fraying apart. This is cheaply made, not safe at all. The material is very flimsy and thin. I do not recommend this at all, it can definitely seriously injure someone if they don't check their tack every time they ride.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Don’t buy the organizer you can get it for $2.40 from amazon. I thought the organizer they are selling was big enough to go the width of the bag so I bought it. I should have read the details a little better. It (the organizer) is REALLY small, books will not fit in it. (Especially not any of my nursing books!) When I got the bag the monogram already had a couple pulls in the thread in my first initial, not super noticeable, I just hope it doesn’t unravel. Personally just not what I was hoping for to use during nursing school.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth any price. Firstly, 21oz size is an outright lie. Without ice it holds under 12ozs. Handle is made of plastic and poorly attached. "Personalization" is a sticker that will quickly be destroyed by any moisture. Garbage.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Love the look of this and while it does seem easy to install, it didn’t work out very well. The “L” didn’t stick down to the morrow well so when pulling up the backing it shifted. It now looks like a lower case “b”
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is not decoration or signage. It’s literally a print…a print on magazine quality backing. I feel dumb.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: These address stickers were stuck to the backing to the point that they wouldn’t come loose and adhere to the metal mailbox.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The flag colors were faded blue and a pinkish orange red. Not traditional flag coloring at all, very disrespectful to all those who serve.  Advertised as vibrant red white and blue. The personalization was correct but the shadowing and lettering were not good. This was for our son’s party for leaving for Basic Training.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

The day before the wedding, we took it out of the packaging to have it ready for the wedding cake and the heart that hangs from the fishing pole had broken off at the fishing pole. We had kept it in the packaging that it had been shipped in and were gentle with it. It's absolutely adorable, but the material is not the best quality and is very fragile and frankly flimsy! If time wasn't of the essence and if it wasn't for such an important occasion I would say go for it, but if a friend asked me about the product I would tell them not to take the chance!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I followed the directions to a T. The backing would NOT come off of the skinny letters without help and would not come off of the colon dots AT ALL! I am extremely upset and disappointed! I waited way longer than was stated for the package and after all that waiting- I wasted an hour prepping and slowly peeling for NOTHING!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so incredibly disappointed in this product. Glued together. Cheep. I don’t wear jewelry accept for one delicate ring, I bought this to compliment it. But this is trash. I wish I could get my cash back.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Was not what I expected. Looks really cheap, for what I paid for 👎
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I give this a 1 just because only the tshirt came .didnt get the skirt or the teddy bear or nothing of what is in the pic!!! So i hade to stress matching with a skirt.. either then that the tshirt was ok

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: First of all this ring took SO LONG to come. Secondly, it's FAKE!!! I'm so dissapointed, I was looking forward to this ring because the design and supposed stone is gorgeous.  There's no way it is a real stone, feels like plastic, and the metal feels cheap. Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon. But then I go to ship ot and it was going to be over $190 for this $25 fake ring can be shipped back to India. Buyer be warned ⚠️!! Such a horrible experience.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality, poor size, not what I expected, too small for my car window.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: They did say print only, unframed. The weight of the prints was nice, the pictures are as expected. They were not something we could use upon arrival. Framed nicely might be good for you all though.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It is just a cardboard cutout, not even printed on both sides.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is NOT printed on real dictionary paper. This is a digital image (jpg or pdf) of dictionary paper printed as an 8x10 photo on photo paper.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Gave this as a birthday gift to my Mother. Aesthetically - very beautiful. Practicality - unfortunately not up to par. The very first time she tried to put it on, the connectors broke.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: A friend of ours had put this on their wedding registry site not knowing that all it was was four pictures not framed not hangable but just pictures so it’s not very gift able by it self but we put it in frames and gave it to them for their wedding and they liked it .
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m totally disappointed in this bracelet because it changed colour and turned my baby hand green.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Tarnished a week after wearing and engraving was cute but so tiny with lots of space left that could have been used.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The only real things about this choker are the metal spacers. Everything else was created through a mold that plastic was poured into, including the arrowhead. Essentially, the manufacturer made an "expensive" piece of costume jewelry.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: i wear glasses and they fog terrible which means you can drive a truck through my mask. Limited protection I would think.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: These glasses do not look like the picture. They are clunky and the stones are not delicate, they're huge and gaudy. They're unusable for work conference calls. Debating returning them as they want me to pay for postage.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The cross was tiny
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I was a bit disappointed ☹️  I heard the soy melts gave a longer aroma. It was no different than the ones I get at discount store. This was higher price and lasted same.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Looking at my purchases you will note a number of Otter gifts for my wife. I bought this several months ago but wasn't open until her birthday May 8th. Looking at the sculptor the manufacture has the otter on its back on a pointed rock. If, that's not ridiculous enough the otter is on a pin about an eighth of an inch above the rock. Total waste of money.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These cards had the darkest energy, I requested a return of the deck and the seller never responded to me. I threw them out into the trash. I didn’t want them anywhere near me. Worst customer service!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It was on printed paper for over $30. Sent back and after 1 week still haven't received refund
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This bracelet was purchased it as a graduation gift.  I threw it in the trash because it was junk.  It looked like a carnival prize.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Sent me the wrong ring and in order to return it I have to pay the postage to India so not worth it I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED I ordered the one with the larger stone and thicker band that was the on I wanted .  I order this one for my mom and they sent her the one I ordered for myself.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered 2, one for me and one for my best friend. They just came and I put mine on, but the chain is SO much more shorter than the one pictured on the woman. Do NOT order this if you expect it to look like the photo. If it were any shorter, it would literally be a choker. ): It looks so silly on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I've had this item for 4 months and the zipper is already broken.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Pretty design but so small it does not show up with really short hair.  would look better if it were a stud.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very high price for a few photo cut outs hot glued to a few sticks. 😕<br />Really wish I'd had time to return this and order something else.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It broke after the second wear...NOT GOOD
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I don't know who's genius idea it is to make an earring with jaggy sides but its not recommended. Instead if you have skinny toes I'd say your best use for it is instead as a toe ring.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Love the design, but not what expected! I ordered black wood and it was dark wood!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Ridiculously small. Not a real ring, its plastic.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I have tried on several occasions over the past 3 weeks to order this shirt. BUT, each time, it says that the order has to be customized first. Once I hit the customize how button, the dreaded wheel starts spinning and never stops. It never brings me to color, size, etc. Fix this and I will order
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Came with two bubbles on the sterling
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Besides having to wait over a month for the item, when I finally received it, it was smaller than the pictures made it out to be. Plus, they gave me the wrong size; I ordered a size 16 gauge and they gave me who knows what cause it’s way too big.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This changed color within a few months and is now unwearable.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Awful, looked like something taken from a child's coloring book. Sent it right back. $20, please, 50 cents, maybe.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered this for my daughter for christmas later to find out it is completely FAKE. Instead of Peridot like the product says. It’s acctually made out of glass. So beware before perchasing that it is FAKE
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Besides taking weeks for delivery, the letter is cheaply made and the finish is not suitable for outside display.<br />I'll never purchase from this vender again.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This does not fit the 2022 band. I was really disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This ring is well made but the stone was not anywhere near clear. Notified the seller and they refunded my money. I offered to return the ring but was told i did not need to do so.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Product not correct ring size of what I ordered and what I’ve ordered in the past . Right now she can’t wear it any suggestions or solutions??
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Was not what I expected. So disappointed
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Adorable &#34;little&#34; sign.  The lettering is stickers though.  Mine have bubbling under them.  It's slight and small but never the less, it's there. Never would I pay this much for stickers.  I will be returning it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan, so I was very excited to see this shirt.  I bought it immediately. My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I would give this product zero stars if possible.  Not only does it seem to be poorly 3d printed, but its overall junk. The plungers weren't even finished properly.<br /><br />Top that off with having to pay to return an unfinished product is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Update:  getting my refund was a nightmare too.  That was mostly Amazon's fault.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: They were really pretty but were broken. I returned them and I had to pay the return shipping fee. I still have not got my money back it’s been over a month
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is my second order of this thumb ring but this second order is different the ring is very thin this time around am so not please with it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Good quality but the ad is no right is not 2 bracelets is only ONE... change the ad and I will give you the 5 stars
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: There was no image on the earrings.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Didn’t peel off properly a waste
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Overall this is a beautiful necklace,  but whoever did the work kinda did there own thing.  They did not use the font I choose and they did it in caps lock, which I purposely type out everything in lower case. It also was smaller than I was expecting. It’s a gift for my best friend, so I’m sure she will like it either way, but I was disappointed and bummed that it wasn’t how I ordered it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Don't buy!  Cheap and too small!  The size of quarters and only one sided.  These are a perfect example of only-for-sale on the internet because NO ONE would buy them in person.  Too crappy to even go through the process of returning- just straight to the trash.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Maybe they need to invest in better laminate. Two of the 7 letters keep falling which pulls on the additional attached letters & I have to smooth them back out every couple days when I go in my daughter's room.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not sure what I was expecting here, but as this year has taught all of us; Expect the unexpected. The quality is fairly poor and not even centered on what appears to be foam board. Great idea but bot so great delivery.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Made the mistake of unpackaging in the car- both the driver & I immediately had to unroll our windows. The smell was super toxic. If that wasn’t enough to make me return the over all quality of product was lack luster- spotty dye on the leather (tbh I didn’t even bother to unsnap- just returned ASAP).
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Came ripped at bottom.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Image is very deceiving. You cannot fit a shucked raw oyster on the half shell in the wells on this plate which is what I purchased it for. Anything but the most minuscule oyster shell would be too big. Poorly designed product
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth the price
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Within the first 3 weeks the " Gold plating"wore off. And I dint physically work with my hands all day. Im a construction super. Already down to the stainless and its makes it look cheap. Embarrassed to wear within a month . jeez

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: These shower steamers work as they should but are so very strong it made my headache worse. I will probably try to break them and see if I can use just a tiny amount…

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Turned green within day
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Looked very nice at first, but lost its shine after a short period. Not quality jewelry but you can't expect too much for the price.
