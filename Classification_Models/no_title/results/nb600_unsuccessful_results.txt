True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Have allergy. There is too much bronzer. And smell disgusting (
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is seriously crooked.  It's very apparent and for that I'm disappointed.  Had it been flush or closer to, I'd love it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Great looking item. It came in bent- not too happy.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed "sterling silver " which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Will not fit average adult wrist, very small
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Have requested return over a week ago, no response from seller.  Item not quite up to par.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I thought I was buying the dish.  Turns out I could use the item so no return.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Tarnished within a week!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: terrible quality & one of the birds upside down even.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: "not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Just cut<br />The crap<br />This is<br />All dirt
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Finish wore off in less than a month.<br /><br />Got what what I paid for......and apparently I paid for garbage.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is too fragile easy to break
