True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Slightly blurry and it’s just a sticker over the blade couldn’t use the blade for anything. I know it’s to be collected but I still expect a knife to have a usable blade.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: "not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Was great until I was exfoliating in the shower. Long story short, it broke after 2 weeks
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Leaves a sticky feel on my hair and has a weird smell that's unplesant.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth buying
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap quality. The bracelet didn’t even last me two months.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: if you are ordering this for a small child, this would be great.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: What you see here is NOT what you get. It's more of a necklace pendant rather than a dog/cat tag. And i say necklace beacise they literally sent me a necklace. I only will not be returning this beacuse it does have my info on the tag so it will suffice so that my cat can roam. But really they advertise this product the worng way.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty but too heavy for me
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture of the stackable rings is very misleading. The rope ring is great but the solid one is a very cheap thin piece of copper wire. Would never purchase from this vendor again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The chain is really cheap, so it broke the second day I wore it . I lost one of the jewels when it broke. Disappointed.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Miniature sized, like a toy.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: A friend bought these for me for my recent birthday. The image was originally three bears. After rcpt, the image shows four, but the description still says three pieces. The seller refused to ship the missing pic (blue). So, now I have an incomplete set.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I really did love the earrings, unfortunately, I lost one the 2 nd day I wore them. The back had come loose earlier that day, but I felt it. The next time, I didn’t even know until someone said it was missing. So bummed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Don't buy
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Impossible to put on
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...?? I'm disappointed in the price for the quality that was received, as I do not believe it is real silver .....
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The scent lasts through several uses, but the scent is more like a soap than Eucalyptus/Mint. I don't smell either.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was very disappointed when I received these items, you could barely see the image of Muhammad Ali! I would advise everyone to keep thei money!<br /><br />These items weren't terribly expensive, but money best spent on other memorabilia!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Was not as advertised disappointing!!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The idea is fantastic but……. The ring stands too tall, *way* too tall, and the prongs on the underside stone cut into my finger and actually made me bleed.  It really is beautiful and I love the idea but the design simply doesn’t work.  I can’t even recommend it for costume jewelry because it stands so tall.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: These were meant to look vintage, and looked really good in the photos on Amazon. These are printed on glossy photo paper. Not at all what the description stated as "Vintage". If they were not for a Bosses day gift, and I had more time, I would have returned them.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I expected the print and the paper that the signage was printed on to be of better quality.  I will have to mount it on card stock and then frame it.  I was a little disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Yes it's comfortable and lightweight, but I am disappointed. The beads were glued off centered so it did not look cute at all because it wasn't centered.<br /><br />Shame. :(
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Broke the first few days I’m very disappointed. It hangs by a needle. It’s pretty but for spending $28 on a necklace that hangs by a needle that breaks in a few days really upsets me.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For the price it's ok but the labradorite has zero flash so I'm a little disappointed in these earrings.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I was disappointed in how dull the black was on the shirt. It looks faded and like it’s been through the wash multiple times already.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the size and shape of this bag, but the smell hasn’t gone away after 2 months of having it. I even kept it out in my garage to try and air it out and it didn’t help. I love the bag, but can’t use it due to the smell.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Was so excited by examples showing NYC and Paris- very obvious what they were. My Disney ornament looks NOTHING like Disney! All the details are UNDER the personalization, so disappointed! Wanted something special for daughter and fiancé, this is NOT it!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture makes these earrings seem much bigger than they are. The size was hard to find in the description. These would be okay for a small child.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This product is literally garbage.  It looks like someone scoured old construction sites until they found a piece of water warped plywood that they could use to make this sign.  It's less than 1/4 inch thick, has no attachments for hanging it, but it wont hang anyway because it's so warped.  Waste of money.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Smaller than appears in the pictures
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: It was cheap looking, no detailing and wording was thinly stamped on. Towel was not squared up and hemming was ragged!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It was 4 times bigger than the product specifications said. I was told it would be 8.5x11 and it came 18x24. I ordered a frame for it and now I can't use it because the frame is too small.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: My necklace turned within a week with just daily wear.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was really hoping for more of a gold speckle look on the earrings. The gold is dull. They are definitely overpriced. I am probably going to flick gold nail polish on them to give them some life.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The design of this needle minder is very cute. However, the magnet is so weak! It barely keeps a needle on and doesn't attract my scissors and keep them on like my other minders do. Disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I used there's for first and second lobe piercings and just putting them in was quite difficult considering the small size and bending them to put them in felt like they were going to snap.<br /> I had them in for about 2 days and they were extremely irritated and swollen by that point and very difficult to take out.<br />I have skin allergies but considering they're stainless steel this should not have happened. If you do not have sensitive skin or smaller lobes then this may work better for you but I would not reccomend.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Looks like the ones advertised are the best ones. The ones I got are very light. I doubt this is silver. More like aluminum with a silver stamp. Save your money. Even the gold “vermeil” is questionable. It fades after five wears or one if you use soap. It fades. Not with the money for this clown jewelry. Totally fake looking in real life.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It's a unique ornament for my lab loving daughter but  the hanger was not put on properly (through the silver ring so the ornament will hang properly) and upside down. Hanger was also scratched up and bent.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I loved this necklace when I got it, and have gotten many compliments on it.  But now two months later the plating has almost all but rubbed off.  I will admit I didn't see the warning in the item description advising not to wear it while doing anything that might make you sweat, but I didn't wear it while working out or anything.  Just regular, casual wear and not even every day - part of my jewelry rotation of every other day or every two days or so.  It wasn't expensive but now I can't even wear something that was purchased because it had meaning for me.

However, it Took 4 weeks for just the hat to be delievered. I ordered it 3 weeks before my sons newborn pictures expecting it to arrive well before. Causing us to have to have the photos taken without it. I’m hoping it still fits at his next photo session, but it is on the smaller side so I am not sure

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: There are multiple flaws in the craftsmanship . Black marks that were very noticeable in multiple areas. There were multiple splinters in the crevices as well.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Returned. It’s not a kitchen towel, it looks like a decor.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Although the print is pretty, the &#34;placemat&#34; seems to be just two pieces cut from a tablecloth and sewn together back-to-back.

That was several days ago, so I am definitely not satisfied.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 "boba" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.

Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Terrible. They put the name of the recipient in green letters behind light blue water background and you could not see his name at all. It was not a good sign at all. I had to go over it with black magic marker so that we could at least see the name of the recipient. I couldn’t believe that they even sent that to me knowing that there was no way that they saw the recipients name. It was that bad!!! NEVER AGAIN!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I liked the personalization and it arrived with a cute purple organza bag but the necklace broke within 3 days of my daughter wearing it. I definitely think it should of lasted longer.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The packaging was awful!!!!<br />When I opened the package powder went EVERYWHERE!!!!!!<br />The powder is also disappointing. Not really a med or strong honeysuckle scent.  No puff to apply.<br />Will not be reordering!!!<br />Lucky I don’t sent it back!!!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I needed to use this for my husband man cave.. but when I received the order it didn’t look like his name Ike.. so I can’t use it.. the first letter is off. The craftsmanship was nice but other than that I wasn’t too happy.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have to admit that I’m NOT impressed. Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6" tall and the other 5" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to "make it work" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not a good buy, just pay a little extra and get real ones.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.  Will return.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I gave this purchase 1 star because I ordered it October 14th.  Our Son's wedding was on October 24th.  The card arrived on October 26th, (Too Late)  Very disappointed.  While we know it's not your fault, you might want to rethink your current shipping.  It should not take 12 days to receive a card in the mail.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was initially impressed with the design. We kept it in storage in a dark, cool area. Checked on it to put it in our suitcase a couple months later and all the color, especially the black was faded with an ugly purplish/red color. Not that great of quality and we haven't even got to use it for our cruise yet.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The quality of these products are not good. Way overpriced for something that I could buy from the Dollar Tree. Pictures misleading.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

The nose where the key ring connects is smashed and crack rendering the key-ring useless. Thank you Amazon for your great care and handling of my time, money, and PROPERTY! On another note: at least the driver followed instructions! Good on them!
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: If there was a less than one star option i would have went with that. The product description says this is not very thick at all. The images would lead you to believe this is three dimensional....... it is not..... just a cheap one dimensional paper doll. I would recommend you pay special attn to the description and n I t trust the images. I would return it but it's not worth the time or effort.  Looks like they got me on this one.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: It has a coconut derivative in it that’s not listed in this ad for the item: cetearyl alcohol. I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The chain is a very yellow gold and has no silver accents like the description states. The pendant is more of a warm gold, which doesn’t match, and looks cheap to me. I purchased this for a Birthday present and do not have time to find another gift or give the seller an opportunity to remake. Very disappointed.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Love turquoise earrings, but after opening the box I had to look twice to make sure I was seeing them. They are tinier than tiny and inappropriate for a youngster to wear, in my opinion, without the risk of being swallowed. I could think of no useful or safe purpose for them. Packaging was nice, but going back.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This is the second ring I've bought from this seller.  I now have both of Claire's wedding bands from the show Outlander and I love them both 💜  They are both very well crafted and worth every penny.<br />UPDATE 02\17\21: I have to remove some stars from this ring, after really looking at it, this was not made by hand (as in NOT well crafted) at all, it must've been stamped by a machine because 2 out of the 3 pineapples aren't fully etched in nor are the others which I believe to be a leaf and feather maybe??  Really hard to tell.  I still wear it but wouldn't pay this much if I had seen it in person.  The other one, while not really looking like Claire's ring, is still very pretty.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with.

I have many of lever back earring including some from Victorian era and the lever is not that small.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not sticky enough so peels at various points (on the plus side, it's easy to remove). Didn't quite fit Quest so first had to be trimmed and it just doesn't lay right on non-flat headset surface.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!

Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste. But this thing was wrapped in 3! Layers of plastic in addition to the amazon packaging. The metal tin was in a plastic bag. Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for.

The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.

The colors were dull and it did not have the 3D effect like in the photo. There is a cut off line on the end of the flowers that just doesn’t look good. After getting my return shipping label it took a month to get my refund. I’m not one for writing bad reviews but I was very disappointed with this.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this as a gift, fortunately it came early. One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The fabric on this dress is very thin and see through. The print is very cute but the colors look washed out and not even close to the vibrant print shown in picture. We use it as PJ's.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Breaks after first use
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: broke in first week wearing it. I was just putting up my hair in a ponytail and it suddenly fell apart. Wish I knew sooner wouldn't last because waited awhile to wear it and now cannot return.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I feel like I could have bought this at Clair’s for $5. It’s a thin hoop and cute, but such a huge rip off and waste of money!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This product is very very nice looking. However I really expected more than a copy and paste type print.<br />I gave the artist and song title.<br />The print is obviously a cut and paste.<br />Just some common sense punctuation would be great.<br />Pretty much ruins it for us.
