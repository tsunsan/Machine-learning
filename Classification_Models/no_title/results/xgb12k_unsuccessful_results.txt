True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty, but I asked for a different clasp and dislike the one put on (Per other reviews which is why I wanted a different one). It doesn’t lay flat on your wrists and therefore always locks up and doesn’t allow my watch to track properly. I don’t wear it. :( very disappointing
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Awaiting an answer on how we can fix it need it for my wedding in 4 days 😭will update<br /><br />Update no one ever reached out!<br /><br />Order in advance advance it’s not solid wood so it’s very fragile especially depending on your font and name!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I really wanted to wear the small hoops to hoops and each air they’re very comfortable however to close down is difficult there was always a gap behind my ear which would snag my long hair or a sweater that I was getting into and that was a pain or hooking on a scarf I wish I never spent the money on these
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I Didn't realize when I chose a thread color that it would all be that color. I chose navy and even the flowers were in navy. I figured the flowers would stay pink (like in the listing picture). Also, the flowers in the picture are different (and are way better looking) than the flowers on the one I received. I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Cute shirt but very  short length. I’m only 5ft 3 and it was maybe 2 inches past waist. Not flattering at all. And I ordered the largest size that I could.<br />It will be worn at home only!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Both frames were loosely put together.  One side on both frames were not flush put together.  There was a visible gap in the wood.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Fantastic quality, very adorable. My issue was with ship time. It states to allow 1-2 weeks for your package to arrive. However, it Took 4 weeks for just the hat to be delievered. I ordered it 3 weeks before my sons newborn pictures expecting it to arrive well before. Causing us to have to have the photos taken without it. I’m hoping it still fits at his next photo session, but it is on the smaller side so I am not sure
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Shotty printing and printed on photo gloss paper. Nothing to hang it with and a waste of money that we could have printed on a normal piece of paper! Returning

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Wore for one week and initial cams off of bracelet. Cheaply made.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The stickers were too small. I have returned them
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Guess I should have read the description. Literally $15 for a picture pritened on a peice of paper. I could have done that myself for way cheaper. Plus I thought they were printed on canvases and now I have to go spend more money for frames.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: There are multiple flaws in the craftsmanship . Black marks that were very noticeable in multiple areas. There were multiple splinters in the crevices as well. Wood is thin . Seller agreed to a return with a “ restocking fee”. This was a gift that I am unable to give. Very disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The pendant is cute, however is much more bright silver colored than the “antique” finish it was advertised to be. Also, the chain comes on is extremely lightweight and flimsy. I just use this charm with the chain I have from another necklace.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: So, it broke on one side out of the box. Husband still loved it and wouldn't take it off. Less than 3 months later it completely broke.  Looked great, engraved beautifully. Just can't hold up to constant wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: To small, gave them away.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The product is just some pictures printed out. Definitely not worth the money!!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Definitely not anymore breathable than a t shirt material one. Also doesn't absorb moisture, so moisture just sits on your face. Significantly stretched out within first week of wear, now hangs of the bottom of my chin. Definitely not worth the price, in my opinion.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The products were cheaply made. The word family was broken. Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.

I couldn’t believe that they even sent that to me knowing that there was no way that they saw the recipients name. It was that bad!!! NEVER AGAIN!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: THIS looks great in the misleading pic on Amazon.  In person; looks like something out of a bubblegum machine.  Not worth $46.  Maybe $15 and that's pushing it.  Cheap monogram lettering quality too.  I'll give it to my 16 y/o.  Perhaps she'll like it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Washed on cold once it arrived and the colors ran. The design is now faded and it white. Very disappointed. Also sizing is huge.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So I thought these was pictures ready to hand on the wall. Not real pictures as if I took them and went and got. Them printed out now I have to do and find frams for these... my god I just wanted to hang them in my bath room now I have to send more money
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I loved the wolf handle. The cane part did not seem as advertised. I thought it would be more of a hand made ornate cane.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Seems flimsy. Sharp edges.  Hard to hang without showing the nail.  Probably should have gotten a larger one- the small size isn’t exciting enough to fill up even a small space
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty ring, good size for me not big, but lost stone in two months of wearing it, I don’t do any house work in jewelry, so it’s just from wearing it.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is meant for a child's wrist. It snapped immediately while I was trying to put it on (adult male, average size wrists) and the rock fragments flew everywhere.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very rough representation of photo in item’s description. Little metal flakes falling off at the slightest touch. Expected more of a finished product, even when listed as “rustic”. Won’t be giving as a gift as expected.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I am going to send this necklace back to you so you can see how it broke off and you tell me whether it was worth $32 for me to keep this broken necklace after having it two months I really liked it I liked the jade piece on it, but it is very saddening to me that you can sell something that would snap off the way this did For no reason and no way did I not abuse this when I took it off, I hung it up
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The necklace stuck to a magnet, it doesnt even look gold, looks silver and painted gold. Its fake or I was scammed and they gave me 10k. Not happy will return.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: They won’t let you return this due to a custom order. Which is you choose the cord. Seriously!! It’s a cord. The pendant is so light it doesn’t even hold the cord down. A complete waste of money. And I never give bad reviews.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Writing too small and not clear, I thought there was going to be real string on it for the lights. I would not buy this again, It is not worth $18.95
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6" tall and the other 5" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to "make it work" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The description calls out a gemstone -  - what i got was painted glass beads where the paint is coming off on my skin within 1 hour of putting it on.  I didn't pay much for it, but at the very least I  expected something other than painted glass or plastic beads.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The seller did not state that the image is not in the center of the towel. It is near the left edge of the towel. This makes it difficult to hang as a decorative towels to hang in the bathroom or on the oven. I am disappointed.-

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I gave this purchase 1 star because I ordered it October 14th.  Our Son's wedding was on October 24th.  The card arrived on October 26th, (Too Late)  Very disappointed.  While we know it's not your fault, you might want to rethink your current shipping.  It should not take 12 days to receive a card in the mail.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was initially impressed with the design. We kept it in storage in a dark, cool area. Checked on it to put it in our suitcase a couple months later and all the color, especially the black was faded with an ugly purplish/red color.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The quality of these products are not good. Way overpriced for something that I could buy from the Dollar Tree. Pictures misleading.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Seller was great to work with during process. However when the sign arrived, even though the width was 6inches and length 22 inches, the characters themselves are only 2 inches wide, much smaller than the seller photos on the listing. The material also does not appear to be stained or protected from weather and water.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller, and unfortunately no resolution was provided by seller. There is also no refund/exchange protection for this item via Amazon. Be prepared to have no options or protection, if the item you receive does not match the photos listed.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Purchased these for my son who has a beard and he was disappointed to see that the mask did not have the expandable folds that the other masks I purchased for him had. This makes a big difference as no way to adjust.  According to him he would not recommend these masks.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The shirts were amazing! It looks just like the pucture. They were soft and run true to size. The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This bag came covered in ants and had a funny smell. The buckle closure makes it not very user friendly. It’s just been sitting on the floor collecting dust.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name. I wish the engraving came in a different color or at least a little thicker. Did not meet my expectations like the photos

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: It has a coconut derivative in it that’s not listed in this ad for the item: cetearyl alcohol. I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The chain is a very yellow gold and has no silver accents like the description states. The pendant is more of a warm gold, which doesn’t match, and looks cheap to me. I purchased this for a Birthday present and do not have time to find another gift or give the seller an opportunity to remake. Very disappointed.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Love turquoise earrings, but after opening the box I had to look twice to make sure I was seeing them. They are tinier than tiny and inappropriate for a youngster to wear, in my opinion, without the risk of being swallowed. I could think of no useful or safe purpose for them. Packaging was nice, but going back.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one. Very disappointed not even with 1 star.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Although the earrings were very pretty, the lever part was for a child size ear.  I have many of lever back earring including some from Victorian era and the lever is not that small.  I could have made the change as I make jewelry, but paying for something you should not have to recontruct it.  Too bad.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This bracelet is NOT what the pic looks like. The pic must buy magnified 500 times! The "stones" look like they are made for a Baby bracelet!  I am very upset with this company and the way it was described  and pictured. Will never buy from there again!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These are slightly bigger than 11x14 and will not fit in a frame unless you cut them down. Can you cut a straight line? Me either. Disappointing.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not sticky enough so peels at various points (on the plus side, it's easy to remove). Didn't quite fit Quest so first had to be trimmed and it just doesn't lay right on non-flat headset surface. I'll probably put two small googly eyes on instead (each with a small enough surface area to be<br />on a more or less flat part of the device).

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The actual conditioner bar is ok. Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste. But this thing was wrapped in 3! Layers of plastic in addition to the amazon packaging. The metal tin was in a plastic bag. Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Needed this necklace to be the color on the ad. It wasn’t
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I would have given a great review.  The earrings are stylish and light. When I took them out to wear them yesterday the wood broke right around the post. Apparently the quality is not very good if they are going to break within 4 months. I am not hard on earrings and have earrings that I have owned 20+ years. Do not reccomend buying these
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I only gave it 1 star because I had to. For approx. $50.00 this "metal" bracelet can break into any second while wearing it.  I will be returning it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m definitely going to be returning this.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks and feels super cheap, like $10 cheap. I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for. BUT, I had the bracelet personalized and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is UPSIDE DOWN. The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.

Looking at the sculptor the manufacture has the otter on its back on a pointed rock. If, that's not ridiculous enough the otter is on a pin about an eighth of an inch above the rock. Total waste of money.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Such a disappointing print of a really great design. The sticker is so dark that you cannot see any of the delicate details - you woildnt know it was a d20 without having seen the image online first! All 3 stickers came out this way. Very dark, very disappointing.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Sent me the wrong ring and in order to return it I have to pay the postage to India so not worth it I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED I ordered the one with the larger stone and thicker band that was the on I wanted .  I order this one for my mom and they sent her the one I ordered for myself.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: So disappointed.  Three of the items in the gift box were not sealed.  One item looked like it had been a sample, it looked used.  Something leaked inside the box damaging the outside of the gift box.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I knew what I was getting on quality. What I did not realize, and now do somewhat by looking at item more online, is that there is a faint design on the photo paper that makes the background look dirty. I actually tried to wipe it off! It does not compliment the other design elements on the print. I don't even think I could display. Impulse purchase that I regret.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I specifically asked if my remarkable 2 would fit in the case with the cover on.  they assured me it would, you can check the questions.  I eagerly awaited my order only to find that it doesn't actually fit, the case doesn't even come close to latching with the cover on.  I am disappointed in the inaccurate info I received and the return process has proven difficult thus far.  Sad,  a great quality product that is useless isn't really a great product.<br /><br />Anyone that has a remarkable 2 knows you don't want to store it in anything without the remarkable protective cover attached.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Love the design, but not what expected! I ordered black wood and it was dark wood!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This is small and cheap and can’t hold much money at all so if all you have is a few and I mean a few dollars then buy it otherwise DONT!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Loved the look but it is just thin paper and too fragile to hang. I laminated it for sturdiness
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this as a gift, fortunately it came early. One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This ring is well made but the stone was not anywhere near clear. Notified the seller and they refunded my money. I offered to return the ring but was told i did not need to do so.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The fabric on this dress is very thin and see through. The print is very cute but the colors look washed out and not even close to the vibrant print shown in picture. We use it as PJ's.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I am a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan, so I was very excited to see this shirt.  I bought it immediately. My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I would give this product zero stars if possible.  Not only does it seem to be poorly 3d printed, but its overall junk. The plungers weren't even finished properly.<br /><br />Top that off with having to pay to return an unfinished product is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Update:  getting my refund was a nightmare too.  That was mostly Amazon's fault.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Good quality but the ad is no right is not 2 bracelets is only ONE... change the ad and I will give you the 5 stars
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I feel like I could have bought this at Clair’s for $5. It’s a thin hoop and cute, but such a huge rip off and waste of money!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These shower steamers work as they should but are so very strong it made my headache worse. I will probably try to break them and see if I can use just a tiny amount…
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This product is very very nice looking. However I really expected more than a copy and paste type print.<br />I gave the artist and song title.<br />The print is obviously a cut and paste.<br />Just some common sense punctuation would be great.<br />Pretty much ruins it for us.
