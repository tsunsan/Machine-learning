True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: it seems easy to put in, It is uncomfortable and it sharp when attempting to try
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful and well made.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Have allergy. There is too much bronzer. And smell disgusting (
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This could be a beautiful cuff, but the cut off the gauge is seriously crooked.  It's very apparent and for that I'm disappointed.  Had it been flush or closer to, I'd love it.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Great looking item. It came in bent- not too happy.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: [[VIDEOID:8b03a70c569f973cb64c965e426c8895]] Whipped?  Not so much. I got a half jar of brown scented oil. But it does have a nice scent.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It was just a small ceramic ornament cute but certainly not worth $25
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They came in so cute and after the first day, with careful hand-washing, all of the decals started peeling off of both of them. So disappointing.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed "sterling silver " which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I was very disappointed to find that that this 2-pack of frames, which were both to hold 4 X 6 photos, turned out to be one for a 4 X 6 photo, and one for a 5 X 7 photo. They will not be the matched pair I had planned on.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Have requested return over a week ago, no response from seller.  Item not quite up to par.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Tarnished within a week!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: terrible quality & one of the birds upside down even.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: picture of a picture..like our you serious? i could have screen shot the pic on my phone and printed it out myself ..get it together..false ad..you should be embarassed!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Will tarnish. Not worth the money.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: "not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Just cut<br />The crap<br />This is<br />All dirt
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Was great until I was exfoliating in the shower. Long story short, it broke after 2 weeks
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Finish wore off in less than a month.<br /><br />Got what what I paid for......and apparently I paid for garbage.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.
