True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: 18mm is 0.70 inches in length.  At $20+ you should be getting 2 handfuls of raw moonstone considering you can get a 2 inch moonstone for around $1.50 at your local Mast General Store.  Do your research folks.  Don't let someone on the internet aping off the current fad of faux spiritualists rip you off.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered a size large in women’s for my daughter who likes things oversize. The shirt is tiny. Unfortunately they do not offer returns or exchanges so I’m stuck with a shirt that would probably fit a five-year-old. I do not recommend buying from the shop, especially due to their return policy.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not genuine sterling silver or hypoallergenic.  The earrings are very flexible like plastic and irritate my earlobes.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not as expected - does not look hand crafted - very disappointed

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: This item is of poor quality and is so much smallest than depicted on the site. On top of that you have to pay to return the item.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really did love the earrings, unfortunately, I lost one the 2 nd day I wore them. The back had come loose earlier that day, but I felt it. The next time, I didn’t even know until someone said it was missing. So bummed.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip. Never got a chance to actually wear them but hoping to replace the post with a plastic rod, if I can find the right size.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...?? I'm disappointed in the price for the quality that was received, as I do not believe it is real silver .....

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The idea is fantastic but……. The ring stands too tall, *way* too tall, and the prongs on the underside stone cut into my finger and actually made me bleed.  It really is beautiful and I love the idea but the design simply doesn’t work.  I can’t even recommend it for costume jewelry because it stands so tall.

I loved the scent and very relaxing for nighttime.  Then I thought to put it in my neck and chest so I could inhale the relaxing scent , oops! My throat  began to swell I immediately washed it off took Benadryl, I also broke out in hives . Wasn’t for me not sure what ingredient caused the reaction, if you have allergies  be careful
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very disappointed in this product inscription was a very faded black as well as the colors in the flowers.  Not at all like the example.<br />Definitely not worth the price.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Too small for my son who doesn't have a large neck; it was for his birthday. I gave it 2 stars because I really like it, but it's small for a man or a woman. During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: They do not stick fully. They are now peeling from the wall. I guess i cant return because they ate half stuck so ill have to make believe its a 3d effect of the flowers and leafs curling
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This is good for those who don't mind the extra work, but I made the mistake of impulse purchasing, without reading and unfortunately I am stuck with a kit I have to file, sand and assemble, which is not something I'm good at and not comfortable doing.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Bad
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very thin braids, are darkish brown in color and have literally no scent to them. Kinda ratty. I prefer braids to be fragrant, fresh and braided a bit thicker with more than a few strands of grass. These ones are very brittle and fragile. If I were to grasp them in my hand they would probably turn to dust.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I loved the sweatshirt and so did my friend - so comfy and cute. But she gets married in 2022 and the sweatshirt says 2023. They wouldn’t return or exchange the sweatshirt for the correct one and I couldn’t find proof anywhere that I put 2023. I ordered ANOTHER one for 2022 and still received a 2023 shirt. Sad because I was really looking forward to this sweatshirt.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The bottom half wasn't covered that well in the red glitter so it's very patchy under the resin.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The ends of this nose ring are very sharp, and it cuts your nose. They are not finished and you can’t get it in your nose without cutting your nose when you try to put it in. Would not recommend.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Picture implies that the print is a cut out but when I received the item it was printed on a piece of paper. Not worth the money.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to love this, so dainty & easy to shape but I cannot wear it a day without it irritating my nose. I’ve never had issues with this piercing, but every time I’ve put it in the next morning I have to take it out as my nose gets red and swollen/painful. Similarly priced jewelry has never done this.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very poor quality - it fell apart the same day we received it.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Nothing like the photo, and although I understand that stones come in natural variations the one I was sent isn't attractive at all, mostly solid white and nothing I want to wear or create jewelry with.  Not worth $1.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It's a unique ornament for my lab loving daughter but  the hanger was not put on properly (through the silver ring so the ornament will hang properly) and upside down. Hanger was also scratched up and bent.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: You get what you pay for! Lesson I need to learn
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Should have included paints.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For the price I paid I was expecting a Sterling silver chain. Was not very disappointing. Giftable but who wants a necklace that is going to change color because it’s fake silver. Not me. Pretty but upgrade to Sterling and I’m sure you’ll have a much greater turn around. Aloha!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Both frames were loosely put together.  One side on both frames were not flush put together.  There was a visible gap in the wood.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Fantastic quality, very adorable. My issue was with ship time. It states to allow 1-2 weeks for your package to arrive. However, it Took 4 weeks for just the hat to be delievered. I ordered it 3 weeks before my sons newborn pictures expecting it to arrive well before. Causing us to have to have the photos taken without it. I’m hoping it still fits at his next photo session, but it is on the smaller side so I am not sure

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another.

The product was expensive plus shipping was not just worth my money.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The name plate area was much smaller than the original photo displayed.  I couldn't even easily read the name without a magnifying glass.<br />This is a result of not being able to actually see the product before purchasing.  I wouldn't have purchased this product.

Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!

There was no hole in the box it was shipped in, so it had to be done before they packaged it to ship out. See indention and hole in poster in photos.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Bracelet was very nice looking at first. The silver tarnished in a matter of days. Then the entire bracelet fell apart while I was sleeping. I contacted support and response was the 30 day return window had just passed. And  sometimes they fall apart while you sleep and to restring it myself because shipping is to expensive. Save your money and buy one that’s better made and better support.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was highly satisfied with with stone itself. The band thickness is okay but turned my finger colors within a couple days wear. I avoided washing hands and lotion while wearing. This was not great value product. I've bought cheaper rings that didn't turn.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Don’t buy this or you will be disappointed! Nothing but cardboard paper that needs double sided tape to put in wall. Not very happy with this
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I found the earrings very pretty online, but when the box arrived it was empty.  I received a refund from amazon, but what I really wanted was to have the earrings on time, they were for a birthday.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The measurements are wrong.. I got this shirt and it was way too big. Also, the shirt came with just the face the word vibe was not written underneath.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Love the concept, but the kitten photo looks like a thumbnail that someone blew up. It's pixelated and very fuzzy, made more obvious by the crisp lettering next to it.<br />Not worth hanging. I regret wasting the money.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Look anive
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These are too small for my ear. I think that it is not actually 8mm. The clasp is ridiculously hard to put on, and it took 3 people and an hour to get these on. Once on, they are too small and hug my ear tightly without moving. These are also extremely bendable. If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them. Also, the material made my ears react to them and I have never has this problem before
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The shirts were amazing! It looks just like the pucture. They were soft and run true to size. The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I wanted to love these and I REALLY tried to. They work really well until you need to wash them, then they are never the same and do not perform like they did before. :(
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name. I wish the engraving came in a different color or at least a little thicker. Did not meet my expectations like the photos

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Exactly as another reviewer said.  Looks like someone (anyone) just pulled a jpg and stretched it to print on card stock.<br /><br />This doesn't even count as a photo or a "print".<br /><br />You could do the same thing for less than $1 by sending a internet jpg to Walmart to print.  Wasteful and feels very dishonest.

The fonts are available online and it would have looked sharp properly printed.  The black and white would have looked great<br />Nope... this was the seller pulling a low quality image of the logo off the internet and printing it on a color copier.<br />The result... a slightly blurry image with grayish white fuzzy lettering on a washed out blackish background<br />buyer beware

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I received this necklace as a graduation gift from my best friend. Immediately I loved it! Its a super cute necklace and came packaged nicely. I have only wore my necklace for 3 days now, and the plating is flaking and peeling off. There is hardly any on the back and the sides, and its working towards the front. I am very disappointed that this has happened so soon after very minimal wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: When I purchased this item I thought I was buying pictures that I could hang on the wall but when I opened the package they were just prints so you have to read everything I suppose because it is very misleading and I also bought another set which is very misleading
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with. Please be careful and be aware of this when ordering your pendant.<br />I would order this again in a heartbeat if the cross coin was a bit larger and much heavier.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful nosering and reasonable shipping time. Two-star rating only because the stem of the nosering is way too short and doesn't poke all the way through the piercing. Sadly I'm unable to wear it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: My daughter order this sticker and was very disappointed (as was I) to the quality for the price. It's cute, but clearly a home craft on homeowner quality material.<br /><br />Really surprised to see this seller on Amazon and not a craft platform.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I'm a grandmother always trying to keep up with the times. I thought this dress was precious and it's not so much that everyone else didn't so much not like the dress itself and the cute ring of flowers (I bought it in white) BUT.....I BOUGHT THE YEAR "FIVE" and all I heard was how messed up the "F" looked and I had to agree with them!!!! It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!! I also wish that they would of offered an add-on sale of under dress shorts so I didn't spend so much time hunting down some.....right color, size, price, etc.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Sorely disappointed! This just a leather match case. Basically multiple layers of ground up leather base synthetics and glue. Ages much faster the real leather and breaks at bends very quickly. This would have been a nice little bag if the craftsman had chosen better materials. For this price I could have gotten two canvas bags that would last much longer.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Sloppily made. One of the shelves is split significantly causing it to be nearly impossible to place anything on that shelf cause its small as it is and not functional with the split shelf. Looks rustic and cute but doesn't serve a purpose.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This bracelet is NOT what the pic looks like. The pic must buy magnified 500 times! The "stones" look like they are made for a Baby bracelet!  I am very upset with this company and the way it was described  and pictured. Will never buy from there again!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This glorified sticker did not stick. Not only that, it's impossible to remove from the paper it comes packaged on. It's flimsy and a waste. It was a scam and this product is a scan run by a fake company. I should have bought from a reliable company. This is my opinion, make you're own choice.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not good quality
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These are slightly bigger than 11x14 and will not fit in a frame unless you cut them down. Can you cut a straight line? Me either. Disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not sticky enough so peels at various points (on the plus side, it's easy to remove). Didn't quite fit Quest so first had to be trimmed and it just doesn't lay right on non-flat headset surface. I'll probably put two small googly eyes on instead (each with a small enough surface area to be<br />on a more or less flat part of the device).
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Awful product. Tasted nothing like baja blast.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The print is cute. I ordered these for my identical twin boys that will be turning 2 soon. Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is absolutely NOT what is pictured.  What is pictured looks to be all metal with the shimmering disc in the middle, but it's not.  It's a metal pendant backing, but the rest is a sticker - the whole stargate and event horizon are a sticker.  If I could give 0 stars, I would.

Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste.

Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It arrived horribly bent. Even though the cost was so low, I assumed it would be more substantial than it was in terms of the paper and the the foil, but oh well. Not really worth the $10 for it to arrive like this.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Easy to put on and take off! Save tearing up your pant pockets and belts!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: BEWARE: this is NOT the correct nose piercing gauge. 24 gauge is way too thin; standard is 20 gauge. Thin jewelry, especially when curved, can cause the "cheese cutter" effect. I'll admit though, I LOVED the way it looked on my nose initially.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: This is absolutely not worth the money. It does not fit in a 9 x 11 frame because it cuts off the print also it is a piece of photo copy paper print it out I was very disappointed

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Glad I have different backs for earrings because these had no hole in one and the other was too small to get the earring through.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Brakes quickly
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheaply made. Cannot even read the engraving unless you hold it under a light. Definitely would not recommend this for a nice gift for someone as the quality is underwhelming.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have other line art that is awesome. This picture is NOT. It looks so amateurish like it was drawn with a thick magic marker. So I returned it and bought the "pinky swear" art piece from another source. So happy with the new one.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice, but for the price I would expect better quality not just a picture on photo paper

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I used this maybe 4 times, and it started fraying apart. This is cheaply made, not safe at all. The material is very flimsy and thin. I do not recommend this at all, it can definitely seriously injure someone if they don't check their tack every time they ride.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It is very cute, but it arrived broken.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This review is for the product not the seller.<br />The colors were not vibrant. A California poppy should be orange. I received brown colored poppies. The seller did refund my money.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth any price. Firstly, 21oz size is an outright lie. Without ice it holds under 12ozs. Handle is made of plastic and poorly attached. "Personalization" is a sticker that will quickly be destroyed by any moisture. Garbage.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Missing stone and I haven’t even worn it yet
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Love the look of this and while it does seem easy to install, it didn’t work out very well. The “L” didn’t stick down to the morrow well so when pulling up the backing it shifted. It now looks like a lower case “b”
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very uncomfortable very hard to keep in place, I would not recommend
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These address stickers were stuck to the backing to the point that they wouldn’t come loose and adhere to the metal mailbox. I ended up tearing them up trying to get them to work.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Did not work as promised. I have used on two sores with no effect. Waste of money for me
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not only is quality very poor but the plastic posts bend easily and are difficult to get into ear.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

So I was expecting a larger size purse than this.<br />Other than that it is a pretty purse.<br />Please adjust your description of this item!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a gorgeous shoe rack, but I am really disappointed that one of the pieces of wood arrived chipped/damaged (see pictures).

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Love the lightweight feeling. Good color and size. However the front fell off. I tried repairing them but I still managed to loose the wood bit and was left with just a post.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Although the packaging is cute, that was about all that I enjoy about these. The wood of the match is extremely dry and weak. EVERY match I use breaks.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: These were perfect and cute for about 4 hrs, until I decided to just change my shirt. Immediately got caught on the earring, ripped it out of my ear and bent the earring beyond the point of being able to bend it back into shape. Complete waste of money. If you so much as bend this somewhat the wrong way, you simply cannot get it back into a circle and it’s garbage. Shame.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This products red color was not received as advertised. Therefore making it useless for my purpose and unable to use.  The brim of the hat was distorted.  The box was small in comparison to hat size and arrived later than indicated.  For the poor quality of product the hat was over priced.  Sending back and would not order again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This necklace is beautiful and very dainty.  This is the 3rd one I've bought.  As careful as I've been with them, each chain has broken within weeks of purchasing them.  I kept seeing reviews recommending a stronger chain so I was hoping each time I bought another one that maybe they had used a stronger chain, but unfortunately, they have not.  As pretty as this is, I wouldn't recommend it.

Total waste of money.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I think it looks pretty cool but would look much better with a glass cylinder to house the light. Also, no hardware to hang is included and although the manufacturer seemed nice, was pretty unhelpful with recommendations. The wire and housing are IKEA.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I've always wanted a world map with pins. This one is beautiful, but there are some things I'd caution buyers about.  Some of the pieces are not very well made. For instance, once I'd put the pin in the UK piece, it broke :(  Next, it's not very easy to assemble, especially on the floor. And once you put it on the wall, forget about trying to get it off again to make any adjustments...the pieces will break if you try to remove them from the wall. Also, double check your flags....some flags were wrong on mine (such as Peru) and some flags were in the wrong place (for me, the Saudi Arabia flag was in the place of Russia's flag). Google ALL flags before pinning them on your wall if you aren't 100% confident that you know the country's flag. I won't be returning mine because, as I said, it's difficult to remove it from the wall and I paid a lot of money for it...easier to just leave it as it is at this point.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I waited 30 days of shipping to get these two toe rings. These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very pretty but didn't last. Normal wear, didn't catch on anything.  Just fell apart when my daughter picked up to put it on.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly. The seller insisted I bought the wrong case for my model phone... I did not. The case is not made properly. The only option I was given was to replace the case with the same case. No thanks.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Definitely not worth the money. Go get it at walmart for the same price but bigger
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Definitely not what I expected. Has absolutely no lather to it at all. Smell is good. Seems to be too oil based. Would not purchase again! I have started ordering a homemade whip from a local vendor, 14oz for $14. Also offer an assortment of different scents and goes a long way!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Necklace arrived made incorrectly. Will not order again.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I don't love these. They are very dainty, which I wanted, but because there is no real clasp to them and you just have to close the ends together they get stuck in my ear and it hurts. I'm constantly adjusting them to makw them look okay. They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes. I probably wouldn't buy these again. Very light weight and dainty but that was the only part I liked about them
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I love Columbia’s fragrances, however this one is less than desirable. I was expecting something similar to the scent of the Poly. This is not it.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: *UPDATE* After I gave this to my friend, she went two days and one of the horns fell off according to her. She wears pendants and such quite often so I don't think it was a matter of carelessness on her part. I haven't seen how broken the piece is but when it's a gift that breaks after just two days, it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift and I must say the customization in colors and design are great. I love the selection that's available and it really helps to make it a unique gift. At first I didn't know if it would be too big, since I've seen some 20 sided die that are huge, but it's a perfect size to display the dragon and die without being too heavy. Awesome work, you rolled a 20
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This ring looks & it is obviously been used fir many years , it is all oxidized& looks disgusting. It was sold as a New one.... You cannot even see the 925 marking at all . If you are selling your old rings you should say so!!!!

Deciding to go with a Sunflowers type theme in my bathroom which was the reasoning behind this purchase that failed me miserably.  I saw the pictures of the sunflowers and completely failed to read any other description about the pics..  O snap!! Amazon delivers it and I'm looking for a  very small box, at least,  and a box I did receive if it's the size of a FedEx overnight envelope!!! I opened it and the the 3 pictures were like the flimsy 8x10's that come in the 20 dollar elementary school portrait package from back in the Dinosaur era.  I giggled uncontrollably, for a few at my misfortune and politely sealed the envelope back up and placed in the spring cleaning in the summer box!!!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It is not as pictured. The headband I received says Happy Hanukkah all over it. Nowhere near as cute as the one pictured. Also, just FYI the under part of the headband is a weak thin strap. Actually looks more like a sleeping mask than a headband.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It’s not what I expected, it’s too small to give us a gift unless it’s for an infant. The quality is great but everything else is not worth the money and it’s ridiculously small to be considered a gift.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice but be aware that if you order from this company and you want to return something-its a 20% restocking fee and the customer pays for the return back. IMO not worth it. Product is just OK. Not really great.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Watch out, being deceived. They use a dark background on this picture so when you actually see them they are a very expensive clear beer glass.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: This product asked for 6 extra dollars to arrive a blue gift box, and instead it came in a trashy looking bland cardboard box. I have better and cuter gift boxes lying around my house I could've used, so that was a major let down.<br />And the chain came knotted and I couldn't unknot it! I tried gifting this to my mother but even she couldn't get it loose.<br />Also some of the engraved letters have a bit of a smudge.<br />Please, please, please save your money and look elsewhere.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I'm giving this product two stars because in theory it was a great idea. However the reality of it is there's more bulk that's easier to catch on objects and the tape gets sweaty which is detrimental to keeping the omnipod on.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: No way is this worth almost $20. The tune is off, the quality is.. junk-ey. It has to be hand cranked continuously to keep playing (CAN NOT BE WOUND). I honestly wish I would have just bought the brown one for 1/2 the price
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The pendant is very nicely engraved and my boyfriend loves it however the chain broke in 2 places already and it has only been 10 days since he started wearing it. For the price of this product I expected a lot better quality and am very disappointed. I will be keeping keeping the pendant but will be replacing the chain for a better quality one.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The glass is quality made glass, but it is difficult to read the saying when glass is not full. But we are unable to read it when glass is full.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: product is to small no like picture
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is the most irritating purchase I think I’ve made, the pieces have no structure to them they’re super fragile, the finished image above is nowhere near what you are purchasing (seller needs to remove that image), half the prints don’t line up with the small rod assembly holes, they’re no instructions whatsoever, and you have to provide your own assembly rods, the butt stock is literally 2 different sizes, this seller needs to seriously address the quality of their products and redesign most of them, this isn’t the only item I’ve been severely disappointed with from them, you’re much better off going to an Etsy shop and spending a bit more money, it will be a much better investment.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: To small
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters "machine engraved". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was super excited to get a custom shirt.  Super soft!  But didn’t even get through one day of wearing and the material started to peel/fray.  The letters look great.  But I feel maybe I should just frame it and make it a decoration near my workout area instead.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very small, and cheap plastic for the price. I didnt see any pictures that represented the correct type of plastic because even hard plastic is better than this gummy thing. Not worth more than like $6 at the most...
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was denied a return on this bracelet. Reason given…”Resized or altered jewelry cannot be returned.” I assume the symbol I selected to be embossed on underside of bracelet is considered an alteration. However, you have to choose a symbol or word to have embossed before you can place the order. Do not order if you think there is any reason you may want to return it!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with "Our Anniversary"  [our names] and  [date]  with  "25 years  and Counting".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  "Magnetic" pages is just a new name for old school "press & stick" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.

I don’t know it’s just ok. It’s for a guest half bath for laugh value so I’m keeping it but I won’t order more prints from here.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I will say it is a cute idea, but the wood they used was horrible, it was all burnt color and not very attractive, I had to paint it before I use it just to make it more attractive. not what I thought, it could have been painted before it was shipped.  even white would have been fine, but not bare wood.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture says it all. There was no place for me to give them directions that I did not want their tool icons or images on my sign. So I took a chance thinking that somebody would have the forethought not to put the tools on a no diving sign. I would return the damn thing but I needed it for insurance purposes. Somebody needs to pull their head out of their bottom and think about their customers needs! Who in the hell would want wrenches and screwdrivers on a simple sign that says no diving shallow.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: If you are bigger than a size 2 you wont be able to wear these fanny packs around your waist like they're intended for. Horrible product. Wouldnt recommend these to anyone. And not to mention the seller, CampusConnection is giving me a hard time when trying to request a refund. Horrible customer service on their end
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Thought it was bigger and better quality but its just a print on parchment paper basically
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not satisfied at all.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I received one bar of soap when the picture depicted 3. It should have been clearer if there is only one bar for the price point. The soap itself looked strange. I've bought handmade soap before and I guess I was expecting something similar. I sent it back because I wouldn't pay $6 for one bar of soap (especially when I was expecting 3).
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Love the print, had to have it. Wish I saved my cash. The t-shirt itself is super thin and shrunk alot. I wouldn't even care if it was a 10 dollar fair t-shirt, but at 27 bucks I expect a little bit more.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This item is literally a cheap plain face plate with decorative tape on it. I’m so annoyed. Natural oils on fingers or hands that turn off and on the light will eventually cause this is discolor and fade. Complete let down
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Looks great at first...took less than a week for charms to tarnish.  Waste of money. Loved it at first just needs to be better quality.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: These earrings didn't seem worth the price. They were very thin, the hammering detail was not very pronounced, the reverse side was just shiny, no hammering detail at all. I'm sending them back.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Please know that this is not a three dimensional manatee. The back of it is pen/hollow.  It doesn’t look realistic if you’re a manatee lover like me. Disappointed:(<br /><br />Update on 2/21/23:  The crystal came off now :(
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Terrible! The Recall Newsom sticker is literally TAPED on to a magnet. Magnet is not strong due to tape. Save your money and make your own. You can literally buy magnets that you don't have to apply tape too. There are magnets that allow for items to stick to them without tape. I'm highly disappointed in this.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I should have read the comments, this thing doesn't quite look like the picture and is way too chunky to wear. The gems are on long metal posts that stick way out. I got this to match a rose gold necklace I purchased at the same time, but its too chunky and fake looking to wear.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The bag itself seems of decent quality, but the buckles and zippers are tarnished so bad that they look like they have been stored under water.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This product is NOT worth what I paid for it.  DO NOT purchase a name board from this company.  The board that the letters fit in is VERY thin and will break VERY easily it's so thin.  The message that I paid extra for on the back of the board is also VERY poor quality.  Some of the letters are very visible and will fade.  I would not have chosen ANY STARS, but I had to choose at least one.  VERY DISSATISFIED!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered 2 of these to decorate a cup for my mother and myself. I followed the directions to the letter, but part of the decal would stick and the other would try to pull off.

This pin chipped within a week of having it. I filled the chip in with red sharpie and it seemed to look somewhat ok, but then it complexity broke off the actual pin and was lost. I wanted to love this and support the artist, but it was so disappointing right from the get go. I wouldn’t even bother purchasing

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Like tons of others who did not read the product details carefully enough, I expected this to be metal.  It is printed on photograph paper.  Now I have to frame it.  The thing that bothers me the most about it is that I have doubts that the actual artist was involved in this transaction.  For all I know I just overpaid an art thief.  What a racket!  The octopus model probably wasn’t paid either.  At least it is a wonderful image.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These were the most uncomfortable earrings I have ever bought. Within minutes of putting them on my ears started to itch! They turned red and started flaking the next day. One clasp came undone and I lost it and eventually found it. Don’t buy if you’re allergic to fake jewelry or have sensitive ears.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I loved the size of the disk and length of the chain, but very disappointed that the rings holding the disks on have already tarnished after a few short wears. Allergic to silver and can only wear when gold plating is true.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Ring fits perfect. You can’t read the name on it tho, so I find that pretty disappointing. I have to feel the ring to know the name is still there. Great delivery time. Just kind of defeats the purpose when I can’t see the name.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Had an obvious machine-made scratch on the face.  Very amusing (and accurate) sentiment - and appropriate - and  having smiled and appreciated the sentiment initially -  my wife decided (at 45) that she is now a prude so stated it was "rude, vulgar and nasty" therefore,  discarded it! ^^
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These earrings were so pretty online and when I received them they were sooo small that you couldn't really see the stones and are hard to put on because they are so tiny. These earrings would be fine for a small child but not for an adult.  Very disapointed.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Smelled great in the package and came with a few simple wax melts.<br />Does not last long once it is melting and cant really smell it unless you are on top of it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth the money. I can’t smell a thing. I even tried the free samples they sent. The only reason I purchased this is because it’s the only one made in the US. But steamers from other companies are a lot more powerful with nice aroma.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Received the completely wrong item, not even close.

I came across this one and chose to go with this option as it was a great price and had great reviews. My son was only able to wear it for about a week as it turned silver/blackish. When I first opened it I loved it ,but it truly is poor quality and would not recommend it all as it is a waste of money and lasts so little.

I thought this dress was precious and it's not so much that everyone else didn't so much not like the dress itself and the cute ring of flowers (I bought it in white) BUT.....I BOUGHT THE YEAR "FIVE" and all I heard was how messed up the "F" looked and I had to agree with them!!!! It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!! I also wish that they would of offered an add-on sale of under dress shorts so I didn't spend so much time hunting down some.....right color, size, price, etc.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: First one the metal loop that the lace goes through was crooked and it would hang at an angle. Looked odd. Tried to bend it back and it snapped like cheap plastic. Sent it back and got another one. Straight this time but the metal loop was slightly off center. Looked much better hanging though so I was happy with it until the screw that goes into the pendant just came out on its own. Probably could fix it with super glue but at this point I don't even care. Save your money and buy from a different manufacturer.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I was excited to receive these bath bombs only to be very disappointed. You don't have an option to pick your scents. So, you have to trust what you receive will be nice. I purchased one box for myself and one as a gift. Out of 12 total bath bombs approximately 5 smell acceptable. I recommend the vendor allow the purchaser to choose scents. This will allow the vendor to track what is working/popular and what should be ccx eliminated from the product line. I did appreciate the fact each bath bomb is individually sealed. Nice touch.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Was so excited to finally go from a stud to a hoop. I ordered a size too small the first time, so I ordered a bigger size and it fit perfectly! I noticed right away it was kind of uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to it being something new and irritation from changing to a hoop. Well 9 hours later my nose is forming a bump where the hole is and it's even more irritating, itching and starting to get uncomfortable. I sadly have to take it out before it gets too bad! I guess it will be a stud for now. I never had an issue with nose bones, which is what i like to use. This is the first time I had an issue with jewelry. Just something to think about if you're on the fence about ordering one of these.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It.  W as.  Ok.  Not.  Ashapply.  When.  It.  Came
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I just loved this cover...but it allowed my screen protector to crack twice.  First time I thought it must've been due to a drop, but didn't recall it ever dropping.  I got a warranty replacement for my screen protector and the very next day I heard it crack!  All I did is put my phone down face down. The bumpers on the side didn't protect it at all as the edges of the protector was scratched up as well. I don't dare have a phone without a screen protector so this beautiful case just doesn't work for me...but I sure wish it did. Because I already got a warranty replacement for the first one, I have to pay bucks to pay for another protector...and a new case. I understand I won't get a full refund because it's been used some, so I'm doubly screwed.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: UPDATE: Unfortunately, the bracelet broke over the weekend of 02/24/2023 the rattail cording snapped, and my teen lost 5 of the 6 beads that were released when the bracelet broke. Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: My bracelet is mostly black with a few beads showing a bit of blue. Not the more grey/blue shown in the picture. I gave it two stars because the quality is good and fits great. I just wasn't looking for another black bracelet.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I expected weight to the pendant and it was a brown string with a plastic pendant!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It's nicely sewn but... I certainly expect more for the money. It's the old time style where holder is split" in middle. There's still enough opening to get debris inside holder and onto tissue. Flimsy cotton. *Cute* kitties though.<br />On photo it looked like holder had a flap and I'd have to open to pull tissue out. Not as convenient as this style but better. I can see this getting lots of lint, dust or whatever into and on holder/tissue; plus I'd be washing it a lot. Not worth it.

You would have to cut and align them to make a proper picture. It came in 4 different sheet cuts, and after that I had to cut into multiple places to align all the flowers. I tried reaching out to seller but no response.<br />I spent $400 to cover one small wall, and I was expecting a quality wallpaper. I had it professionally installed but still didn’t work out for me.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Most uncomfortable noise ring I've ever worn in my life. Says it is Sterling silver, maybe plated, but is definitely nickel or some other cheap metal. It tarnished and caused severe irritation to my piercing (redness, tenderness, and swelling) and NO my piercing is not new, it was done over a decade ago. For around the same price, sometimes less, you can get a 4pk of nose rings from Ruffian that are WAY BETTER, in my opinion, they've never caused me any issues and I've used them for almost 3 years now. It makes me genuinely sad, this was so cute and I had such high hopes. Don't get me wrong, IT IS SUPER CUTE, I was in love with it when I first put it in, but after barely a day my nose was soooo sore and when I took out the nose ring to look at my piercing the ring was black, washed my piercing immediately and put in a hoop from my Ruffian pack and was fine in a couple days, haven't had a problem since.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I wish I had known before purchasing that this was going to be sheer/see through. Tried wearing a tank top under it, a white bra, everything and it just didn't look like. Even with pasties on, those show through.<br /><br />I wanted to support small business and they left a cute note with the shirt but I was still highly disappointed. Just be aware that its completly sheer and see through before purchasing.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I didn’t realize how tiny this would be. The picture makes it look so big, and honestly it was the size of my finger nail. And the embossed leave with your initial is so faint it is sort of pointless. I also don’t believe it is genuine turquoise, which is the stone I ordered. It sounds like plastic resin when you tap on it. I also spent more money upgrading to the sterling silver chain, and sterling silver always has to be indicated with the 925 label. The chain doesn’t look like sterling silver at all. I pretty much feel like I got ripped off. I ended up going to a different store and buying a legitimate turquoise necklace.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived in a thin shipping cardboardish shipping envelope stuffed in a plastic shipping bag. Results, photo with several creases and bends in it. To think it took more than a week to rcv a damaged poorly printed, photo. Id been far better off printing this out from my home printer working from a screenshot of the product. Couldn't be more disappointed in the overall quality and lack of care that was took when packaging for shipment. Had this been put inside a cardboard box with bubble wrap and the box arrived beat up and damaged, I would understand that it was likely the shipping company that done this, however this was clearly a lack of care by the seller because of the manner in which it left their possession in the first place. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!

Then.... six more weeks passed and the same thing happened! It is hanging in my office and receives no direct sunlight. I’m highly disappointed.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered this as a gift for my 6ft 1” son. There’s no way it could be taken off over his head without disconnecting it. It would also sit really high up under his chin, it’s very very short. It might be better with foil if the foil doesn’t come off. He opened it at Christmas and looked it over, never even realizing it was monogrammed at all. I had to tell him was and that it was monogrammed so he could look closer. He’s young and has good eyesight and still couldn’t see it in a normally lit room. If you hold it up to the light at an angle you can make it out but I was super disappointed. It was not the custom cool little accessory I hoped for. I should have inspected it before I stuck it in the bag with his other stuff. He was so impressed that I found it still here at clean up time the next day sitting on end table. The strap I got really doesn’t fit the scale of the item pictured.<br />So in summary, the monogram is too shallow to be seen , strap too rough cut and short to make this the nice strap you will be expecting. If you buy this you might feel embarrassed like I was.

Company refuses refunds or exchanges on custom orders... SO BUYER BEWARE!!!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Unfortunately the key is totally inaccurate.<br />Misidentified fish.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This product fell off the wall, it does not stick. I was not issued a refund as requested
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture is deceiving it it much smaller than shown very disappointing.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These earrings appeared to be cowhide. They are plastic with a photo of plastic cowhide & blue cross. They are blurry at that. I could return them but had to pay shipping to do so.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Love these earrings. I have never had a pair with a rubber backing before and it’s great!<br />Updated: backing has separated from the stone. Only got to wear them a few times before they broke. Bummer because they are SO cute!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The Stitching on the mask is loose and not well done. other than that the fabric is nice. I would expect a handmade mask at this price point to have better stitching
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This product was extremely miniscule although the photo shows detail in the design, the actual earring was extremely tiny and very thin. Child sized at best.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this as a GIFT! How embarrassing! It FELL APART just after it was taken out of the box. It was monogrammed front, GLUED to a CHEAP ID reel.<br />Money should be returned!!
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Loved the rings initially. I tried the blue one  on and then went to switch it out for the other  one. It broke down the middle. Disappointed because the rings are beautiful and light weight, but the quality is poor.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Buyer beware: Sadly, this ring is nothing I’d hoped nor that the seller described —and— the seller was no help.  Smaller than standard sizing and the stone was acrylic/glass but NOT quartz.  A pretty disappointing consumer experience on Amazon.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Broke within the first few hours of wearing them.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not what I expected. When you say plated, you get the impression that it will be on some sort of metal. Ex, brass, nickel, copper... but this is thin plastic. Feels like it will break easily. For the price, I think it's a rip off. You can find something like this at a flea market for about $5 - $10 bucks

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not even map ,bad quality picture of another bad picture of a map. Garbage
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Wanted to like this, but didn't care for the cheap black thread the masks were hung on. Not the black/ white rope thats in the pic. Also the masks were a little washed out.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Wasn't the way I ordered. I requested rose gold and got hot pink color.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These stickers are so cute! However, they don't stick very well. I used them to make potion bottles as Halloween decorations and they don't stick well at all on plastic.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: pretty & sparkly but not high quality. Feels cheap & not particularly comfortable. Would be good for children or as a costume jewelry piece,
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: waste of money - time piece did not work - useless

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I was not happy with product. Not quality paper for the price. Asked to return and your as refuse.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Should be $5. Feels cheap.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It took a long time to get these.. I got them 2 weeks after Christmas. The packaging was very nice. Displayed the product well. Unfortunately, the product itself wasn't very good. I placed it in the shower, out of the way of direct shower spray. It did dissolve slowly, but the smell was not very strong. I was very disappointed. I wanted and waited for these, definitely NOT worth it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Lost its color within 2 months. Won't buy again.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cute but slip out of ear wash too easily. Disappointed  by this fact.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The product is thin, and frail. It didn’t come with a hook or a ribbon to hang it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Had to take it out after the first day because my entire side of my face was so sore from the metal this was made of out. I’m assuming there is nickel in this silver. Super sad because it looked adorable on
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Man I should’ve read the reviews...  bracelet was way too small.  Fit my wife, but for a man’s wrist it doesn’t work at all.  Left a blue pattern and cut off the circulation.  This is also advertised as 10mm beads.  Instead these are 7mm.  Cheap cheap cheap.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very small cheeply made not worth the money
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Baby size waste of money
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very disappointed, there was no scent!  Requested a refund and it was given without question.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: For the price the stone was sort of ugly and small. The setting is great but compared to the other necklaces I’ve bought from this vender, I was disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Took way too long to receive. Not a good quality
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The idea of this is cute but the page from the dictionary does not go with the image, I got the letter T so it has several definitions for Taint and Take. I intended to give this as a gift but will probably end up throwing this away. It was delivered in great condition but sad to say I'm disappointed with the page it was printed on.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Nothing like the picture<br />Made so cheap I couldn't believe
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too big and goofy looking
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap material (plastic and aluminum). The lamp at the top of the post is not worth the extra money, it is small and the light is a tiny white light. While it is attractive from afar, certainly not worth the price. Seller forgot to include the lamp hook. Not customer friendly or solution oriented.  Would never recommend to my neighbors.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Nothing about this item is real but the cardboard box, I would doubt the chain is even plated silver, let alone actual silver. The "pearl" isn't even good costume jewelry, and the paint was flaking off when it arrived. They could have used a shell pearl instead of cultured and fooled most people... but nope wanted to cut all costs and used plastic beads. Ridiculous. I can't stand deceptive sellers, stay away!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Happy with the ring itself. Upset I received a clear stone instead of the blue I ordered. Will be returning the ring and trying again.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very tiny trinkets. It was cheaply made.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Print on photo paper good quality, but it is an 8x10 not 11x14 as described.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The idea is unique, and I was excited to personalize and order the larger sized canvas for my son and daughter-in-law's Christmas gift.  When it arrived, it was very disappointing.  The item was expensive but looked cheap.  Even the personalization did not stand out.  Such a shame!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Cut outs were flimsy and not as described.  I requested return and they wanted me to pay shipping.  They didn’t give me time to respond and closed the return ticked in under 24 hours when it should have been 30 days.  Poor business BEWSRE!!!!!
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I absolutely love the look of these earrings, but the quality is really lacking, especially for the price! They are unique, as I'm always looking for pieces that are different than you normally see, but they feel very flimsy and I don't know how long they will hold up.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The size as depicted in the ad is not what I received. Mine is small. I don’t even want it now.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: No smell
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so disappointed! The stone in the ring I received was less than half the size of what is pictured that you are ordering. The stone was much smaller than I expected!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Wish It clasp differently
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is probably my own fault for not understanding this is basically a photo. It looked like a beautiful wood piece in the picture posted here.  That is not what it is. The description says it doesnt come with a frame, "but why would it need one?" Or, that was my thought when I bought it. So yes, I was surprised and disappointed that I payed over $13... for a photo.  We will try to make it work for what we planned but it likely was just $13 I wasted.  I am not returning it, as there was nothing wrong with it.  It just was not what I expected, I purchase.  Seeing as there has not been a review yet,  I felt buyers may want to know what they are getting.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Much too small!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Once these were washed my twins couldn’t wear them. Way too short and wide, and I didn’t even dry them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Got this and another Corgi print for my daughter for Christmas. While I thought they were cute they were not her taste. You can’t even mail them back on your own and they are charging $3.99 EACH to return them!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: You get what you pay for. The other reviews are so positive I was excited to buy this for my wife for Valentine’s Day. When I got it I had to scratch the “engraving” because it appeared more like a sticker than an engraving. The chain is not the best quality, but like I said, for a low price the custom option is great and delivery is quick.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The earrings are beautiful, but I cannot wear them as the gauge is soo thick on the post that it won’t fit in my ears. Very disappointing.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is just flat pictures.. not canvas pictures.. had I read the description maybe i would have known but i was shocked when the package arrived. I purchased frames from the dollar store so i made it work.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: poor image quality. After looking over the images, I reloaded Minnie is very inked over with spillage from other images as well as Tinkerbell. Size small shirt has ink outside the black Mickey ears background<br /><br />Tip. Measure your favorite t shirt that fits the way you want you shirt to fit then compare those measurements to the sellers size chart to get the most accurate measurements expectations. I did this with all four of our shirts and although it took a min, I’m glad I did so I knew what to expect. Also, size up for that oversize look or if in doubt!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this for a young man, who liked its looks. He wore it to his Youth Group and the bracelet broke. It was less than 24 hours of wear.  So disappointing!  The beads scattered all over, making it impossible to return. He is sad, and I feel totally scammed. Any jewelry should last longer than that! Don't buy!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The price is not bad
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very cool bracelet. But I broke in less than a week.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Broke in the first week of wearing.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It was too hard to figure out how to get it on.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Absolutely disappointed. Already returning after having just got it, from the description pictures you'd think it would be of really nice quality. But when it arrived I realized they charged me a ridiculous price for something that is of 50¢ machine quality.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: amazon refunded me for this. low-res image. pixelated and awful looking. why do people sell garbage like this?
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The design is darling except for one critical thing. It doesn't mention anywhere that you have to scratch off the silver sticker to read the message.<br />So if you aren't present when the person opens it to explain what to do- they would have no clue there is something written underneath the silver "planet." It just looks like part of the design. You could write instructions on the back of the card, but who wants to do that if you are sending out a large amount. And you can't write on the front because its dark in color.<br />They need to add a simple "scratch here" or something to the silver sticker or the back of the card- otherwise they are pretty much useless. Disappointing.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This necklace was ordered for me as a gift. This necklace seems well made, but it is not plated well. Within an hour of wearing it turned my whole chest black. I have written to them twice now and they refuse to respond. Not worth the effort.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: They are really big and they look cheap
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This ring was so small I could not even see the floral details and it wasn't dimensional like you see in the photo.  It would be good for a little girl's first ring but not an adult.  I returned it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: First off, I love how the lettering looks, and was very excited to put it in my little girls loft. The wall I tried to put this on is only a little bit textured and the name didn’t even try to stick! I was so disappointed. I followed the directions, waited, and nothing! It just sucks that I’m out the money now and all I have is a tail. There should be something somewhere saying only buy this if you plan to put the name on a completely flat and smooth surface.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The color is not very bold.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This case does not hold the 2 fluid ounce paint bottles as advertised and I have several different brands. It did not work for any of them. It was also very difficult to put together and you need super glue. Definitely overpriced for what it is.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Hi, I recently bought 3 sterling silver bracelets from you in July 2022. All 3 identical, 1 for myself and the other two for friends. This for me, just graduating college was a lot to spend. I was so excited when I received them. They were beautiful. But,  as I’ve worn mine daily since 7/29/22, the metal around the gems is red. Your website claimed the item to be sterling silver (925). I’m so disappointed and embarrassed since I gave the other two as gifts and they are in the same shape as mine. What a shamble. Annoyed and embarrassed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This did not work.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This item was not as big as it appeared and the material is awful! The design is nice but don’t wash it w other items bc it runs.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: First the delivery took much longer than expected. It came in a week late, which was frustrating because I went with them because of the estimated delivery dates. Also you should not try to repostion the decals once you put it on the cup, mine came apart and the letter broke. Other than those two things, the decals looked great, loved the lettering and the colors!
