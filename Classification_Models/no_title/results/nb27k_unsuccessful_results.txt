True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered a size large in women’s for my daughter who likes things oversize. The shirt is tiny. Unfortunately they do not offer returns or exchanges so I’m stuck with a shirt that would probably fit a five-year-old. I do not recommend buying from the shop, especially due to their return policy.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I followed all the instructions for putting this up. I was super excited to put this up in my toddlers room. When it was time to peel the rest of the paper off (the sticker had been up on the wall), it peeled all the letters off with it. I tried several different ways and it ended up ripping the lettering. Had to throw it in the trash.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: One of the white stone was missing when I received the ring. Poorly made. Seller never contacted. Won't suggest this product.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not genuine sterling silver or hypoallergenic.  The earrings are very flexible like plastic and irritate my earlobes.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip. Never got a chance to actually wear them but hoping to replace the post with a plastic rod, if I can find the right size.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...?? I'm disappointed in the price for the quality that was received, as I do not believe it is real silver .....

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This product is literally garbage.  It looks like someone scoured old construction sites until they found a piece of water warped plywood that they could use to make this sign.  It's less than 1/4 inch thick, has no attachments for hanging it, but it wont hang anyway because it's so warped.  Waste of money.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It was 4 times bigger than the product specifications said. I was told it would be 8.5x11 and it came 18x24. I ordered a frame for it and now I can't use it because the frame is too small.

During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.

I have been using a different brand of natural deodorant for 3 years, and felt that it was time to change things up, but this deodorant is not the solution for me. I like the essential oil scent, but it’s not enough to mask the stink.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to love this, so dainty & easy to shape but I cannot wear it a day without it irritating my nose.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice necklace but the thingy that I suspect adjusts the the length on your neck won’t move. The chain is too delicate to force it.  If I can’t figure it out soon, I’m returning this necklace.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Should have included paints.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For the price I paid I was expecting a Sterling silver chain. Was not very disappointing. Giftable but who wants a necklace that is going to change color because it’s fake silver. Not me. Pretty but upgrade to Sterling and I’m sure you’ll have a much greater turn around. Aloha!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so disappointed when I received these ear rings that I bought for my daughter for Christmas.  They are so over priced and look so cheap like they came from a dollar store.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Both frames were loosely put together.  One side on both frames were not flush put together.  There was a visible gap in the wood.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: So yes, they are cheap in price but you get what you juyst for.

However, they are both gone now too.<br /><br />Very cute charms but all three are lost now.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Was unable to see an example for the letter I wanted, which was an O, it was pretty hard to tell what it really was.  The swirl at the beginning of the O conflicted with the O itself.  The person I gave it to really had a hard time figuring out what was the top, bottom or sides.<br />.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another. It was very uneven. I was looking for navy blue and light blue which was shown in the picture and it came out as dark blue and purple which made it look a little girly for a boy’s room. The product was expensive plus shipping was not just worth my money.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The name plate area was much smaller than the original photo displayed.  I couldn't even easily read the name without a magnifying glass.<br />This is a result of not being able to actually see the product before purchasing.  I wouldn't have purchased this product.

And like me, you will realize this thing is basically a few simple cuts of plywood that have been stained and assembled using the cheapest legs you can purchase from your local hardware store.  Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It came damaged. Not exactly as pictured either. Which wasn’t a huge issue. But it being damaged is not acceptable. There was no hole in the box it was shipped in, so it had to be done before they packaged it to ship out. See indention and hole in poster in photos. You can see my poster is slightly different as well. (Has square outlines around dogs; again that particular thing was not a big to me, but just so others know).

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I had to return it.  It's great quality, however the picket is too small for the u.s dollar unless it's folded in half.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Poster itself is nice, glossy and rich colors.  They didn’t ship it in a tube though and instead used a small, long box, which did not hold its shape and resulted in the poster that had been rolled up inside to have creases throughout.  Very disappointed in what otherwise was a great product to have been ruined because the seller failed to properly package it.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was highly satisfied with with stone itself. The band thickness is okay but turned my finger colors within a couple days wear. I avoided washing hands and lotion while wearing. This was not great value product. I've bought cheaper rings that didn't turn.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I found the earrings very pretty online, but when the box arrived it was empty.  I received a refund from amazon, but what I really wanted was to have the earrings on time, they were for a birthday.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These are too small for my ear. I think that it is not actually 8mm. The clasp is ridiculously hard to put on, and it took 3 people and an hour to get these on. Once on, they are too small and hug my ear tightly without moving. These are also extremely bendable. If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them. Also, the material made my ears react to them and I have never has this problem before
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The shirts were amazing! It looks just like the pucture. They were soft and run true to size. The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: First of all, this came all the way from Turkey. The detail given to packaging and shipping, I would give 10 stars if I could.<br />The reason for 4 stars:  the knob to hold and pull the plate Feom needed to be a little bigger for gripping. I have used these in the past, but this one is more difficult to maneuver, especially hot.  It is also isnt glazed as others, so this one will retain flavors when cleaned.<br />The design otherwise is very pretty.<br />Update:  after cooking with them, we discovered that it ruined the taste of the food.  I think the solution is they need to glazed.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!!

I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one.

So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: BEWARE: this is NOT the correct nose piercing gauge. 24 gauge is way too thin; standard is 20 gauge. Thin jewelry, especially when curved, can cause the "cheese cutter" effect. I'll admit though, I LOVED the way it looked on my nose initially.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This was fine for a party decoration, even though it was printed slightly crooked. Absolutely not gift worthy. I ordered it as a gift; would not recommend for that purpose. Couldn’t return so I had to throw it away.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Thought it would be printed on sturdier cardboard or something other then flimsy paper for the price. Ended up returning wasn't worth pay for a frame, although the picture itself is really pretty on computer.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Glad I have different backs for earrings because these had no hole in one and the other was too small to get the earring through.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheaply made. Cannot even read the engraving unless you hold it under a light. Definitely would not recommend this for a nice gift for someone as the quality is underwhelming.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These will only show up on dark-skinned people. They are very pale and don't show up on light-skinned people. Also they can't get wet and are very cheap and lightweight plastic.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth any price. Firstly, 21oz size is an outright lie. Without ice it holds under 12ozs. Handle is made of plastic and poorly attached. "Personalization" is a sticker that will quickly be destroyed by any moisture. Garbage.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Love the look of this and while it does seem easy to install, it didn’t work out very well. The “L” didn’t stick down to the morrow well so when pulling up the backing it shifted. It now looks like a lower case “b”
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very uncomfortable very hard to keep in place, I would not recommend
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: These address stickers were stuck to the backing to the point that they wouldn’t come loose and adhere to the metal mailbox.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Are you kidding me???????????!!!!!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This products red color was not received as advertised. Therefore making it useless for my purpose and unable to use.  The brim of the hat was distorted.

As pretty as this is, I wouldn't recommend it.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Looking at my purchases you will note a number of Otter gifts for my wife. I bought this several months ago but wasn't open until her birthday May 8th. Looking at the sculptor the manufacture has the otter on its back on a pointed rock. If, that's not ridiculous enough the otter is on a pin about an eighth of an inch above the rock. Total waste of money.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I think it looks pretty cool but would look much better with a glass cylinder to house the light. Also, no hardware to hang is included and although the manufacturer seemed nice, was pretty unhelpful with recommendations. The wire and housing are IKEA. I had to figure out and purchase bracket to hang myself with the help of two electricians.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered 2, one for me and one for my best friend. They just came and I put mine on, but the chain is SO much more shorter than the one pictured on the woman.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I've always wanted a world map with pins. This one is beautiful, but there are some things I'd caution buyers about.  Some of the pieces are not very well made. For instance, once I'd put the pin in the UK piece, it broke :(  Next, it's not very easy to assemble, especially on the floor. And once you put it on the wall, forget about trying to get it off again to make any adjustments...the pieces will break if you try to remove them from the wall. Also, double check your flags....some flags were wrong on mine (such as Peru) and some flags were in the wrong place (for me, the Saudi Arabia flag was in the place of Russia's flag). Google ALL flags before pinning them on your wall if you aren't 100% confident that you know the country's flag. I won't be returning mine because, as I said, it's difficult to remove it from the wall and I paid a lot of money for it...easier to just leave it as it is at this point.

Not bad, if that makes sense, but definitely like dirt. I waited an hour or so to see if the scent would change, like some wrote. It didn't change, it just faded.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I waited 30 days of shipping to get these two toe rings. These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This was very underwhelming. I was planning on buying a ton of these and am very glad I didn't. My fiancee`s last name was left off even though I requested it. Where some of the words are wood burned in they are not clear and difficult to read and the magnent on the back looks like it was just thrown on there (not in a good place to keep this on my fridge). This falls off of my fridge daily and i am very glad I did not buy these for my guests. Shipping also took over a month.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This sweatshirt is absolute garbage. It is thin, poor quality and the graphic on the sweatshirt was crooked and bled onto other parts of the sweatshirt as if it was folded up before it was dry..And on top of that the return policy is such a hassle I am just going to keep it anyway. Also.. if you DO decide To deal with returning it they charge a 20% fee.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful toy but the balls on the rope didn't seem particularly secure to me. The rope part just looked glued in. It's possible it would have been fine but it seemed like it could be a choking hazard especially since this is designed for very young babies.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Definitely not what I expected. Has absolutely no lather to it at all. Smell is good. Seems to be too oil based. Would not purchase again!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Very pretty but the backings that came with the earrings didn’t fit. One of them fell out of my ear during the day never to be seen again. Also when tou put them on notice that they can’t go in the same direction unless you put them in only one ear.

Cheap craft glitter was used too and the image clearly shows flakes of some sort. Honestly just a disappointment.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Necklace arrived made incorrectly. Will not order again.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Extremely overpriced for the size. I gave it 2 stars simply because it is cute and Mickey Mouse. Otherwise, I would have given it a 1. The greenery is plastic, not realistic looking at all. There were hot glue strands all over the ears that I had to remove. It claims to be 10”, but from the top of the ear to the bottom of the wreath, it is 7”. From ear to ear across, it is only 9”. I feel like I was completely ripped off.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I don't love these. They are very dainty, which I wanted, but because there is no real clasp to them and you just have to close the ends together they get stuck in my ear and it hurts. I'm constantly adjusting them to makw them look okay. They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes. I probably wouldn't buy these again. Very light weight and dainty but that was the only part I liked about them

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: *UPDATE* After I gave this to my friend, she went two days and one of the horns fell off according to her. She wears pendants and such quite often so I don't think it was a matter of carelessness on her part. I haven't seen how broken the piece is but when it's a gift that breaks after just two days, it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift and I must say the customization in colors and design are great. I love the selection that's available and it really helps to make it a unique gift. At first I didn't know if it would be too big, since I've seen some 20 sided die that are huge, but it's a perfect size to display the dragon and die without being too heavy. Awesome work, you rolled a 20

Amazon delivers it and I'm looking for a  very small box, at least,  and a box I did receive if it's the size of a FedEx overnight envelope!!! I opened it and the the 3 pictures were like the flimsy 8x10's that come in the 20 dollar elementary school portrait package from back in the Dinosaur era.  I giggled uncontrollably, for a few at my misfortune and politely sealed the envelope back up and placed in the spring cleaning in the summer box!!!

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I'm giving this product two stars because in theory it was a great idea. However the reality of it is there's more bulk that's easier to catch on objects and the tape gets sweaty which is detrimental to keeping the omnipod on.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: No way is this worth almost $20. The tune is off, the quality is.. junk-ey. It has to be hand cranked continuously to keep playing (CAN NOT BE WOUND). I honestly wish I would have just bought the brown one for 1/2 the price

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this for my bedroom but could not smell it. I moved it to my guest bathroom. A 6 x 6 bathroom…. You still cant smell it! Way too expensive to not work. I can’t return it because I threw out the top and the box! Don’t buy it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love it it looks great. I get tons of compliments. However I hav only had it a month and it is tarnishing. The underside of it looks terrible. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is the most irritating purchase I think I’ve made, the pieces have no structure to them they’re super fragile, the finished image above is nowhere near what you are purchasing (seller needs to remove that image), half the prints don’t line up with the small rod assembly holes, they’re no instructions whatsoever, and you have to provide your own assembly rods, the butt stock is literally 2 different sizes, this seller needs to seriously address the quality of their products and redesign most of them, this isn’t the only item I’ve been severely disappointed with from them, you’re much better off going to an Etsy shop and spending a bit more money, it will be a much better investment.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters "machine engraved". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.

The vinyl is very thin and floppy.  The wooden skewers that are glued to the vinyl of course get cake icing on them making you wonder if it is safe to use again.  This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.

Within hours parts of it were soaked and the debris such as hay, straw pellets and poop would not entirely sweep up because they were sticking to the wet spots. Within a day I had to change the cage back to the paper bedding I was using because it stunk. The positive points are - it is a very cute print, is well sewn and thick. It was a generous size with some material left over.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with "Our Anniversary"  [our names] and  [date]  with  "25 years  and Counting".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  "Magnetic" pages is just a new name for old school "press & stick" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought this product with no inscription just the blank bar to use layered with other necklaces. Within a week the bar has lost it's &#34;shine&#34; and looks dull next to other silver items. Not satisfied for the price spent.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: La verdad. No me gustó!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The necklace is cute but I don't recommend because it pulls hair terribly. It's the type of chain the wraps up in your hair and janks it out. If there was a different chain this would be 5 stars.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: There's a similar appearing item on etsy that is much more substantial for only $5 more, a very high quality and structured bag.

The embroidery is nice though, unfortunately however that makes it unreturnable.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I really do not like writing bad reviews, but these earrings were not it for me. They irritated my ears badly (but I do have very sensitive skin) and I cannot wear them anymore. I am not sure if I put them in wrong and closed them wrong when they were in my ears but the little opening always got stuck inside my ear. I was very hopeful but they did not work out for me. I would say that if you have sensitive ears, do not buy these.

After wearing it for just a few months the charm discolored, that was a big disappointment. I changed the band. When I went back to use the Silver Metal Band the latch didn't snap back on. Its no good. I couldn't believe it. I probably use it for about 5 months, once I removed it that was it. I haven't been able to use it :/

So I took a chance thinking that somebody would have the forethought not to put the tools on a no diving sign. I would return the damn thing but I needed it for insurance purposes. Somebody needs to pull their head out of their bottom and think about their customers needs! Who in the hell would want wrenches and screwdrivers on a simple sign that says no diving shallow.

I would not recommend buying this unless you plan on not washing it....which is gross!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This poster is cute but does stay up. It’s expensive too plus you have to pay almost 8 dollars for shipping. Your look at spending close to 40$ for something that does not stick. It fell off the wall and got all rolled up during the night and picked up residue and stuff from my carpet and is no good now. I tried opening it carefully and it’s messed up . For the money I spent, it’s not worth it. I wanted to buy another one but it’s too expensive for something that does not stick. I’m very disappointed.

She soon passed afterwards, and I spent money on this--for nothing.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Probably should have read the reviews first. I was expecting something metal for it to be "LPL style."<br /><br />For the price, plastic makes more sense, but the quality is pretty lame. It's poorly a poor quality 3D print job. It feels incredibly cheap, and the "resolution" is pretty terrible. It's covered in coarse lines all over.<br /><br />Just buy your own 3D printer and make your own. Then you'll have a 3D printer!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These are so much smaller than described. I measured mine and mine aren't even 11 inches long. Paid way too much money for a block of wood and mason jar. I could have done a better job making this myself.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have had these earrings in my wishlist for over a year and finally decided to buy them for myself, so I was beyond disappointed when I received them. I opened them and instantly noticed that they are completely tarnished! I ordered silver on silver, but as you can see from the picture they are not silver! I was also disappointed by the look of them, they are much larger than I was expecting and they look cheaply made. I will be returning for a refund because even if they weren’t tarnished I am not happy with them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: When I first reviewed this ring I gave it 5 stars and said it was exactly what I wanted.  Well I have changed my mind.  When I first recieved this ring it was a beautiful shiny gold. I wore it for an hour then put it back in the box it came in.  A few days later when I go to wear the ring, to my surprise it is now a tarnished almost copper gold.  Very dissapointed.  Bought a similar ring from different seller and same thing happened.  No more gold filled rings for me.

Additionally, the flower design is a pretty thin cut-out just tacked onto the top of a cylinder band which is not the craftsmanship I was hoping for.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!!

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: First one the metal loop that the lace goes through was crooked and it would hang at an angle. Looked odd. Tried to bend it back and it snapped like cheap plastic. Sent it back and got another one. Straight this time but the metal loop was slightly off center. Looked much better hanging though so I was happy with it until the screw that goes into the pendant just came out on its own. Probably could fix it with super glue but at this point I don't even care. Save your money and buy from a different manufacturer.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Was so excited to finally go from a stud to a hoop. I ordered a size too small the first time, so I ordered a bigger size and it fit perfectly! I noticed right away it was kind of uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to it being something new and irritation from changing to a hoop. Well 9 hours later my nose is forming a bump where the hole is and it's even more irritating, itching and starting to get uncomfortable. I sadly have to take it out before it gets too bad! I guess it will be a stud for now. I never had an issue with nose bones, which is what i like to use. This is the first time I had an issue with jewelry. Just something to think about if you're on the fence about ordering one of these.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The printed graphics/image weren't centered on the page and were actually cut off on the edges -- not by much but if I am paying 15 dollars for this item I expect it to look like it was professionally done. Disappointed. And, after deciding I wanted to return it, I discovered the return shipping is taken out of my refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Didn’t like it. It was printed on flimsy photo paper and cost $10.99.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I just loved this cover...but it allowed my screen protector to crack twice.  First time I thought it must've been due to a drop, but didn't recall it ever dropping.  I got a warranty replacement for my screen protector and the very next day I heard it crack!  All I did is put my phone down face down. The bumpers on the side didn't protect it at all as the edges of the protector was scratched up as well. I don't dare have a phone without a screen protector so this beautiful case just doesn't work for me...but I sure wish it did. Because I already got a warranty replacement for the first one, I have to pay bucks to pay for another protector...and a new case. I understand I won't get a full refund because it's been used some, so I'm doubly screwed.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: UPDATE: Unfortunately, the bracelet broke over the weekend of 02/24/2023 the rattail cording snapped, and my teen lost 5 of the 6 beads that were released when the bracelet broke. Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These are lovely wire earrings. However, the wire is very thin and delicate. It was extremely difficult to put the clear earring backs that came with them on. The amount of force it took to get the backs onto the wire and then up to the point behind the ear bent the wire completely out of shape. I was so disappointed because they are beautiful earrings. It seems like they are the wrong size. The hole was too small to easily glide onto the wire. Since the back part of the wire is visible and an integral part of the overall design, there isn't a way to regain the delicate curve. I really liked these earrings, but sadly the wire just doesn't hold up.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It's nicely sewn but... I certainly expect more for the money. It's the old time style where holder is split" in middle. There's still enough opening to get debris inside holder and onto tissue. Flimsy cotton. *Cute* kitties though.<br />On photo it looked like holder had a flap and I'd have to open to pull tissue out. Not as convenient as this style but better. I can see this getting lots of lint, dust or whatever into and on holder/tissue; plus I'd be washing it a lot. Not worth it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Tags are nice, however there are not 24 different designs as the description would leave you to believe: “In a set, you will receive 24 Vintage Inspired Victorian Christmas Gift Tags, prestrung with gold ribbon.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the ring at first.. it was a nice size and it fit well. I loved watching it change colors. not even a week after I bought it the stone fell right off. and no amount of super glue in the world would hold it together.. very disappointed

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: [[VIDEOID:f134aab89272a571c23d06ad0e28093b]] Pensaba usarlos para celebrar el cumple de mis hijos en Disney, llegaron con un olor muy fuerte y por eso los lavé inmediatamente, entonces pasó esto, se mancharon y sencillamente no podré usarlos, muy caros para la calidad tan mala, estoy muy disgustada y recomendaría no comprarlos.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I wanted to love this mask.  (Well...as much as anyone can "love" a mask, lol!)<br />The rooster applique is beautiful.<br />However, I also want a mask to be somewhat, well, *practical.*  The fit is horrible.  It gapes.  Just pulling it more against the face does not fix the fitting problem.  I am so bummed.  It is the worst fitting mask I've every tried.  The package says on it that once open, it cannot be returned for sanitary reasons.  I understand...but there was no way I was going to know how it fit until *after* I opened the package.  As it is, perhaps I'll purchase another black mask from a maker that I have already seen makes a well-fitting mask, and move the rooster applique to that mask.  :(

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I wish I had known before purchasing that this was going to be sheer/see through. Tried wearing a tank top under it, a white bra, everything and it just didn't look like. Even with pasties on, those show through.<br /><br />I wanted to support small business and they left a cute note with the shirt but I was still highly disappointed. Just be aware that its completly sheer and see through before purchasing.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is pretty,  but very very flimsy..
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I didn’t realize how tiny this would be. The picture makes it look so big, and honestly it was the size of my finger nail. And the embossed leave with your initial is so faint it is sort of pointless. I also don’t believe it is genuine turquoise, which is the stone I ordered. It sounds like plastic resin when you tap on it. I also spent more money upgrading to the sterling silver chain, and sterling silver always has to be indicated with the 925 label. The chain doesn’t look like sterling silver at all. I pretty much feel like I got ripped off. I ended up going to a different store and buying a legitimate turquoise necklace.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I thought the product was terrible. I have used Rape many times before, and have found this to be awful. Purchasing it from a reliable source like Four visions, it is a much better product. Four visions supplies an original version of the Amazonian Rape
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Locket is way too small for pictures or any momentum. Both chain and rope chain broke very easily. The heart itself was pretty and unique, but not made for any pictures. Not worth the 80 something dollars I paid for it. Wanted it to place some hair of my dead husband into.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Wore them for 2 weeks on and off during the holiday. I purchase the blue and green color in cold metal. The gold was vibrant sort of like the 24k hold color. Then it faded after washing my hands a couple times to the point where the colors were un even. I had yellow and white metal showing through. As much as loved the rings I could not justify the price of $100 for both
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Broke the first time I used it
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived in a thin shipping cardboardish shipping envelope stuffed in a plastic shipping bag. Results, photo with several creases and bends in it. To think it took more than a week to rcv a damaged poorly printed, photo. Id been far better off printing this out from my home printer working from a screenshot of the product. Couldn't be more disappointed in the overall quality and lack of care that was took when packaging for shipment. Had this been put inside a cardboard box with bubble wrap and the box arrived beat up and damaged, I would understand that it was likely the shipping company that done this, however this was clearly a lack of care by the seller because of the manner in which it left their possession in the first place. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I want to return this item. The earrings are  nice but unfortunately you have not detailed that they are for small children since it is impossible for an older person to put them on. There are very tiny.  Amazon is having many sellers who don't respect  customer satisfaction. I hope you are not one of them. I can't understand why they are so troublesome to return less than $20.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I knew what I was getting on quality. What I did not realize, and now do somewhat by looking at item more online, is that there is a faint design on the photo paper that makes the background look dirty. I actually tried to wipe it off! It does not compliment the other design elements on the print. I don't even think I could display. Impulse purchase that I regret.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Should be for a set of 4. Overpriced!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Totally my fault. I bought the wrong type of ring. I thought it was a belly ring.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I initially loved this product! It was high gloss, had super rich colors, a deep black background, and sturdy weight. By the six week mark, the colors drastically started to fade. The rich black background turned a peachy color. I contacted the seller. They quickly sent me a replacement. Then.... six more weeks passed and the same thing happened! It is hanging in my office and receives no direct sunlight. I’m highly disappointed. The seller gave me the option of returning the item for a refund. I opted not to due to the cost of return shipping.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so excited to get this but no matter how many times I tried, I couldn't get my name and the RN to line up. Yes I did watch the video & did everything thr way she said. The RN and charm ALWAYS ended up on the other side. I manipulated it 4 or 5 times and that was enough to crease the product. No hammer. No tools. Just creased. I would fond a more quality product.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered this as a gift for my 6ft 1” son. There’s no way it could be taken off over his head without disconnecting it. It would also sit really high up under his chin, it’s very very short. It might be better with foil if the foil doesn’t come off. He opened it at Christmas and looked it over, never even realizing it was monogrammed at all. I had to tell him was and that it was monogrammed so he could look closer. He’s young and has good eyesight and still couldn’t see it in a normally lit room. If you hold it up to the light at an angle you can make it out but I was super disappointed. It was not the custom cool little accessory I hoped for. I should have inspected it before I stuck it in the bag with his other stuff. He was so impressed that I found it still here at clean up time the next day sitting on end table. The strap I got really doesn’t fit the scale of the item pictured.<br />So in summary, the monogram is too shallow to be seen , strap too rough cut and short to make this the nice strap you will be expecting. If you buy this you might feel embarrassed like I was.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not what I expected. When you say plated, you get the impression that it will be on some sort of metal. Ex, brass, nickel, copper... but this is thin plastic.

The "pearl" isn't even good costume jewelry, and the paint was flaking off when it arrived.

The description says it doesnt come with a frame, "but why would it need one?" Or, that was my thought when I bought it. So yes, I was surprised and disappointed that I payed over $13... for a photo.  We will try to make it work for what we planned but it likely was just $13 I wasted.  I am not returning it, as there was nothing wrong with it.  It just was not what I expected, I purchase.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This necklace was ordered for me as a gift. This necklace seems well made, but it is not plated well. Within an hour of wearing it turned my whole chest black. I have written to them twice now and they refuse to respond. Not worth the effort.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This ring was so small I could not even see the floral details and it wasn't dimensional like you see in the photo.  It would be good for a little girl's first ring but not an adult.  I returned it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For $18 this is super expensive for the small size and detail of this item.  I wanted a bulb not a disc.  I submitted a return within a  minute of opening it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: First off, I love how the lettering looks, and was very excited to put it in my little girls loft. The wall I tried to put this on is only a little bit textured and the name didn’t even try to stick! I was so disappointed. I followed the directions, waited, and nothing! It just sucks that I’m out the money now and all I have is a tail. There should be something somewhere saying only buy this if you plan to put the name on a completely flat and smooth surface.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 4in cookie cutter. The size is in the length and not the diameter so the cookie cutter is small compared to other 4in cutters.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Got holes in it very easily and it's much shorter than in the picture.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It is so small that it will not show up at all on bracelet. The price was too much for what you get. Not pleased at all. The size stone would be better on the teddy bear next to it like on the advertisement instead of by itself.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This case does not hold the 2 fluid ounce paint bottles as advertised and I have several different brands. It did not work for any of them. It was also very difficult to put together and you need super glue. Definitely overpriced for what it is.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Hi, I recently bought 3 sterling silver bracelets from you in July 2022. All 3 identical, 1 for myself and the other two for friends. This for me, just graduating college was a lot to spend. I was so excited when I received them. They were beautiful. But,  as I’ve worn mine daily since 7/29/22, the metal around the gems is red. Your website claimed the item to be sterling silver (925). I’m so disappointed and embarrassed since I gave the other two as gifts and they are in the same shape as mine. What a shamble. Annoyed and embarrassed.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This item was not as big as it appeared and the material is awful! The design is nice but don’t wash it w other items bc it runs.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: First the delivery took much longer than expected. It came in a week late, which was frustrating because I went with them because of the estimated delivery dates. Also you should not try to repostion the decals once you put it on the cup, mine came apart and the letter broke. Other than those two things, the decals looked great, loved the lettering and the colors!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I would have returned it if I had not opened it. The problem is that the picture on Amazon shows three balls on the wire , whereas the product I received had only 1 Pearl and 1 gold ball. It’s missing a gold ball (see attached image)
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These earrings are adorable but unfortunately the orange part disconnected from the silver fox on one of the earrings - about 3 hours into my first time wearing them. Very disappointing!
