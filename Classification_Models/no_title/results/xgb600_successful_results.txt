True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Soft, true to size
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It’s pretty but it’s small
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: As described but packaging could have been better for the price
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a complete rip off!!!  Don't waste your $$ or time!  It turned within a few days of wearing it!!!!!!!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE, DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!!!!!!!!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Slightly blurry and it’s just a sticker over the blade couldn’t use the blade for anything. I know it’s to be collected but I still expect a knife to have a usable blade.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Ok but smaller than we thought.  Always read the measurements!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It's kind of chunky and it bumped it falls apart but for the most part it stays together and does his job but it just looks a little ghetto and really big
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very bad made broke same day my daughter got it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It was not what I expected
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Poorly made. The clasp broke after one wearing.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality fabric messy writing<br />Looks like a felt pin was used<br />Plus totally gross a black hair was inside when I unfolded it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: What I got was really awful. It was not hand printed, it was computer generated, and in addition several words were misspelled. These folks took a great concept; got in a hurry and totally ruined it. So sad because it was a great idea. They probably should have charged more and done it right.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Many of the stars where misfired they did not even look close to stars, the instruction video show a piece to install the stickers and it did not come with one.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It is just a photo printed. Same thing you could do at Walmart for a few cents. The print is a nice print, but not close to being worth 13 dollars. Maybe $1.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Will not fit average adult wrist, very small
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I thought this would be something other than just a peice of photo paper - wrong! Just type this up yourself and go to Walmart to print it. It will be the same thing and cheaper.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: You just as well kiss a five dollar and see if it sticks to anything. All you're doing is wasting five dollars.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: This is not at all what I believed it to be.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is not what the picture is. I’m upset it’s a rooster. And it’s not easy to stamp the egg. I would have been fine with it not stamping correctly it’s for my daughter but I didn’t want to stamp out eggs with a rooster when in the pictures it’s a hen.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It was just a few prints. Nothing special. I guess you get what you pay for.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Unfortunately I am not very satisfied with my necklace that my husband got me for Mother’s Day as cute as it is it’s very delicate and it broke and I’ve only had it for like five weeks so I would highly recommend NOT buying this necklace!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Smells nothing like a pipe or even what's in the description.  They smell like Werther's caramel.  Very disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not Kawaii- knock off; tiny container.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: it was so so thin narrow ring.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: They were thin and danity, which is what i wanted.. but if you plan on taking them on and off every day, good luck! They are very thin, extremely hard to latch and they bend and distort very easily. I could make these at home with some wire for less then what i paid for these. Save your money!!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Letters are super small and light weight. A complete waste of $60! Does not look anything like the advertisement. Very dissatisfied and seller will not let me return!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very frail, broke easily. Should be sold for less.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The quality of the chain is fine but the arrow itself looks like it was already used and seemed oxidized. You can even see it that they both are different colors. Maybe I’ve got a copy that was returned before. I don’t know but I was disappointed
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Leaves a sticky feel on my hair and has a weird smell that's unplesant.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth buying
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cheap quality. The bracelet didn’t even last me two months.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them. I've worn backless shoes many times, & could easily keep them on. These do not stay on my feet! Sad thing is, they are non returnable!!! What a rip off! Guess I learned my lesson!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Lightweight earring but they keep twisting backwards and getting caught or twisted within the post
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to… And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Lo compre en octubre para regalo de Navidad de mi esposo y para sorpresa extremadamente pequeño y nada que ver para el precio, pobre calidad, el vendedor nada que te ayuda simplemente aun diciendole que esta nuevo en su cajita no acepta la devolucion por estar pasado de tiempo. Nada profesional al menos podia ayudar al cliente aunque hiciera un descuento. NO RECOMIENDO HACERLE COMPRAS A ESTE VENDEDOR. 👎👎👎
