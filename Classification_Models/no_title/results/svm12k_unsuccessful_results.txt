True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Product is NOT as described...  Save your money on this one!!  Map is severely cropped...
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is a complete rip off!!!  Don't waste your $$ or time!  It turned within a few days of wearing it!!!!!!!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE, DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!!!!!!!!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not happy it was a bad purchase
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Slightly blurry and it’s just a sticker over the blade couldn’t use the blade for anything. I know it’s to be collected but I still expect a knife to have a usable blade.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very bad made broke same day my daughter got it
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: "not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: it was so so thin narrow ring.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Was great until I was exfoliating in the shower. Long story short, it broke after 2 weeks
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth buying
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap quality. The bracelet didn’t even last me two months.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It has a bad smelling undertone that makes the whole house stink. It does initially smell like lemons, but after a few minutes smells really bad (waxy/rotten fruit/sour).
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: if you are ordering this for a small child, this would be great.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: What you see here is NOT what you get. It's more of a necklace pendant rather than a dog/cat tag. And i say necklace beacise they literally sent me a necklace. I only will not be returning this beacuse it does have my info on the tag so it will suffice so that my cat can roam. But really they advertise this product the worng way.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The picture of the stackable rings is very misleading. The rope ring is great but the solid one is a very cheap thin piece of copper wire. Would never purchase from this vendor again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The chain is really cheap, so it broke the second day I wore it . I lost one of the jewels when it broke. Disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Miniature sized, like a toy.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: A friend bought these for me for my recent birthday. The image was originally three bears. After rcpt, the image shows four, but the description still says three pieces. The seller refused to ship the missing pic (blue). So, now I have an incomplete set.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I really did love the earrings, unfortunately, I lost one the 2 nd day I wore them. The back had come loose earlier that day, but I felt it. The next time, I didn’t even know until someone said it was missing. So bummed.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this for my kid for school to help her stay focused. It still worked iyt for her but only lasted 2 days when it broke off.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...?? I'm disappointed in the price for the quality that was received, as I do not believe it is real silver .....
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The scent lasts through several uses, but the scent is more like a soap than Eucalyptus/Mint. I don't smell either.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: These were meant to look vintage, and looked really good in the photos on Amazon. These are printed on glossy photo paper. Not at all what the description stated as "Vintage". If they were not for a Bosses day gift, and I had more time, I would have returned them.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Yes it's comfortable and lightweight, but I am disappointed. The beads were glued off centered so it did not look cute at all because it wasn't centered.<br /><br />Shame. :(
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Broke the first few days I’m very disappointed. It hangs by a needle. It’s pretty but for spending $28 on a necklace that hangs by a needle that breaks in a few days really upsets me.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For the price it's ok but the labradorite has zero flash so I'm a little disappointed in these earrings.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The design of this needle minder is very cute. However, the magnet is so weak! It barely keeps a needle on and doesn't attract my scissors and keep them on like my other minders do. Disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: They do not stick fully. They are now peeling from the wall. I guess i cant return because they ate half stuck so ill have to make believe its a 3d effect of the flowers and leafs curling
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very thin braids, are darkish brown in color and have literally no scent to them. Kinda ratty. I prefer braids to be fragrant, fresh and braided a bit thicker with more than a few strands of grass. These ones are very brittle and fragile.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: You get what you pay for! Lesson I need to learn
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very well made but because of size very difficult to install always bubbles
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I would make sure you buy the biggest size because for 17 bucks you get a tiny sticker which in my opinion is not worth it for the price!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I Didn't realize when I chose a thread color that it would all be that color. I chose navy and even the flowers were in navy. I figured the flowers would stay pink (like in the listing picture). Also, the flowers in the picture are different (and are way better looking) than the flowers on the one I received. I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not at pictured.  Plain white glossy paper.  No edging as pictured.  Very expensive for what it is.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I had to pay shipping for another one because the original broke trying to get it off the cardboard. Way too much glue used for shipping.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cheaply made. Flimsy plastic, not chalkboard material as described. Sending it back immediately.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Tried it on muscle back pain,  didn't work. Tried it on headache, alleviated a bit.  Also, container is not easy to use when trying to rub it on your side, for instance, because you have to keep your finger pushing the roll because otherwise, as you rub, it slides close again.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The earrings tarnished almost immediately. I wore them once. Not worth buying.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I realize that anything personalized cost more but, this item is very delicate and not top quality for the price.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Wires are very thin and bend easily.  They also work their way out of my ear, and I have almost lost them a couple of times.  Not my favorite earrings due to the poor quality.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I tried to get used to the smell but I can’t. This smells really bad and it reminds me of cheap incense. Nothing about it smells like vanilla.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Fantastic quality, very adorable. My issue was with ship time. It states to allow 1-2 weeks for your package to arrive. However, it Took 4 weeks for just the hat to be delievered. I ordered it 3 weeks before my sons newborn pictures expecting it to arrive well before. Causing us to have to have the photos taken without it. I’m hoping it still fits at his next photo session, but it is on the smaller side so I am not sure
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They are cute run small and if u need them for a certain date you better order a month ahead of time. Took over  4 weeks to arrive.. Ridiculous

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Guess I should have read the description. Literally $15 for a picture pritened on a peice of paper. I could have done that myself for way cheaper. Plus I thought they were printed on canvases and now I have to go spend more money for frames.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: There are multiple flaws in the craftsmanship . Black marks that were very noticeable in multiple areas. There were multiple splinters in the crevices as well. Wood is thin . Seller agreed to a return with a “ restocking fee”. This was a gift that I am unable to give. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Returned. It’s not a kitchen towel, it looks like a decor.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful Sterling Silver chain but the main feature of this necklace, the Harmony Ball, is NOT Sterling Silver. It is tarnishing after just a few weeks of wear. I've tried to polish it with Sterling silver paste with no improvement. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text:  
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 2 of these. One for me and 1 for my work bestie. We have different names and I placed the order accordingly. I got 2 shirts with HER name and 0 shirts with my name. The seller ignored my messages to discuss the order, mistake, and what we could do moving forward.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: They were a pretty gold color when I got them, but after a few months, they are a dull silvery color. Maybe it’s my fault for wearing them continuously, including in the shower. They are very lightweight.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I ordered from  Country barn babe because  all the reviews were great and all five stars. I guess I didn't have as good a luck. Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This sign was very well-made and is on a thick piece of wood, but for some reason there was a square brown stain around the whole word “bakery” and in between the letters.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too bulky
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: While the hoop is very cute and dainty, the hoops did turn colors after a month or two. I am not satisfied with this purchase, because the “sterling silver” turned black. The sizing is great in my double helix but they quickly changed tone.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The problem I had with this product was no piercer was willing to put it in for me. The end was snipped off that would go in your nose. It wasn’t tapered but a flat end. Would have been painful too put it in . It looks pretty! I just wish I could wear it
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Very cool looking,  however , we cant take it off the wall because  it won't stick ! Left it on for a month and still won't stick
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The products were cheaply made. The word family was broken. Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It was so small that it barely fit around the nostril. It was very thin, which is fine, but the diameter was sooo extremely tiny that it did not look good.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I needed to use this for my husband man cave.. but when I received the order it didn’t look like his name Ike.. so I can’t use it.. the first letter is off. The craftsmanship was nice but other than that I wasn’t too happy.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall.

I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6" tall and the other 5" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to "make it work" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The seller did not state that the image is not in the center of the towel. It is near the left edge of the towel. This makes it difficult to hang as a decorative towels to hang in the bathroom or on the oven. I am disappointed.-
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I gave this purchase 1 star because I ordered it October 14th.  Our Son's wedding was on October 24th.  The card arrived on October 26th, (Too Late)  Very disappointed.  While we know it's not your fault, you might want to rethink your current shipping.  It should not take 12 days to receive a card in the mail.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was initially impressed with the design. We kept it in storage in a dark, cool area. Checked on it to put it in our suitcase a couple months later and all the color, especially the black was faded with an ugly purplish/red color. Not that great of quality and we haven't even got to use it for our cruise yet.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The quality of these products are not good. Way overpriced for something that I could buy from the Dollar Tree. Pictures misleading.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: If there was a less than one star option i would have went with that. The product description says this is not very thick at all. The images would lead you to believe this is three dimensional....... it is not..... just a cheap one dimensional paper doll. I would recommend you pay special attn to the description and n I t trust the images. I would return it but it's not worth the time or effort.  Looks like they got me on this one.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I had to add some "fluff" to it to make it look like a special gift.  The idea of it is very cool but there could be some advancements in its presentation.  I wouldn't buy another one
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: GARBAGE! When I opened the box the ends of the headbands were broken and white ribbon used to wrap around the head band was untwined.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Attractive online according to the picture of the fleur de lis on the sellers door; however, it is smaller in reality. Measurements match their description but picture is deceiving! Not big enough. Returning to seller.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Here how it went for my order:<br />took two times longer then expected to get here. Missed the gifting window by a long shot, the writing is super small, the quality is as good as a Mall Stand. Wouldn’t buy again..
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The measurements are wrong.. I got this shirt and it was way too big. Also, the shirt came with just the face the word vibe was not written underneath.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name. I wish the engraving came in a different color or at least a little thicker. Did not meet my expectations like the photos

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: My son is learning to spell his name and thought it would be a great addition to the other puzzle names.  We had purchased for our oldest child.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: It has a coconut derivative in it that’s not listed in this ad for the item: cetearyl alcohol. I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So thin you can see thru it. This would be better for ladies fashion then anything tactical. Ends where ready to split and not tied as a traditional one would be. Have used these in dessert and snow and would only use this to blow my nose.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The chain is a very yellow gold and has no silver accents like the description states. The pendant is more of a warm gold, which doesn’t match, and looks cheap to me. I purchased this for a Birthday present and do not have time to find another gift or give the seller an opportunity to remake. Very disappointed.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with. Please be careful and be aware of this when ordering your pendant.<br />I would order this again in a heartbeat if the cross coin was a bit larger and much heavier.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Make sure you check the size - this was not at all what I was expecting for the price.  It's the size of a regular sheet of paper.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: These euro shams looked pretty online, but once I received them and put them on my pillows the ruffles folded down and looked terrible displayed on my bed. I am returning them, they either have to be redesigned or show on line that the ruffles don't stay up. I would give them 3 stars but I'm giving them 2 or less because now I have to pay for shipping to return them. Not a good deal. I'll have to do my homework better next time.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The earrings caused an allergic reaction in my ears after wearing for 3 days. The earrings even tarnished in 3 days. After cleaning the pair (because I love the design and fit!) one earring remains "pitted". See picture. I bought these during the COVID lockdown but will wait until stores re-open to purchase personal items such as earrings. Expensive lesson learned.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not sticky enough so peels at various points (on the plus side, it's easy to remove). Didn't quite fit Quest so first had to be trimmed and it just doesn't lay right on non-flat headset surface.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This product is not worth it,  very hard to take off paper and transfer to wall.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The idea is great BUT when you leave on the mail box for a pick up and it rains ..... it rusts and is eventually<br />unreadable. It only took two rains to start the rusting.<br />Good idea but should have been tested first!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not what was pictured. I wanted something oddly shaped like the description showed. This is not the ring I ordered. Also, the back where it sits against my finger is uneven and sharp and scratches my finger. Very disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheap and SHARP!! A waste of money. Not functional or worth showing
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so DISAPPOINTED  qhwn I saw the size. What a waste.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Picture doesn’t come with frame as shown on  Amazon. So you’re paying $30 for a glorified poster. I have lost faith in Amazon this will be my last purchase through them.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not buy. You can not get this in. Unless you want to injure yourself and make your nose bleed, like I did. No matter how how I tried or how hard I tried to injure myself, it still won't go in. I have had a nose ring for 15 years, so I'm not new to this. I have used every type of nose ring out there. Don't buy, it's not worth it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Looks cheap and has a really cheap chain.  The cat is fine, but the advertised cat eyes are too small to be seen...  Don't buy it...
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Name spelling was incorrect
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I wore this nose ring for 4 days before the silver completely tarnished. It infected my nose almost instantly. Spend a little more money to buy a gold nose ring that’s actually worth the money.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I wrote a review in regards to this earlier & gave it a 5.  Well, guess what?<br />IT TURNED!<br />IT TURNED!<br />IT TURNED!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!<br />Do not buy!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It arrived horribly bent. Even though the cost was so low, I assumed it would be more substantial than it was in terms of the paper and the the foil, but oh well. Not really worth the $10 for it to arrive like this.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Necklace was nice and attractive but the chain was too short. Would like an option for a longer chain or chain extension b
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Ordered this on the 3rd, received it 2 weeks later. Order tracking was useless and I do not recommend this product or seller. If I could give 0 stars, I would

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Horrible quality chain. Forced me to go to a jeweler to get a better one. Turned green after a few days.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It looks thicker than it is in the picture shown once you put it on It slides off of the top part of the ear. Not that impressed.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Ring sticks up way too high too m a fraud it wld catch on everything. It looks so dainty in the picture.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the size, but it’s now all tarnished and looks off. Not very pretty. Not worth the money

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I understand the sticker was small but the words are way to small to see, useless
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Such a wast of money. This is the smallest flimsiest metal that you can tell they just snipped from a spool of long wire and made circular. Don’t wast your money.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m definitely going to be returning this.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks and feels super cheap, like $10 cheap. I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for. BUT, I had the bracelet personalized and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is UPSIDE DOWN. The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I have other line art that is awesome. This picture is NOT. It looks so amateurish like it was drawn with a thick magic marker. So I returned it and bought the "pinky swear" art piece from another source. So happy with the new one.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: By far the worst phone case ever bough!! the craftsmanship is horrible please be aware of the product before you buy!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The colors are nice and the bracelet is great until it comes to the black rope that ties the anklet together. It looks like a large black spider and it's so thick that you feel it in shoes.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice thick quality glass.  But the engraving has a light unfinished appearance.  Nothing like the photos on the website.  Poor quality engraving
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text:  
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The seller did not have a photo of Michigan on her site. So when I got it, its way smaller than I thought and the word is separate between the upper and lower peninsula and I am not sure if I had seen the sample, I would have bought it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Extremely thin and flimsy item will not stay put. The slightest touch and its gone. I would call it disposable.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The bracelet has no purple color of amethyst at all.  A cheap looking silver dangling clasp which is not displayed  with thread showing through  appears to be holding these so called real stones together. Very disappointing and will return. Just received 10 minutes ago.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!<br />One doesn't even match the other!!!<br />SO ANGRY WITH THIS PURCHASE
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It is very cute, but it arrived broken.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This hat looks nothing like the picture. It’s cheaply made, isn’t sized correctly and plain old stupid looking. Purchased for costumed renaissance faire and didn’t wear because it’s dorky. Pass on this.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not gold. I wore it for two days and my nose started hurting. When I took it out , it was changing colors. Nose was sore for a few days.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap product. Had to bend open to put it in and then bend back once in like a bubble gum machine ring from when you were a kid. Did not fit snug.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These address stickers were stuck to the backing to the point that they wouldn’t come loose and adhere to the metal mailbox. I ended up tearing them up trying to get them to work. It was as if there wasn’t any glue on the address labels themselves.<br />The design was beautiful, but it doesn’t matter how pretty they are if they are in the bottom of your trash can.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: nothing like photograph  not live edge. poorly made rectangle of cheap thin wood. do not purchase
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cute ornament but no time or quality was taken in customizing the ornament and it was a pricey ornament.  I was very disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a gorgeous shoe rack, but I am really disappointed that one of the pieces of wood arrived chipped/damaged (see pictures). I thought maybe it wouldn’t look as noticeable when put together, but it really does. I am hoping seller will read this, as this was rather expensive.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Before I even open the inner wrap... it’s a broken piece.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It is very dainty, but the chain is too small! It is about 16 inches in all, but the chain should be 16 inches before the extra links. Should be meant for a young girl. It does say it's about 15+ inches, but I didn't notice until after purchase.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The pictures on Amazon are bright and colorful. The actual stones are  drab brown. I was so excited to order and so disappointed when I got the jewelry. It is not returnable so be careful when ordering

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I thought the pictures came in a frame but they didn't  so I'm a little disappointed
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheapppppppppppppppp<br /><br />So disappointed the pictures make it look strong and sturdy and over all NOT cheap but it’s so cheaply made and it’s just hot glued on a stick and it curls up and the stick is just tooo small and what a waste of money
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It was not easy to install and didn't stick to well. I didn't like the design.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Just a print out on simple photo paper... Spend the $ .50 and print one yourself.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I am very disappointed. I ordered a second hat that did not have the playing cards and poker chip on the hat...  Can the Company sent it to me??? I will glue it on.  Also, the foam is separating where the different colors of foam meet... Not the quality of the first hat I ordered...
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not what I was expecting. This was literally a copied 8x10 print.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: came apart at connectors,glue wore off after wearing 4 or 5 times.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Although the packaging is cute, that was about all that I enjoy about these. The wood of the match is extremely dry and weak. EVERY match I use breaks. I’ve had 3 matches out of 50 stay in tact. It is very frustrating. Overall, I am not buying these again. I’d recommend you don’t either.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too small, too heavy & bulky

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Looks and feel like plastic earrings.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The candles smell pretty good. A bit disappointed as the smell doesn't last that long. Yankee candle has a longer lasting smell then ChicWick. For thr price i thought these were a little expensive. The one pro was the customer service people were very sweet.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Very short
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: For the price I could’ve done myself. Came in another box that looks like it was damaged so the folder it came in was bent and so were the prints. Waste of money.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This wreath was much smaller than I thought it would be and the fragrance was strong…and not all that pleasant. Plus, it cost over $9 to return. I won’t be purchasing from this seller again.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The size
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It's too small and won't fit on the dock.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They seem like such a fun idea. The size and color of the writing and the font can make them very hard to read.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute dress, name came back incorrectly and having problems getting a mailing label to return the dress. Would not buy from them again.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: When peeling the paper from the clear backing, the vinyl stayed on the paper, and couldn’t apply to window
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Came long after Christmas.  What a waste.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Well, I requested my name to be written correctly and ended up getting all lower case?! Genius who doesn't know names start with a capital letter!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I give this a 1 just because only the tshirt came .didnt get the skirt or the teddy bear or nothing of what is in the pic!!! So i hade to stress matching with a skirt.. either then that the tshirt was ok
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the look of this shirt!  However, the vinyl used is very cheap....feels "crunchy" to touch and I really don't believe it will last through the baseball season.  Not sure why they chose this vinyl...my friend ordered this shirt last year from the same vendor and hers is not like this.  Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very disappointed. Very small -couldn’t be worn by an adult.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: No
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The cross was tiny
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I gave it a 1 star for the color as it matched my bathroom accessories but it is so freaking small! I'm so disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I think it looks pretty cool but would look much better with a glass cylinder to house the light. Also, no hardware to hang is included and although the manufacturer seemed nice, was pretty unhelpful with recommendations. The wire and housing are IKEA. I had to figure out and purchase bracket to hang myself with the help of two electricians.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This bracelet had no color whatsoever...I'm really not convinced they were even opals.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Such a disappointing print of a really great design. The sticker is so dark that you cannot see any of the delicate details - you woildnt know it was a d20 without having seen the image online first! All 3 stickers came out this way. Very dark, very disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Loved the idea of this product, loved being able to spread seeds and have the name on it.  Way to small, hard to read.  Would not recommend unless they increased the size..

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Just go to the store and wrap a circle from wire like material.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: So disappointed.  Three of the items in the gift box were not sealed.  One item looked like it had been a sample, it looked used.  Something leaked inside the box damaging the outside of the gift box.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I knew what I was getting on quality. What I did not realize, and now do somewhat by looking at item more online, is that there is a faint design on the photo paper that makes the background look dirty. I actually tried to wipe it off! It does not compliment the other design elements on the print. I don't even think I could display. Impulse purchase that I regret.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I specifically asked if my remarkable 2 would fit in the case with the cover on.  they assured me it would, you can check the questions.  I eagerly awaited my order only to find that it doesn't actually fit, the case doesn't even come close to latching with the cover on.  I am disappointed in the inaccurate info I received and the return process has proven difficult thus far.  Sad,  a great quality product that is useless isn't really a great product.<br /><br />Anyone that has a remarkable 2 knows you don't want to store it in anything without the remarkable protective cover attached.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is small and cheap and can’t hold much money at all so if all you have is a few and I mean a few dollars then buy it otherwise DONT!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Loved the look but it is just thin paper and too fragile to hang. I laminated it for sturdiness
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought this as a gift, fortunately it came early. One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This ring is well made but the stone was not anywhere near clear. Notified the seller and they refunded my money. I offered to return the ring but was told i did not need to do so.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The fabric on this dress is very thin and see through. The print is very cute but the colors look washed out and not even close to the vibrant print shown in picture. We use it as PJ's.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I am a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan, so I was very excited to see this shirt.  I bought it immediately. My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I feel like I could have bought this at Clair’s for $5. It’s a thin hoop and cute, but such a huge rip off and waste of money!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This product is very very nice looking. However I really expected more than a copy and paste type print.<br />I gave the artist and song title.<br />The print is obviously a cut and paste.<br />Just some common sense punctuation would be great.<br />Pretty much ruins it for us.
