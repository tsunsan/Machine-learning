True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Understanding these are CZ's they are ok quality but they are full round studs, the picture looked more of a square setting.  The screw on backs to these are impossible to screw on! The screw on round backing is WAY to tiny and hard to hold between your fingers just to take a picture, not mention to do this behind your ear?!?!!  I dropped one of the backings on the first time and it rolled into a small crack or hole on my floor to a 4th dimension or black hole... to where I will never find again.  Save your money.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was really enjoying my case but literally three days after having it on my phone the lettering began to chip which made me realize It wouldn‚Äôt be long before it chipped off entirely. As I‚Äôm reading the comments and see that only few people have had this problem I‚Äôll make the assumption that the manufacturers are most likely NOT consistent with their materials. So maybe they temporarily substitute products when they run out of their normal ones ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIdk

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I got this product to prevent scratches on the switch screen which it did do. Unfortunately for this product, screen protectors are its biggest rival since it can do the exact same thing in preventing screen scratches. I got the black one so I cant even use it just for aesthetics. If you get one I highly recommend getting one just for its aesthetics (or if you don't plan on getting a screen protector which I do not recommend not getting one) since now it is kinda useless for me.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was somewhat disappointed in this clock. I had picked out several on Amazon that I liked. Most were around $18 with free shipping. This was $23 plus $9.50 shipping. Given the higher price, I had hoped for a better product. It was exactly as advertised but certainly not worth the extra $5 plus shipping cost. I ended up buying an inexpensive clock from another store and adding its frame and glass cover to improve the appearance. So my total cost was $46. I did contact the vendor but got no response after waiting two weeks to write this review.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: An egg is rounded and larger at one end than at the other.  There is no place to stamp a flat stamp.  They did say it was a "flat" stamp but they also showed a picture of it beautifully stamped on an egg.  I tried everything and no way did I get more than part of the stamp on an egg.  The egg would have to be huge (like an ostrich egg, lol).  The stamp is cute and works well on paper or on an egg carton, so there are uses for it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I gave it 3 stars because the picture shows it mounted on a wood and the description stated its mounted with screws.  The metal item itself is beautiful but it's not mounted on anything so now I have to send it back or find a piece of wood, cut, stain, finish and mount the item myself. A lot more work than I planned for that's why I orderd it handmade so someone can do that for me. I love the peice but it's not complete.  Had the description stated that and wanted to do additional work then I may have given it a better review.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Excellent cnc cuts on all of the components and it was well packaged. No damage and the custom laser work was spot on. The ONLY suggestion I would make is to offer options for the hands, out of the box it comes with black hour and minute hands, which are nice and right sized, but the sweeping second hand is fire engine red. I think offering a choice of hand designs/colors would put that last finished touch on the piece. Otherwise, great product.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: The materials and build quality of this particular pocket organizer are exceptional.  The brown leather is thick, durable and carries well.  The leather has worn around my tools and even holds the shape once they‚Äôre removed.  Placing them back in elicits an audible sound that I can only describe as comparable to holstering a firearm or knife into a good kydex holster.<br /><br />The materials supersede the price.  I have several of their products and will continue to be a repeat customer.  The products also arrived earlier than listed.<br /><br />***It should be noted that there‚Äôs a significant different in the thickness and quality of the brown leathers they use and the black ones.  Black leather is much thinner and doesn‚Äôt hold up as well as the thicker brown options. Sticking is also kinda loose due to the weaker leather. Attached photos show some of the differences in thickness.  There is a significant step DOWN in quality when ordering the black leather version of this product.<br /><br />5 stars for the brown version<br />2 stars for the black version

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I‚Äôm very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn‚Äôt been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle‚Äôs leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn‚Äôt visible I‚Äôm not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I‚Äôm not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn‚Äôt the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can‚Äôt recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Exactly what I was looking for, and the image with size comparison is accurate.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Really good quality. The leather is very soft. I wish the initials were a little bigger but my son likes the size.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This was a replacement for a Mood Stone that was from the 1970's, and this model was an  excellent choice and just the exact size that I was trying to find !!!!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Initially, I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be silver but was clear. I do still love it.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The pops of color on each print make for a unique piece with which to decorate your home.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I have a big wrist and this works perfectly.  It's sooooo sparkly and pretty-- almost a little overwhelmingly.  I think I need to go smaller if I want something for every day wear.  The blue is super bright and it's lovely!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I am so impressed with this necklace. The quality of the stone is beautiful, with a rich golden color and milky white. Good vibes too. The wiring is strong for every day use. I will def buy from this vendor again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs small
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to‚Ä¶ And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I‚Äôm stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: if you are ordering this for a small child, this would be great.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty but too heavy for me
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture of the stackable rings is very misleading. The rope ring is great but the solid one is a very cheap thin piece of copper wire. Would never purchase from this vendor again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not what I thought
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These are just the prints, do not come framed
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Although packaging was great and the print is great it just doesn't seem like the price fits the product.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It‚Äôs okay nothing much to rave about
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Okay so this slime was good but I noticed it smelled like they made it with paint, and the more I played with it the more the bead come out . But it‚Äôs a good product .
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: There are much better and bigger spa sets that are worth the price listed. This was a smaller than expected set. Nothing extraordinary to result in the price listed. I wouldn‚Äôt have even thought this was worth half the price it is selling for. Everything was miniature. Disappointing
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Sticker looks great but didnt transfer the numbers, i tried multiple times with no luck.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Great bag. Fast delivery. Embroidery looks great. The ribbon color does not match the embroidery at all.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It seems to be a nice product, it is a disappointment that it is not a page from the dictory that gives the definitions of "home"
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I love this pin, but one of the posts snapped off the first day I wore it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These rings are tiny, like made for a child's hand definitely not adult size. Ridiculous for the price, hand crafted means imperfections...I returned mine and at least they gave me no problems with that except I had to pay the return postage.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Much better and nicer than I expected. It‚Äôs realkt top notch.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very well made wood canvas, I used it for string art and I am very satisfied with outcome.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: A+++
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The pin was amazing.  It is wooden not enamel as I assumed.  All around fantastic product!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It was as described and makes a nice addition to my beer glasses which we use for everything but beer!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very cute! I do wish there was an option to pick the symbols that I wanted because I asked for a nautical symbol and got an anchor when I wanted a compass haha. Very quick service and a nice quality for the price.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Really nice. I have gotten stares and compliments.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Soft, true to size
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It's pretty BUT can definitely ruin your paint
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Came late, bent up and parts unglued
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn‚Äôt ideal to travel.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: They are not beaded.. they are plain earrings. They are nice, but not what I bought.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Impossible to put on
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It was uncomfortable! It's just not for me.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The colors are not the same. Pretty necklace. Probably paid too much.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought it for my sister-in-law for Christmas, I really like the design of it. She liked it too! But the chain looks cheap for what I paid for it. Hopefully it's not a cheap chain and it doesn't break!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: My daughter loved them. She wore them all the time but they broke & cannot close. Gotta order another pair.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: This smells great and really softens my lips. Will keep it handy this winter.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Great picture
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought 2 pillows, and the quality and design put pier 1 and Target and other stores to shame. They shipped quickly too! I will definitely be back to shop.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: These are great, I like them a lot.  They come in a nice box and they are very comfortable to wear and don't slip.  It's 2 bracelets, one bracelet has 2 rows of beads and one bracelet has 1 row of beads.  The tiger's eye is very shiny and pretty against the matte lava stones.  Very happy with these.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful workmanship and worth every penny. Would definitely order something else.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I wanted this a bit customized.  I added a color stone and a couple more letters.  I had to contact the seller to figure out how to do the add-on's.  Basically, she has them available, but you need to add them to the same initial order.  It turned out great.  My wife likes it.  I am very happy with this.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Everything about it is perfect except for the string; the one chosen makes the piece rather breakable, especially if using them as mala/prayer beads. On the plus side, it also makes using it as such very quiet which is useful if you meditate at times where it was best you weren't a nuisance (small spaces, late hours).. Being smaller beads, it is also a bit more classy, and less in your face than most mala beads, for if you wish to use it in public without as much judgment from others
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I truly like this product however the discs are way too small to write on.  I have a granddaughter Cheyenne and grandson Christian these name are long and you really can‚Äôt fit them in the very small disc that come with the plaque.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It‚Äôs a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There‚Äôs no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I‚Äôm disappointed but, it‚Äôs still beautiful to look at.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men‚Äôs pockets.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too strong  I couldn't stand it
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The engraving was sloppy
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Turned my finger black after 2 days, not good quality, do not buy
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really did love the earrings, unfortunately, I lost one the 2 nd day I wore them. The back had come loose earlier that day, but I felt it. The next time, I didn‚Äôt even know until someone said it was missing. So bummed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I wanted this necklace for years! I finally bought it for myself.<br /> My biggest complaint is upon arrival it took my at least an hour to unravel the chain. There is no reason I should have to spend the amount of time getting the chain apart from itself.<br />Another huge issue is two weeks later I notice when I went to put the necklace on it seemed to be tarnished a bit on the WW piece. It had been hanging up alone and there is no reason in two weeks it should be 'tarnished' so quickly. It's sterling but I have had pieces that sit for months and months that don't need cleaned. I have fake pieces even that don't change.<br />This wasn't a 10 or 20 dollar piece. If I hadn't waited so very long for this piece and had such high hopes and didn't pay over 30 dollars for it I wouldn't be so harsh on my review. But I was so excited about this for so long to get this for myself for so many reasons and for it not to be better quality upon arrival is very disappointing.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text:  
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: While it is a pretty ring and I like the idea of recycling, repurposing, etc., I was disappointed in the ring.  The band is narrower and the stone smaller than the photos implied.  Should have cost less than I paid.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Product arrived bent. Was way more of an oval then a hoop. Looks funky on because she was not correct
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I've been wanting a way to track our children's growth that could move with us from house to house. I could never find just the right one until now. This is beautiful! We chose a dark wood with white painting and upgraded to the engraved marks and wording. It's perfect! Absolutely spend the extra money and get it engraved. It looks wonderful on our wall and will be cherished for years to come!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty and delicate!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cutest little bat necklace. Wore it all October and was perfect.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Loved it but was going to use it as a Baby shower keepsake with guests thumb prints and signatures  on a mat that would frame it and I  ordered it too small. So I  ordered a bigger one that was one elephant holding a balloon.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Better than I hoped. We live on a walking path and just had some trees planted. Some owners think the yard is their dog‚Äôs toilet so I wanted to get the point across without being obnoxious. It‚Äôs worked perfectly and I think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre bright/friendly and not a crude message like so many signs. Hand painted too - each one is a little different. They‚Äôre sturdy and thick and both are holding up in the rain. Happy to recommend.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very nicely made
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Just as expected. It looks nice in the pic... and it is very nice. Well packed, and easy to install, works great!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I like the peridot earrings very much, they are a nice color. I bought them for my granddaughter's 7th birthday as she recently got her ears pierced.  When she opened the box she was very happy!
