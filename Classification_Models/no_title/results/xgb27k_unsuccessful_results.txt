True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: This name tag broke the same day we got it. I was so sad since it was beautiful but it took 2-3 weeks to receive which I expect for a custom made tag. But it was cheap and broke very easily. We couldn’t even fix it to make it work the tag broke right at the rim so if we drilled a hole they it to make it work we would have ruined our dogs name on it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This item is of poor quality and is so much smallest than depicted on the site. On top of that you have to pay to return the item.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip. Never got a chance to actually wear them but hoping to replace the post with a plastic rod, if I can find the right size.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...?? I'm disappointed in the price for the quality that was received, as I do not believe it is real silver .....

Seller did not communicate or contact me that my order could not be made even though I did not go over the letter count.  The seller should just ask for a name and age and not give false hope with false customization claims. These also appear glossy online but are just black and yellow ink on a dull matte finish.

During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Picture implies that the print is a cut out but when I received the item it was printed on a piece of paper. Not worth the money.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to love this, so dainty & easy to shape but I cannot wear it a day without it irritating my nose. I’ve never had issues with this piercing, but every time I’ve put it in the next morning I have to take it out as my nose gets red and swollen/painful. Similarly priced jewelry has never done this.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Nothing like the photo, and although I understand that stones come in natural variations the one I was sent isn't attractive at all, mostly solid white and nothing I want to wear or create jewelry with.  Not worth $1.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: You get what you pay for! Lesson I need to learn
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was very excited to get it, it looked ok, but was not staying put and broke within minutes.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Awaiting an answer on how we can fix it need it for my wedding in 4 days 😭will update<br /><br />Update no one ever reached out!<br /><br />Order in advance advance it’s not solid wood so it’s very fragile especially depending on your font and name!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Smaller than expected for a large, will fit on a side window not big enough for the back window, ill fitting.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: It came cracked nearly in half in one spot. So not impressed
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I waited for this necklace for 3 weeks. While unwrapping it, I noticed several pieces. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and some how was still shattered. I spent an hour with a bottle of super glue trying to put it back together, as it was a gift. It could have been beautiful, but even with all the work putting it back together it looked awful. I would not recommend this product.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The quality was poor. Utensils were stained & the personalization was faded on the majority of them.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very well made but because of size very difficult to install always bubbles
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is cute but the black lettering faded after two days of wearing it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Didn’t have post to wear it’s like a cuff
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I Didn't realize when I chose a thread color that it would all be that color. I chose navy and even the flowers were in navy. I figured the flowers would stay pink (like in the listing picture). Also, the flowers in the picture are different (and are way better looking) than the flowers on the one I received. I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Should have included paints.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For the price I paid I was expecting a Sterling silver chain. Was not very disappointing. Giftable but who wants a necklace that is going to change color because it’s fake silver. Not me. Pretty but upgrade to Sterling and I’m sure you’ll have a much greater turn around. Aloha!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I was so disappointed when I received these ear rings that I bought for my daughter for Christmas.  They are so over priced and look so cheap like they came from a dollar store.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The sign was gifted and hung outside on August 18 and today is Sept. 17 and the sign is ready for the garbage can after just 30 days.  Seller cannot be reached, so it looks to me he knows about his dishonest way of advertising the sign as being ok for outside with wording 'pool sign' and 'lake sign'.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Wires are very thin and bend easily.  They also work their way out of my ear, and I have almost lost them a couple of times.  Not my favorite earrings due to the poor quality.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Both frames were loosely put together.  One side on both frames were not flush put together.  There was a visible gap in the wood.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: VERY disappointed!  I received my case in the mail on Friday and my name has already rubbed off!  I’ve only had it for 4 days!!!!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: So yes, they are cheap in price but you get what you juyst for.

However, they are both gone now too.<br /><br />Very cute charms but all three are lost now.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: On trash can and they didn’t stick
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: They are cute run small and if u need them for a certain date you better order a month ahead of time. Took over  4 weeks to arrive.. Ridiculous
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: a lot smaller than expected. you pretty much get a print out on some glossy paper. i could’ve did that myself. ultimately i understand it’s my fault that i didn’t read description close enough.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: don't bother buying this product, I received 5 small stone the size of your pinky finger nail nothing like what is says.sooooo disappointing .
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Great words but not worth the money at all!! I'd rather do these and have them laminated myself at a cheaper cost.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: All good
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Too thin. Not worth the price.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Really small.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Dislike
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Wore for one week and initial cams off of bracelet. Cheaply made.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I would have loved this product if it did not smell exactly like vomit. I can't describe it any other way, there is some vanilla scent to it, but mostly a strong smell of bile.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Only 1 of 4 that I ordered had the copper coil.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap Frames and 2 of the pictures were blurry. Not worth anywhere near $50. It was also an opened box and there was a return slip in there from July 2022 (5 months ago) from the last person that purchased it.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Really expected it to be better quality.  Very disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I really liked these earrings but I only wore them a few times since July, and one broke already.  The return window has closed and there's no way to have it fix, so it was a waste.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Too small
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: There are multiple flaws in the craftsmanship . Black marks that were very noticeable in multiple areas. There were multiple splinters in the crevices as well. Wood is thin . Seller agreed to a return with a “ restocking fee”. This was a gift that I am unable to give. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This asked me to provide specifications. I did. They weren't followed. You'll also need pliers.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Her facial expression is not... I mean... it looks like she her stomach hurts and she needs to excuse herself to use the restroom in the middle of a sensitive conversation.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: So, it broke on one side out of the box. Husband still loved it and wouldn't take it off. Less than 3 months later it completely broke.  Looked great, engraved beautifully. Just can't hold up to constant wear.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Arrived late and damaged
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was very disappointed to see this wasn't a plaque or anything,  just a print out on photo paper which I could've done myself.  However,  I didn't pay enough attention to the details because I was eager to order it to complete my bathroom decor.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The printing is so faint that after two months it is unreadable.  Save your money.  It will be of no use if your pet is lost.  The people who find it won't be able to read the tag to contact you.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Smell was good but didn’t last long at all.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s ok , I kept it but it does not look like it’s worth the price I paid, does not look or feel like silver. I would not recommend it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Picture is blurry. It's not very high quality up close.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Although the print is pretty, the &#34;placemat&#34; seems to be just two pieces cut from a tablecloth and sewn together back-to-back.  Plus, I assumed the order would include four placemats, but I only received one.  I submitted a request for returning it to Amazon, and received a reply that they would contact the vendor.  That was several days ago, so I am definitely not satisfied.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the "clasp" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Didn’t love it, nor the words that were chosen for the background. Wasn’t appropriate to hang in my basement where kids play. Threw it out.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Was unable to see an example for the letter I wanted, which was an O, it was pretty hard to tell what it really was.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another. It was very uneven. I was looking for navy blue and light blue which was shown in the picture and it came out as dark blue and purple which made it look a little girly for a boy’s room. The product was expensive plus shipping was not just worth my money.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The name plate area was much smaller than the original photo displayed.  I couldn't even easily read the name without a magnifying glass.<br />This is a result of not being able to actually see the product before purchasing.  I wouldn't have purchased this product.

And like me, you will realize this thing is basically a few simple cuts of plywood that have been stained and assembled using the cheapest legs you can purchase from your local hardware store.  Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It came damaged. Not exactly as pictured either. Which wasn’t a huge issue. But it being damaged is not acceptable. There was no hole in the box it was shipped in, so it had to be done before they packaged it to ship out. See indention and hole in poster in photos.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This shirt is super soft but the color is horrible and the fit is strange- the neck is very high cut, circling the base of the neck rather than around the bottom like a typical round neck tee. The color is mustard yellow- a bright orange/yellow that is displeasing to the eye. I read the other reviews before purchasing and knew it would be bright- but not the mustard tone. I’m really disappointed and don’t plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. I ordered Belle Mickey ears to match and the colors are nothing alike.

The fonts are available online and it would have looked sharp properly printed.

I am very disappointed that this has happened so soon after very minimal wear.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!!

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: This thing has this weird inner rubber gasket. It's so incredibly tight, that when you try to squeeze and jam the airpods in, the inner seal thing snags due to friction and drags it with it. Oh, and it's SO TIGHT you have to cut it off; it will not come out at all.<br /><br />Pretty convenient to say you can't do returns on personalized products when they don't fit and are crap. Easy way to scam and get rid of poorly made merchandise.

I bought these during the COVID lockdown but will wait until stores re-open to purchase personal items such as earrings. Expensive lesson learned.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The print is cute. I ordered these for my identical twin boys that will be turning 2 soon. Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is absolutely NOT what is pictured.  What is pictured looks to be all metal with the shimmering disc in the middle, but it's not.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So disappointed that this towel was made out of microfiber or at least feels like it. I hate the feeling on my hands. Someone else pointed out that it is also printed on one half of the towel so that you have to fold the towel in half to display.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Was pretty disappointed with the quality. The gold lettering was already rubbed off on part of the keychain when I received it. Does not look very nice at all but the keychain itself seems to be okay quality. Was hoping to give this as a gift but it just looks like it’s already been used due to the wear.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointing!

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Not secure and comes off easily, and doesn’t cover all of my hair anyways, it is smaller than my other turban wrap. I bought this for sleep so it will not work. Complete waste of $40. Glad its biodegradable because I am throwing it away.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m not sure if I just got too big of a size because the rest of the reviews are so good. But this thing is sharp. The two points of it dug into my skin inside and out. Every time I tried to blow my nose tissues ripped on it and got stuck.<br />I was afraid to size down too far because of getting it in, and I’m glad I didn’t cause it did take a little pressure to get it in, and it kinda hurt lol.<br />I’m returning it, it was nice quality as far as I could tell but i must be the only person who doesn’t wanna be stabbed every time there’s anything touching my nose 😂<br />Def don’t buy if you’re a sneezy person, ouchie.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: It arrived horribly bent. Even though the cost was so low, I assumed it would be more substantial than it was in terms of the paper and the the foil, but oh well. Not really worth the $10 for it to arrive like this.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Easy to put on and take off! Save tearing up your pant pockets and belts!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: BEWARE: this is NOT the correct nose piercing gauge. 24 gauge is way too thin; standard is 20 gauge. Thin jewelry, especially when curved, can cause the "cheese cutter" effect. I'll admit though, I LOVED the way it looked on my nose initially.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Disappointed -I should have read the reviews- It's printed on the equivalent of photography paper.  The design is very cute, I thought it would have been printed on masonite or some other stand alone material. Needs to be framed.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I asked my son and mother what it said before telling them and they couldn’t even make out my name! It is a bunch of squiggles. Nothing more. I can’t believe I wasted my money on this!!!! It is going to cost more to return it than what I paid for it. Scammed again!!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This was fine for a party decoration, even though it was printed slightly crooked. Absolutely not gift worthy. I ordered it as a gift; would not recommend for that purpose. Couldn’t return so I had to throw it away.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Glad I have different backs for earrings because these had no hole in one and the other was too small to get the earring through.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have other line art that is awesome. This picture is NOT. It looks so amateurish like it was drawn with a thick magic marker. So I returned it and bought the "pinky swear" art piece from another source. So happy with the new one.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Love the look of this and while it does seem easy to install, it didn’t work out very well. The “L” didn’t stick down to the morrow well so when pulling up the backing it shifted. It now looks like a lower case “b”
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: These address stickers were stuck to the backing to the point that they wouldn’t come loose and adhere to the metal mailbox.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not only is quality very poor but the plastic posts bend easily and are difficult to get into ear.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I've always wanted a world map with pins. This one is beautiful, but there are some things I'd caution buyers about.  Some of the pieces are not very well made. For instance, once I'd put the pin in the UK piece, it broke :(  Next, it's not very easy to assemble, especially on the floor. And once you put it on the wall, forget about trying to get it off again to make any adjustments...the pieces will break if you try to remove them from the wall. Also, double check your flags....some flags were wrong on mine (such as Peru) and some flags were in the wrong place (for me, the Saudi Arabia flag was in the place of Russia's flag). Google ALL flags before pinning them on your wall if you aren't 100% confident that you know the country's flag. I won't be returning mine because, as I said, it's difficult to remove it from the wall and I paid a lot of money for it...easier to just leave it as it is at this point.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: the product is so small! it is better that have a photo to compere the size with something. now that I want to return the shipping is more than half the price of the item! this is ridiculous!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Love the shirt but was a tad too small. Epic Design refused to let me return for a bigger size. So if you order from this company order a size up or your screwed.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Certainly not worth the money, but I didn't have time to send it back...so I kept it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Highly disappointed. Its like someone cut out a piece of a newpaper and drew a giraffe on it. I could get the same thing at the dollar tree WITH a frame for a buck. Dont buy
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Thought this would be bigger and better quality
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too small names barely legible
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This was very disappointing. Wasn’t made well and not good product material
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: The item i ordered looks different than the one i got ... see pictures<br /><br />1st picture has a nice elegant clip<br />2nd picture has my hand ...only comes with a button ...<br /><br />Disappointed customer.  If you're able to send me the one on the 1st picture, that would make me really REALLY HAPPY
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Received the item…. The print was cut crooked and it was just a standard printer paper…. The paper also had a stain on the bottom. Definitely wouldn’t order.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This tee is sooo long. Unfortunately I didn't know that I cannot return or exchange. Not impressed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Too small
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Wished I had looked closer
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It is pretty and the photos are true to the way that it appears but it is not sturdy at all for it to fall apart from the chord.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: not as expected
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Looks great.  But it turned my husband finger green on day one. I do not recommend getting it. A ring at this price should not do that. Made me very very sad.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Great quality and amazing design however the measurements were 8x10 instead of 11x14
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This was very underwhelming. I was planning on buying a ton of these and am very glad I didn't. My fiancee`s last name was left off even though I requested it. Where some of the words are wood burned in they are not clear and difficult to read and the magnent on the back looks like it was just thrown on there (not in a good place to keep this on my fridge). This falls off of my fridge daily and i am very glad I did not buy these for my guests. Shipping also took over a month.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not for LT wear.<br />This discolored & did not have luster it once did after 2 weeks of daily use. Sad.  Very nice on arrival !
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I never received this. Too bad. Kind of expensive.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Broke within a week of getting it
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very cheap, not worth the money and it's plastic!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I was so excited for this product and knew as soon as it was delivered that I had made a huge mistake, not worth the price and the smallest of my stones was under 15mm. I have tiny hands so this reference picture doesn’t even properly demonstrate just how small these are. Unfortunately they’re gorgeous and I just can’t let them go, but if I do regret buying them

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Very small and light metal.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Que la piedra se nota falsa
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very pretty but didn't last. Normal wear, didn't catch on anything.  Just fell apart when my daughter picked up to put it on.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very disappointed! I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly. The seller insisted I bought the wrong case for my model phone... I did not. The case is not made properly. The only option I was given was to replace the case with the same case. No thanks.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: great
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not sure if you’re able to do this but you need a gender option because in the photos it’s fairly flat mine is just feminine. If it’s hand made it should be easy to make it like the picture. Don’t get me wrong it’s nice and fit right but smh. What a disappointment that was. All that waiting time and money for me to flatten it out myself or pay more for someone else to do it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Definitely not worth the money. Go get it at walmart for the same price but bigger
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I am disappointed in the size of the Ulu. It is for a man with larger hands and I don’t see how this will work.  For $129 I thought it looked much larger. Not sure since it’s a gift, what to do.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Definitely not what I expected. Has absolutely no lather to it at all. Smell is good. Seems to be too oil based. Would not purchase again! I have started ordering a homemade whip from a local vendor, 14oz for $14. Also offer an assortment of different scents and goes a long way!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty necklace but the chain broke on the first day at the area where the chain hooked up with the stones
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The design was nicely done but no way was this shirt an XXL.  I wear a medium and the shirt  JUST fit me. Very disappointed. There was no size tag on the shirt anywhere so I am not even sure it is an XXL.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It was stiff and uncomfortable to wear!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Way, way to small and way to lightweight! Not worth the money. Cheaply made.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I wanted to love these.....So cheap looking!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It's thicker than I would like for it to be. Make sure you have a roomy wallet to fit it in. Don’t recommend.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: So disappointed. The writing is MUCH lighter than on picture. The charm on the bracelet I purchased from my daughter in law fell off on day 2. I felt terrible.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not a great product.  Doesn’t match the site description
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Much too small!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not what was advertised. Disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very pretty but the backings that came with the earrings didn’t fit. One of them fell out of my ear during the day never to be seen again. Also when tou put them on notice that they can’t go in the same direction unless you put them in only one ear.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I like it, the saying is beautiful, but this is NOT engraved, the print is raised and after a couple of weeks the lettering is already fading.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Without a doubt this is not pure titanium. This should feel as light as aluminum. Feels like and looks like stainless steel.  Rip-off at this price. Should be priced at about $20 - $25.  I will return for money back.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This product was 8x11 photo paper. No frame just photo printed.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: much bigger and thicker than described.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cute when first on. Tried several ways to make it stay in place. Every time the watch would be moving around and the rest of the band very tight.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I already send it back to the address they gave me wrong spelling the parents was not happy to thin I mail it out 7/21/22
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The pictures I received were clearly over-processed.  Areas that should demonstrate dimensional texturing were nearly blacked out.  Disappointed!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is absolutely not what is pictured. It came in a horrible box, crushed. The sweet message was not in there. This is a horrible lie, you don’t get what it says you do. It looks cheap.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Definitely getting my money back!!! This is nowhere near the amount that was in the description. Smh. I brought this to fill my bridesmaids boxes. It was barely enough to fill to boxes.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cute, but didn’t last for a second wear. Overpriced
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Started peeling off
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These as not as advertised. I bought one and it was not the color I wanted or was advertised. We contacted the seller who to get another shirt and they were hard to deal with. But they finally shipped us another shirt. The second shirt that was shipped to us and it was still the wrong color. The fit was as expected just not the right colors.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Ring looks nothing like pictures. Stone sits a good 2 cm above band which makes it look like something out of a gumball machine. I requested a return and it was accepted, but when I went to send it back it was going to cost me $60 in shipping. Rediculous. Really wish I had read the reviews. Buy at your own risk- it costs more than the ring to send it back!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: If you have an extra large head these would be perfect.  They are nice material. I was having trouble finding a nask to fit,y husband. These cover his face from his Adam’s Apple to the lower eyelid.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: This item is SMALL nothing like advertised. The item was listed for $20 after everything it cost $89 for NOTHING. Do not waste your money or time. It took several weeks to arrive to say I am disappointed is a high understatement. I will be returning this garbage today!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Cute little nose stud (although expensive I’ll admit). Had it in for 2 days…fell out twice, second time sadly I was showering & down the drain it went.<br />The design isn’t coiled inside so it comes out very easily.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: To SMALL!!!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Necklace arrived made incorrectly. Will not order again.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Extremely overpriced for the size. I gave it 2 stars simply because it is cute and Mickey Mouse. Otherwise, I would have given it a 1. The greenery is plastic, not realistic looking at all. There were hot glue strands all over the ears that I had to remove. It claims to be 10”, but from the top of the ear to the bottom of the wreath, it is 7”. From ear to ear across, it is only 9”. I feel like I was completely ripped off.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I felt in love with this necklace, but the pendant began to turn a color like copper and had to through it away;  I really liked it.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I've bought a necklace from this company before and loved it so I thought I would buy another one and was sadly disappointed. The beads are small and very lightweight. I was expecting something with more substance than what I received.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I ordered the 5 pack set and wasn’t really impressed.  The price was reasonable. The Oder was great the first day then quickly disappeared. One to two days tops is all you can expect with this product an then you will need to change out the wax.  I’ve used others that lasted longer.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Great design but was surprised when I received them that they were just printed on a slightly higher gauge of paper than what you use in your printer day today.  Would suggest a more sunstantial/stiffer material to resemble more what is placed on the doors at hotels.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Just paper - not framed  have to read description of this product it has no frame
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: I am very disappointed.  This was going to be a gift, now not so sure.  I had this engraved  but this is so small  you need reading glasses to see inscription.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It doesn’t fit in my car holder, it’s hard to hold to take a call. What’s really crummy is I paid for shipping to receive it, AND $7 to return it! Shame on you! It weighs less than 8oz!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Sent seller a message there was a typo, she acknowledged it, thanked me but didn’t offer to replace mine! Wow! Great she will fix for future people, but not the one who brought it to her attention!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It is not as pictured. The headband I received says Happy Hanukkah all over it. Nowhere near as cute as the one pictured. Also, just FYI the under part of the headband is a weak thin strap. Actually looks more like a sleeping mask than a headband. LOVE the idea and last year I bought my sister in law one which she loves but the one received today is far different and disappointing

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: If this ring is sterling silver why will your finger turn green? I’m waiting for two that Ive purchased and I don’t want this if my finger will turn green. False advertising to say it’s sterling silver. I have many sterling rings and my finger has never turned green.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I bought these earrings because they state that they are sterling sliver. I have a metal allergy and can only wear pure gold or 925 sterling silver. Within 90 seconds of putting the earrings on my ears started itching. Beautiful earrings, but I can't wear them.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Im pretty dissapointed in this product. Not as the product description descrined. The small stones in the head of the stem are literally plastic beads. Tou can actually see the thread holes through the sides. The weight is terribly out of proportion. I wouldnt habe bought this if i had known what low quality this was going to be. Am definitely going to try and send back for a refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I got my wife one for Christmas. Within a few weeks the paper was peeling off of the board. I contacted the company and they were nice and sent another one.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Elastic made , easily broken but nice and simple
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The description now says not a tin sign, but this item is clearly SEO'd to come up when you search tin signs because that's how I found it. My bad. Not worth $12 for a piece of paper.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The print of dog paws with names is absolutely the best idea, so sweet. The tshirt quality is terrible, thin, and cheap. If the shirt material was quality it would be a perfect 10. I'm afraid to wash it because I am sure it will shrink and fall apart.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: It’s not what I expected, it’s too small to give us a gift unless it’s for an infant. The quality is great but everything else is not worth the money and it’s ridiculously small to be considered a gift.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice but be aware that if you order from this company and you want to return something-its a 20% restocking fee and the customer pays for the return back. IMO not worth it. Product is just OK. Not really great.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Watch out, being deceived. They use a dark background on this picture so when you actually see them they are a very expensive clear beer glass.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: This product asked for 6 extra dollars to arrive a blue gift box, and instead it came in a trashy looking bland cardboard box. I have better and cuter gift boxes lying around my house I could've used, so that was a major let down.<br />And the chain came knotted and I couldn't unknot it! I tried gifting this to my mother but even she couldn't get it loose.<br />Also some of the engraved letters have a bit of a smudge.<br />Please, please, please save your money and look elsewhere.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: No way is this worth almost $20. The tune is off, the quality is.. junk-ey. It has to be hand cranked continuously to keep playing (CAN NOT BE WOUND). I honestly wish I would have just bought the brown one for 1/2 the price
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love it it looks great. I get tons of compliments. However I hav only had it a month and it is tarnishing. The underside of it looks terrible. Very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This is the most irritating purchase I think I’ve made, the pieces have no structure to them they’re super fragile, the finished image above is nowhere near what you are purchasing (seller needs to remove that image), half the prints don’t line up with the small rod assembly holes, they’re no instructions whatsoever, and you have to provide your own assembly rods, the butt stock is literally 2 different sizes, this seller needs to seriously address the quality of their products and redesign most of them, this isn’t the only item I’ve been severely disappointed with from them, you’re much better off going to an Etsy shop and spending a bit more money, it will be a much better investment.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The scent is super strong and very overpowering its the only thing I could smell in the house and everyone in the home complained about how strong it was.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I love this necklace. I love everything about this necklace except for the letters "machine engraved". In the pictures on the site you can clearly see what ever is written on it but when I received mine today I needed a magnifying glass to read it. I had an 8 letter name engraved. I thought I was ripped off at first and nothing was printed on it. That's how little the letters are. I opted for the machine stamped instead because I've ordered items like this in the past and had no issues being able to read it. I ordered this for valentines day and needless to say, I'm very disappointed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I was super excited to get a custom shirt.  Super soft!  But didn’t even get through one day of wearing and the material started to peel/fray.  The letters look great.  But I feel maybe I should just frame it and make it a decoration near my workout area instead.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Item is smaller than shown in the picture. It broke after a few days of my daughter wearing it. It was a complete waste of money.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The shirt and graphic quality are good, but beware that you don’t get to choose the color of the balloon dog. I thought it would be some solid color like all the examples but I ended up with a solid white one that I would never have chosen. I can’t return this so I’m going to try to color the balloon somehow.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice color, but did not come on a wooden spool as pictured.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: I was denied a return on this bracelet. Reason given…”Resized or altered jewelry cannot be returned.” I assume the symbol I selected to be embossed on underside of bracelet is considered an alteration. However, you have to choose a symbol or word to have embossed before you can place the order. Do not order if you think there is any reason you may want to return it!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This bracelet was so delicate and beautiful although not very durable but I wasn’t looking for that. But when I opened the box it was a very small child size. I have small wrists but this literally fit on two fingers. I have it to my 3 year old Granddaughter and it fit her perfectly.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: The color is much darker than the pic.  It looks black on my nails.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: This product is not the quality of a similar product that I have purchased elsewhere in the past.  The glitter is only on one side of the words.  The vinyl is very thin and floppy.  The wooden skewers that are glued to the vinyl of course get cake icing on them making you wonder if it is safe to use again.  This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: MAKE SURE YOU READ DESCRIPTION. The order DOES NOT match the pictures of the product so don’t base yourself off of that. This product is NOT FRAMED. You literally get PAPER PICTURES. Paid 45$ for PAPER PICTURES. DO NOT ORDER. Not to mention they don’t accept returns because they are “customs” yet you don’t have a choice to choose out of different pictures so I don’t see what’s custom about it. Hilarious. I hope you go out of business since you like to just rip people off. :) PS you should think about putting a realistic picture of the product... oh wait you can’t cause no one in their right mind would buy. Lesson learned

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I’m hoping it holds up. It seems cheaply made for the price. I hope it is natural amethyst but honestly it doesn’t look it. It is large for a woman’s wrist, even on the tightest clasp it is very loose. Packaging was very cheap as you can see. So if you intend it for a gift, plan on buying a separate box to give it in.

I wouldn't recommend these.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Very small. Mama Bear is barely visible and chain is flimsy. Not sterling!! Plated with what "they" call Sterling.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Totally not worth the money. My daughter bought me some really cool carved letter tiles for less money. When I requested a return they denied it as my item was “personalized”. Silly me, I thought they could re-sell the letters. Feel ripped off.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I originally bought two. One broke because it’s extremely fragile. Order another one & that arrived in pieces. Packaging that it was shipped in was a shipping envelope and the sign was wrapped in one layer of thin bubble wrap. This should have been shipped in a box, given how easily they break.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: This name tag is so rigid, it is completely inflexible, making it basically impossible to place on a stethoscope as advertised. By removing an ear bud, I could slide the name tag only through the metal section of my steth - it stops at the tubing and won’t go any further. This is the least effective way to tag a stethoscope - as soon as someone removes an ear bud, it will take &lt;1 second to slide out this name tag. Not worth it.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Scam. Absolute scam. There’s a reason it’s ranked 17,800. Don’t buy. “Hand Made.” Wrapped a wire around a tube, cut a bunch of them off, put them in a box. You’ll look like a 12 year old. Unless you are a 12 year old you need to stop spending your moms money.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with "Our Anniversary"  [our names] and  [date]  with  "25 years  and Counting".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  "Magnetic" pages is just a new name for old school "press & stick" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: This was A fine slime, but it could use some help. It could not come out of the container, but it was not sticky! It also left a strange residue on my hand. So I re-activated it and it still had the same texture! I could have spent my money on something else!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These are beautiful. The sterling silver that I got is flexible but they hold their shape.

When I tried taking a cube out, the package cracked again. The directions instruct to keep in air tight packaging.... that’s pretty much impossible with the package it was sent in. I got very little essential oil /menthol smell. Seems like the product and container are old. I do not recommend.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It fits the light panel spot fine, but it has very poor quality printing for the design. A small scratch will take the printing right off, and the printing is grainy.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: They were way smaller than I was expecting 😅 to me they are more like small children earrings. I guess I didn’t read the size.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: La verdad. No me gustó!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The necklace is cute but I don't recommend because it pulls hair terribly. It's the type of chain the wraps up in your hair and janks it out. If there was a different chain this would be 5 stars.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Fades fast. The metal is cheap. Color fades off.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice charm in shape and size but looks really cheap. The “gold” is extremely yellow and fake looking. The chain and charm are the same fake gold color. Came without anything saying the material actually used. Disappointing. Wanting to return it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: There's a similar appearing item on etsy that is much more substantial for only $5 more, a very high quality and structured bag. This bag is a very thin and flimsy very basic canvas tote with a zipper top and the pocket organizer is tiny compared to the bag so its more like another random item tossed in than anything helpful. The embroidery is nice though, unfortunately however that makes it unreturnable.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I really do not like writing bad reviews, but these earrings were not it for me. They irritated my ears badly (but I do have very sensitive skin) and I cannot wear them anymore. I am not sure if I put them in wrong and closed them wrong when they were in my ears but the little opening always got stuck inside my ear. I was very hopeful but they did not work out for me. I would say that if you have sensitive ears, do not buy these.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: I bought my Silver Metal Band in June 30, 2017. I was so excited when I reveived it. I got so much complements on it, it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. After wearing it for just a few months the charm discolored, that was a big disappointment. I changed the band. When I went back to use the Silver Metal Band the latch didn't snap back on. Its no good. I couldn't believe it. I probably use it for about 5 months, once I removed it that was it. I haven't been able to use it :/

Not even a nice matte paper or cardstock. The imagine is just ok.. it almost look like it got distorted from the imagine being blown up too large. It’s not pixelated, just… fuzzy? I don’t know it’s just ok. It’s for a guest half bath for laugh value so I’m keeping it but I won’t order more prints from here.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The picture says it all. There was no place for me to give them directions that I did not want their tool icons or images on my sign. So I took a chance thinking that somebody would have the forethought not to put the tools on a no diving sign. I would return the damn thing but I needed it for insurance purposes. Somebody needs to pull their head out of their bottom and think about their customers needs! Who in the hell would want wrenches and screwdrivers on a simple sign that says no diving shallow.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I received one bar of soap when the picture depicted 3. It should have been clearer if there is only one bar for the price point. The soap itself looked strange. I've bought handmade soap before and I guess I was expecting something similar. I sent it back because I wouldn't pay $6 for one bar of soap (especially when I was expecting 3).
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Love the print, had to have it. Wish I saved my cash. The t-shirt itself is super thin and shrunk alot. I wouldn't even care if it was a 10 dollar fair t-shirt, but at 27 bucks I expect a little bit more.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I have had these earrings in my wishlist for over a year and finally decided to buy them for myself, so I was beyond disappointed when I received them. I opened them and instantly noticed that they are completely tarnished! I ordered silver on silver, but as you can see from the picture they are not silver! I was also disappointed by the look of them, they are much larger than I was expecting and they look cheaply made. I will be returning for a refund because even if they weren’t tarnished I am not happy with them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: When I first reviewed this ring I gave it 5 stars and said it was exactly what I wanted.  Well I have changed my mind.  When I first recieved this ring it was a beautiful shiny gold. I wore it for an hour then put it back in the box it came in.  A few days later when I go to wear the ring, to my surprise it is now a tarnished almost copper gold.  Very dissapointed.  Bought a similar ring from different seller and same thing happened.  No more gold filled rings for me.

Additionally, the flower design is a pretty thin cut-out just tacked onto the top of a cylinder band which is not the craftsmanship I was hoping for.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I had high hopes for this necklace and was very underwhelmed at the size of the chain and the ball beads.<br />I had trouble putting on and taking off the necklace by myself and I think that whenever I wear it, it will really not be noticed or add anything to my overall look.  The chain is so small I could not even get a focused photo of it. The closest I could do was when it was still in its little bag (the bag is 1 1/2" x 2 1/2"). Each bead is about 1/16" width.<br />Although it is in a "velvet pouch" (see photo 5 with the "G" the company name partly missing), the necklace was not "ready to give". It was in a small plastic bag and that bag was sealed inside aslightly larger plastic film. If you were going to present this as a gift, you need to do some rewrapping to prevent it from looking so cheap.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: The gold part is pretty thick, and the &#34;marble&#34; is quite thin- just wasnt the look I was going for. Seemed flimsy, but not too awful for the price. I returned.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: First one the metal loop that the lace goes through was crooked and it would hang at an angle. Looked odd. Tried to bend it back and it snapped like cheap plastic. Sent it back and got another one. Straight this time but the metal loop was slightly off center. Looked much better hanging though so I was happy with it until the screw that goes into the pendant just came out on its own. Probably could fix it with super glue but at this point I don't even care. Save your money and buy from a different manufacturer.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Was so excited to finally go from a stud to a hoop. I ordered a size too small the first time, so I ordered a bigger size and it fit perfectly! I noticed right away it was kind of uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to it being something new and irritation from changing to a hoop. Well 9 hours later my nose is forming a bump where the hole is and it's even more irritating, itching and starting to get uncomfortable. I sadly have to take it out before it gets too bad! I guess it will be a stud for now. I never had an issue with nose bones, which is what i like to use. This is the first time I had an issue with jewelry. Just something to think about if you're on the fence about ordering one of these.

Was so excited to find some pumpkin scents &#34;our of season!&#34;<br /><br />Nope, scent, fully melted can't be enjoyed it's so weak in the room with the burner. Sigh.....burnt one from one of three packs, two days ago and even hubby and his sensitive nose couldn't detect it unless quite close to the burner, so skipped a day and just wiped another out of the burner, this time the Pumpkin cupcake.<br /><br />Is it the soy that somehow makes these things weaker than non-soy?? because I bought soy squares from two different companies in this one order and it's weak, too!!<br /><br />Help me and yes, some of you I hope will still try this label and give them a chance, just in case......I right now have another, known and reliable brand in my burner, so when it's totally melted awhile I am going to walk into the garage and back into the house to see if it's *my nose* or for sure, this product.<br /><br />I am honest and sincere. I do not own wax company or know anyone that does. I'm hooked on the stuff. Heck yeah, there's something cool about aromatherapy but I am surprised to even be able to say this.<br /><br />To the owners, are you maybe not using enough oil? Not buying a strong enough oil product? Then if not, help me understand, how is it that Walmart's &#34;ScentSationals&#34; brand is, not all scents for any one nose, but a lot of theirs are strong! so strong that I can smell it out of the room it burns in and across a large livingroom, the other side of it?<br />Yesterday, I took a break from these two new brands and burnt &#34;Warm Apple Pie&#34; by walmart and dang!! it was barely melted and we both were smelling it 20 feet and more, from the burner, then as expected it filled the two rooms, honestly and it is not soy.<br /><br />So, is it possibly that we are not meant to be fans of *any brand* of SOY? if so....folks reading this, please give this brand more chances,<br />God bless the owners cuz dang, am surprised and not happy about this.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: UPDATE: Unfortunately, the bracelet broke over the weekend of 02/24/2023 the rattail cording snapped, and my teen lost 5 of the 6 beads that were released when the bracelet broke. Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.

(Well...as much as anyone can "love" a mask, lol!)<br />The rooster applique is beautiful.<br />However, I also want a mask to be somewhat, well, *practical.*  The fit is horrible.  It gapes.  Just pulling it more against the face does not fix the fitting problem.  I am so bummed.  It is the worst fitting mask I've every tried.  The package says on it that once open, it cannot be returned for sanitary reasons.  I understand...but there was no way I was going to know how it fit until *after* I opened the package.  As it is, perhaps I'll purchase another black mask from a maker that I have already seen makes a well-fitting mask, and move the rooster applique to that mask.  :(
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This little necklace is so cute it’s almost exactly what I wanted. But after just one where it’s tarnished. And also it moves around a lot so you’re constantly adjusting it. I was disappointed
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Protic came creased because the shipping container was not rigid enough. The glossy finish on the print makes it difficult to hang in certain spaces because there’s too much reflection. Returning these since they are damaged

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Most uncomfortable noise ring I've ever worn in my life. Says it is Sterling silver, maybe plated, but is definitely nickel or some other cheap metal. It tarnished and caused severe irritation to my piercing (redness, tenderness, and swelling) and NO my piercing is not new, it was done over a decade ago. For around the same price, sometimes less, you can get a 4pk of nose rings from Ruffian that are WAY BETTER, in my opinion, they've never caused me any issues and I've used them for almost 3 years now. It makes me genuinely sad, this was so cute and I had such high hopes. Don't get me wrong, IT IS SUPER CUTE, I was in love with it when I first put it in, but after barely a day my nose was soooo sore and when I took out the nose ring to look at my piercing the ring was black, washed my piercing immediately and put in a hoop from my Ruffian pack and was fine in a couple days, haven't had a problem since.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I love the sticker but I don't like that it was shown as black and it's written in the fine print that it's actually white.  No use for a white sticker on a white car.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I wish I had known before purchasing that this was going to be sheer/see through. Tried wearing a tank top under it, a white bra, everything and it just didn't look like. Even with pasties on, those show through.<br /><br />I wanted to support small business and they left a cute note with the shirt but I was still highly disappointed. Just be aware that its completly sheer and see through before purchasing.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I didn’t realize how tiny this would be. The picture makes it look so big, and honestly it was the size of my finger nail. And the embossed leave with your initial is so faint it is sort of pointless. I also don’t believe it is genuine turquoise, which is the stone I ordered. It sounds like plastic resin when you tap on it. I also spent more money upgrading to the sterling silver chain, and sterling silver always has to be indicated with the 925 label. The chain doesn’t look like sterling silver at all. I pretty much feel like I got ripped off. I ended up going to a different store and buying a legitimate turquoise necklace.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Locket is way too small for pictures or any momentum. Both chain and rope chain broke very easily. The heart itself was pretty and unique, but not made for any pictures. Not worth the 80 something dollars I paid for it. Wanted it to place some hair of my dead husband into.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived in a thin shipping cardboardish shipping envelope stuffed in a plastic shipping bag. Results, photo with several creases and bends in it. To think it took more than a week to rcv a damaged poorly printed, photo. Id been far better off printing this out from my home printer working from a screenshot of the product. Couldn't be more disappointed in the overall quality and lack of care that was took when packaging for shipment. Had this been put inside a cardboard box with bubble wrap and the box arrived beat up and damaged, I would understand that it was likely the shipping company that done this, however this was clearly a lack of care by the seller because of the manner in which it left their possession in the first place. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I initially loved this product! It was high gloss, had super rich colors, a deep black background, and sturdy weight. By the six week mark, the colors drastically started to fade. The rich black background turned a peachy color. I contacted the seller. They quickly sent me a replacement. Then.... six more weeks passed and the same thing happened! It is hanging in my office and receives no direct sunlight. I’m highly disappointed. The seller gave me the option of returning the item for a refund. I opted not to due to the cost of return shipping.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not what I expected. When you say plated, you get the impression that it will be on some sort of metal. Ex, brass, nickel, copper... but this is thin plastic.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap material (plastic and aluminum). The lamp at the top of the post is not worth the extra money, it is small and the light is a tiny white light. While it is attractive from afar, certainly not worth the price. Seller forgot to include the lamp hook. Not customer friendly or solution oriented.  Would never recommend to my neighbors.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Nothing about this item is real but the cardboard box, I would doubt the chain is even plated silver, let alone actual silver. The "pearl" isn't even good costume jewelry, and the paint was flaking off when it arrived. They could have used a shell pearl instead of cultured and fooled most people... but nope wanted to cut all costs and used plastic beads. Ridiculous. I can't stand deceptive sellers, stay away!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It is probably my own fault for not understanding this is basically a photo. It looked like a beautiful wood piece in the picture posted here.  That is not what it is. The description says it doesnt come with a frame, "but why would it need one?" Or, that was my thought when I bought it. So yes, I was surprised and disappointed that I payed over $13... for a photo.  We will try to make it work for what we planned but it likely was just $13 I wasted.  I am not returning it, as there was nothing wrong with it.  It just was not what I expected, I purchase.  Seeing as there has not been a review yet,  I felt buyers may want to know what they are getting.

Measure your favorite t shirt that fits the way you want you shirt to fit then compare those measurements to the sellers size chart to get the most accurate measurements expectations.

It doesn't mention anywhere that you have to scratch off the silver sticker to read the message.<br />So if you aren't present when the person opens it to explain what to do- they would have no clue there is something written underneath the silver "planet." It just looks like part of the design. You could write instructions on the back of the card, but who wants to do that if you are sending out a large amount. And you can't write on the front because its dark in color.<br />They need to add a simple "scratch here" or something to the silver sticker or the back of the card- otherwise they are pretty much useless. Disappointing.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Hi, I recently bought 3 sterling silver bracelets from you in July 2022. All 3 identical, 1 for myself and the other two for friends. This for me, just graduating college was a lot to spend. I was so excited when I received them. They were beautiful. But,  as I’ve worn mine daily since 7/29/22, the metal around the gems is red. Your website claimed the item to be sterling silver (925). I’m so disappointed and embarrassed since I gave the other two as gifts and they are in the same shape as mine. What a shamble.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: First the delivery took much longer than expected. It came in a week late, which was frustrating because I went with them because of the estimated delivery dates. Also you should not try to repostion the decals once you put it on the cup, mine came apart and the letter broke. Other than those two things, the decals looked great, loved the lettering and the colors!
