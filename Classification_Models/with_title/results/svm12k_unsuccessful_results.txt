True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Don't waste your $$ or time This is a complete rip off!!!  Don't waste your $$ or time!  It turned within a few days of wearing it!!!!!!!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE, DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!!!!!!!!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Will give you an infection, and will turn green. When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: arrived broken I waited for this necklace for 3 weeks. While unwrapping it, I noticed several pieces. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and some how was still shattered. I spent an hour with a bottle of super glue trying to put it back together, as it was a gift. It could have been beautiful, but even with all the work putting it back together it looked awful. I would not recommend this product.

I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Excellent Idea, Poorly Executed I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.

I moved the magnets away from the ferrofluid and put the bottle on a shelf. The next day all the ferrofluid had hardened into this weird shape. Sad that it cost $30 and didn't last long.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much ... I have to admit that I’m NOT impressed. Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Iaco Iusday This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE! DO NOT BUY! There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Absolutely beautiful!! This is the second ring I've bought from this seller.  I now have both of Claire's wedding bands from the show Outlander and I love them both 💜  They are both very well crafted and worth every penny.<br />UPDATE 02\17\21: I have to remove some stars from this ring, after really looking at it, this was not made by hand (as in NOT well crafted) at all, it must've been stamped by a machine because 2 out of the 3 pineapples aren't fully etched in nor are the others which I believe to be a leaf and feather maybe??  Really hard to tell.  I still wear it but wouldn't pay this much if I had seen it in person.  The other one, while not really looking like Claire's ring, is still very pretty.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cool design, horrible execution, abnormal sizing The design would be so cool if you could actually see it. The black printing is so close to the color of the gray shirt that someone will have to be right up on your chest to see what it is. Also, its either an irregular cut shirt or one of those reject ones you buy from the discount stores because it is way wider and shorter than a typical size large.

Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!

Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste.

Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Other superior items available... These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: This is a piece of paper you are buying, not an album! So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Too expensive to be so cheaply made Looks cool with the lights sitting on the shelf.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Gold foil was fading off before I even took it out of the bag! Was pretty disappointed with the quality.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Neat concept, too greasy for me. I have dry skin and I thought I would love this product. I used lotion and body oils to keep my skin hydrated. This stick applies easily. The scented products are lovely, but I did not like the smell of unscented product. I used this stick lotion after showering and massaged it in, but it didn't absorb and I had a waxy coat on my skin that I didn't like. It just was too heavy and left me feeling greasy.<br /><br />May work for some people, but was too heavy and left a waxy coating that didn't work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Someone definitely wasn’t paying attention when they engraved what I ordered. I’m definitely going to be returning this.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks and feels super cheap, like $10 cheap. I could deal with that because it wasn’t terribly expensive and you get what you pay for. BUT, I had the bracelet personalized and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is UPSIDE DOWN. The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth the price! I’m all about supporting small businesses but the amount you get fit the price was laughable. You could easily cut this amount in 5 mins. I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price. Go to the dollar store, buy tissue and cut your own in a couple of minutes.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Looks like it was traced with a magic marker I have other line art that is awesome. This picture is NOT.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very Disappointing! I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.

As pretty as this is, I wouldn't recommend it.

One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.

I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.
