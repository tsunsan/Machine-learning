True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Picture does not match the earrings The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Already Dying After 3 Weeks I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Just buy the key It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very cheaply made but not for a cheap price I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Two Stars As described but packaging could have been better for the price
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Decent smelling, long time to ship though Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not quite right I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not happy... Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Too Pink Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth it. I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed "sterling silver " which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Great Idea, Terrible execution. So sad. What I got was really awful. It was not hand printed, it was computer generated, and in addition several words were misspelled.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Just a photo not a poster It is just a photo printed. Same thing you could do at Walmart for a few cents. The print is a nice print, but not close to being worth 13 dollars. Maybe $1.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth the price Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I hate the font. It says sweet dreading.  The return amount on this product was $70. It really is I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to… And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.

Nada profesional al menos podia ayudar al cliente aunque hiciera un descuento. NO RECOMIENDO HACERLE COMPRAS A ESTE VENDEDOR. 👎👎👎
