True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Picture does not match the earrings The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth the price Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Breathable but not a good fit The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Backs not secure. I really did love the earrings, unfortunately, I lost one the 2 nd day I wore them. The back had come loose earlier that day, but I felt it. The next time, I didn’t even know until someone said it was missing. So bummed.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Good concept I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip. Never got a chance to actually wear them but hoping to replace the post with a plastic rod, if I can find the right size.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Rip Off. They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing I loved the necklace and it arrived in pretty good timing. However, stating that it's &#34;silver&#34; is a little misleading as it is all tarnished and dull and even turning green  ;( it can't be cleaned or polished back to it's luster ...??

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Tiny circumference. Disappointed Too small for my son who doesn't have a large neck; it was for his birthday. I gave it 2 stars because I really like it, but it's small for a man or a woman. During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Peeling They do not stick fully. They are now peeling from the wall. I guess i cant return because they ate half stuck so ill have to make believe its a 3d effect of the flowers and leafs curling
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Before you buy, Please read the description thoroughly! This is good for those who don't mind the extra work, but I made the mistake of impulse purchasing, without reading and unfortunately I am stuck with a kit I have to file, sand and assemble, which is not something I'm good at and not comfortable doing. Hopefully I won't mess it up. Lesson learned! Just thought I'd share from experience.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Purchase elsewhere Very thin braids, are darkish brown in color and have literally no scent to them. Kinda ratty. I prefer braids to be fragrant, fresh and braided a bit thicker with more than a few strands of grass. These ones are very brittle and fragile. If I were to grasp them in my hand they would probably turn to dust.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Seller Wrote Wrong Date on Shirt I loved the sweatshirt and so did my friend - so comfy and cute. But she gets married in 2022 and the sweatshirt says 2023.

Sad because I was really looking forward to this sweatshirt.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Not terrible So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty but doesn’t stick well Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.

The break in the paper should make them easy peel in theory, but in actuality not the case. Very disappointed that I spent $10 on these stickers. Save your money, or just throw $10 in the trash.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I'm sorry I wasted my money. Completely disappointed. I ordered a 23 in a $85 wall art of a pitbull in a dark Rusty copper. For my son who is in Florida. After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Fell apart first use I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not as high quality as advertised The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Terrible quality and arrived damaged So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Extremely overpriced! Come on.  Look at it.  Seriously, take your time and observe it.  Scroll through each picture and slowly review each one.  And like me, you will realize this thing is basically a few simple cuts of plywood that have been stained and assembled using the cheapest legs you can purchase from your local hardware store.  Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!

I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Great quality stone but ring itself will turn colors quickly. I was highly satisfied with with stone itself. The band thickness is okay but turned my finger colors within a couple days wear. I avoided washing hands and lotion while wearing. This was not great value product. I've bought cheaper rings that didn't turn.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: quality is non-existent I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Box arrived but contents did not :( I found the earrings very pretty online, but when the box arrived it was empty.  I received a refund from amazon, but what I really wanted was to have the earrings on time, they were for a birthday.

If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them. Also, the material made my ears react to them and I have never has this problem before

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth the price! I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Engraving very hard to see against the rose gold. The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color.

I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Be prepared for the smell. Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Tabs for hanging medals are razor sharp!!! For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!

A very dangerous situation for yourself and anyone around.  The price is reasonable for what you get, but at that price range you’d expect a better fit for your knives.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Dead starfish are pretty? It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.

Otherwise, I would have given it a 1. The greenery is plastic, not realistic looking at all. There were hot glue strands all over the ears that I had to remove. It claims to be 10”, but from the top of the ear to the bottom of the wreath, it is 7”. From ear to ear across, it is only 9”. I feel like I was completely ripped off.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: I don't love these I don't love these. They are very dainty, which I wanted, but because there is no real clasp to them and you just have to close the ends together they get stuck in my ear and it hurts. I'm constantly adjusting them to makw them look okay. They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes. I probably wouldn't buy these again. Very light weight and dainty but that was the only part I liked about them

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: D20 Dragon Pendant *UPDATE* After I gave this to my friend, she went two days and one of the horns fell off according to her. She wears pendants and such quite often so I don't think it was a matter of carelessness on her part. I haven't seen how broken the piece is but when it's a gift that breaks after just two days, it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift and I must say the customization in colors and design are great. I love the selection that's available and it really helps to make it a unique gift. At first I didn't know if it would be too big, since I've seen some 20 sided die that are huge, but it's a perfect size to display the dragon and die without being too heavy. Awesome work, you rolled a 20

I opened it and the the 3 pictures were like the flimsy 8x10's that come in the 20 dollar elementary school portrait package from back in the Dinosaur era.  I giggled uncontrollably, for a few at my misfortune and politely sealed the envelope back up and placed in the spring cleaning in the summer box!!!

This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: NOT SURE IF MINE CAME FROM THIS BUSINESS When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with "Our Anniversary"  [our names] and  [date]  with  "25 years  and Counting".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  "Magnetic" pages is just a new name for old school "press & stick" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Fades and turns color My mom wanted to buy my son his first bracelet so she asked me to find one that I liked. I came across this one and chose to go with this option as it was a great price and had great reviews. My son was only able to wear it for about a week as it turned silver/blackish. When I first opened it I loved it ,but it truly is poor quality and would not recommend it all as it is a waste of money and lasts so little.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed with fit I submitted my prescription measurements hoping to have an equivalent to a medical supply company but when it arrived it looked great! but... too wide and too long to fit and restrict the finger from over extension.

After another week or so, I tried to contact the seller again but my only option was to return it without correction. I am very disappointed.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Underwhelmed I had high hopes for this necklace and was very underwhelmed at the size of the chain and the ball beads.<br />I had trouble putting on and taking off the necklace by myself and I think that whenever I wear it, it will really not be noticed or add anything to my overall look.  The chain is so small I could not even get a focused photo of it. The closest I could do was when it was still in its little bag (the bag is 1 1/2" x 2 1/2"). Each bead is about 1/16" width.<br />Although it is in a "velvet pouch" (see photo 5 with the "G" the company name partly missing), the necklace was not "ready to give". It was in a small plastic bag and that bag was sealed inside aslightly larger plastic film. If you were going to present this as a gift, you need to do some rewrapping to prevent it from looking so cheap.

Looked much better hanging though so I was happy with it until the screw that goes into the pendant just came out on its own.

I noticed right away it was kind of uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to it being something new and irritation from changing to a hoop. Well 9 hours later my nose is forming a bump where the hole is and it's even more irritating, itching and starting to get uncomfortable. I sadly have to take it out before it gets too bad! I guess it will be a stud for now. I never had an issue with nose bones, which is what i like to use. This is the first time I had an issue with jewelry.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I went for a more expensive one and that was a mistake I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful but lacking full protection I just loved this cover...but it allowed my screen protector to crack twice.  First time I thought it must've been due to a drop, but didn't recall it ever dropping.  I got a warranty replacement for my screen protector and the very next day I heard it crack!  All I did is put my phone down face down. The bumpers on the side didn't protect it at all as the edges of the protector was scratched up as well. I don't dare have a phone without a screen protector so this beautiful case just doesn't work for me...but I sure wish it did. Because I already got a warranty replacement for the first one, I have to pay bucks to pay for another protector...and a new case. I understand I won't get a full refund because it's been used some, so I'm doubly screwed.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Until the bracelet broke my teen had rated this Valentine's gift 5 *s UPDATE: Unfortunately, the bracelet broke over the weekend of 02/24/2023 the rattail cording snapped, and my teen lost 5 of the 6 beads that were released when the bracelet broke. Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.

Not as convenient as this style but better. I can see this getting lots of lint, dust or whatever into and on holder/tissue; plus I'd be washing it a lot. Not worth it.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Pointless I’m not sure why this is even a thing. It doesn’t break down buildup. It has a color so it’s making you believe it worked or works and it really ain’t doing anything
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not blue, not as pictured Not as pictured. It doesn’t look like a sapphire. What a shame. It was part of a gift and very disappointed.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Small and not good if it rains. I bought it for squirrels since it said it was for squirrels but it is too small and within a week of off and on rain the seeds were sprouting. I would have given it 1 star but it came fast.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Looks like the print, lacking quality The print arrived in the color and size anticipated, however it is printed on paper slightly thicker than printer paper. It is not a matte finish. The print was mailed in an unpadded envelope and arrived with blemishes. Theackage was torn on the outside. Very disappointed in the quality. For nearly $15, I expected more.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: You better be a professional This is not as easy as it looks. I did not successfully install it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Quality isn’t good. After couple days it started coming off. I bought peel and stick but it started coming off the wall in the 2 days. Also, picture quality is not great. You would have to cut and align them to make a proper picture. It came in 4 different sheet cuts, and after that I had to cut into multiple places to align all the flowers. I tried reaching out to seller but no response.<br />I spent $400 to cover one small wall, and I was expecting a quality wallpaper. I had it professionally installed but still didn’t work out for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: ended up with silver which isn’t even an option to buy Bummer these are super cute but I ended up with a large bag of glittery silver Mickey heads and I ordered black/white. Hopefully they give a full refund including shipping so I can rebuy the correct colors again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Sry difficult to put on Wanted to love these (I bought 2). Can’t put it on by myself.  Following order directions, it would fit, but two lobster claw connections (which are so large, they unbalance the thin bolo order) make it impossible to put on!  It also says “remove when sleeping!?  I track my sleep with my leaf, so.....help me understand that one
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: do not buy it I loved the ring at first.. it was a nice size and it fit well. I loved watching it change colors. not even a week after I bought it the stone fell right off. and no amount of super glue in the world would hold it together.. very disappointed
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: SO cute but doesn’t hold up well. I really like the size of the letter on my finger. Looks very dainty, which was the goal. However, I’ve worn it for three days and caught it on a thread and a price tag while shopping and it bent both times (I reshape it myself). I don’t think it’ll hold up long with everyday wear. I knew it would be a thin band but I didn’t think thin would also mean really mailable and weak — simile to a wire. I’ll enjoy the wear I do get from it but wouldn’t buy again.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: So small! I know that the size is listed as part of the "oh by the way" information, but who looks at dimensions carefully? The picture makes the tank look way bigger than it actually is!  So, I guess my bad on this, but if you're looking to use this as a classroom object -- it's going to be way too small for the whole room to see.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful, but doesn't fit well to face I wanted to love this mask.  (Well...as much as anyone can "love" a mask, lol!)<br />The rooster applique is beautiful.<br />However, I also want a mask to be somewhat, well, *practical.*  The fit is horrible.  It gapes.  Just pulling it more against the face does not fix the fitting problem.  I am so bummed.  It is the worst fitting mask I've every tried.  The package says on it that once open, it cannot be returned for sanitary reasons.  I understand...but there was no way I was going to know how it fit until *after* I opened the package.  As it is, perhaps I'll purchase another black mask from a maker that I have already seen makes a well-fitting mask, and move the rooster applique to that mask.  :(

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: NOT SILVER CHEAP METAL! Most uncomfortable noise ring I've ever worn in my life. Says it is Sterling silver, maybe plated, but is definitely nickel or some other cheap metal. It tarnished and caused severe irritation to my piercing (redness, tenderness, and swelling) and NO my piercing is not new, it was done over a decade ago. For around the same price, sometimes less, you can get a 4pk of nose rings from Ruffian that are WAY BETTER, in my opinion, they've never caused me any issues and I've used them for almost 3 years now. It makes me genuinely sad, this was so cute and I had such high hopes. Don't get me wrong, IT IS SUPER CUTE, I was in love with it when I first put it in, but after barely a day my nose was soooo sore and when I took out the nose ring to look at my piercing the ring was black, washed my piercing immediately and put in a hoop from my Ruffian pack and was fine in a couple days, haven't had a problem since.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Picture is misleading. Read description before purchase. I love the sticker but I don't like that it was shown as black and it's written in the fine print that it's actually white.  No use for a white sticker on a white car.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Really small I didn’t realize how tiny this would be. The picture makes it look so big, and honestly it was the size of my finger nail. And the embossed leave with your initial is so faint it is sort of pointless. I also don’t believe it is genuine turquoise, which is the stone I ordered. It sounds like plastic resin when you tap on it. I also spent more money upgrading to the sterling silver chain, and sterling silver always has to be indicated with the 925 label. The chain doesn’t look like sterling silver at all. I pretty much feel like I got ripped off. I ended up going to a different store and buying a legitimate turquoise necklace.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Rape review I thought the product was terrible. I have used Rape many times before, and have found this to be awful. Purchasing it from a reliable source like Four visions, it is a much better product. Four visions supplies an original version of the Amazonian Rape
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Easily broken Locket is way too small for pictures or any momentum. Both chain and rope chain broke very easily.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Little to no regards to packaging for delivery Photo arrived in a thin shipping cardboardish shipping envelope stuffed in a plastic shipping bag. Results, photo with several creases and bends in it. To think it took more than a week to rcv a damaged poorly printed, photo. Id been far better off printing this out from my home printer working from a screenshot of the product. Couldn't be more disappointed in the overall quality and lack of care that was took when packaging for shipment. Had this been put inside a cardboard box with bubble wrap and the box arrived beat up and damaged, I would understand that it was likely the shipping company that done this, however this was clearly a lack of care by the seller because of the manner in which it left their possession in the first place. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Beauty fades... literally! I initially loved this product! It was high gloss, had super rich colors, a deep black background, and sturdy weight. By the six week mark, the colors drastically started to fade. The rich black background turned a peachy color. I contacted the seller. They quickly sent me a replacement. Then.... six more weeks passed and the same thing happened! It is hanging in my office and receives no direct sunlight. I’m highly disappointed. The seller gave me the option of returning the item for a refund. I opted not to due to the cost of return shipping.

Nothing about this item is real but the cardboard box, I would doubt the chain is even plated silver, let alone actual silver. The "pearl" isn't even good costume jewelry, and the paint was flaking off when it arrived. They could have used a shell pearl instead of cultured and fooled most people... but nope wanted to cut all costs and used plastic beads. Ridiculous. I can't stand deceptive sellers, stay away!

So yes, I was surprised and disappointed that I payed over $13... for a photo.  We will try to make it work for what we planned but it likely was just $13 I wasted.  I am not returning it, as there was nothing wrong with it.  It just was not what I expected, I purchase.

It just looks like part of the design. You could write instructions on the back of the card, but who wants to do that if you are sending out a large amount. And you can't write on the front because its dark in color.<br />They need to add a simple "scratch here" or something to the silver sticker or the back of the card- otherwise they are pretty much useless. Disappointing.

Within an hour of wearing it turned my whole chest black. I have written to them twice now and they refuse to respond. Not worth the effort.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: ... even see the floral details and it wasn't dimensional like you see in the photo This ring was so small I could not even see the floral details and it wasn't dimensional like you see in the photo.  It would be good for a little girl's first ring but not an adult.  I returned it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Only buy this if you plan to put the name on a completely flat surface First off, I love how the lettering looks, and was very excited to put it in my little girls loft. The wall I tried to put this on is only a little bit textured and the name didn’t even try to stick! I was so disappointed. I followed the directions, waited, and nothing! It just sucks that I’m out the money now and all I have is a tail. There should be something somewhere saying only buy this if you plan to put the name on a completely flat and smooth surface.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not as advertised This case does not hold the 2 fluid ounce paint bottles as advertised and I have several different brands. It did not work for any of them. It was also very difficult to put together and you need super glue. Definitely overpriced for what it is.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Pretty This item was not as big as it appeared and the material is awful! The design is nice but don’t wash it w other items bc it runs.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Late arrival First the delivery took much longer than expected. It came in a week late, which was frustrating because I went with them because of the estimated delivery dates. Also you should not try to repostion the decals once you put it on the cup, mine came apart and the letter broke. Other than those two things, the decals looked great, loved the lettering and the colors!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: They broke the first time I wore them These earrings are adorable but unfortunately the orange part disconnected from the silver fox on one of the earrings - about 3 hours into my first time wearing them. Very disappointing!
