True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Wasn’t good for nose ring. Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful but broke an hour after wearing! The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It smells nice [[VIDEOID:8b03a70c569f973cb64c965e426c8895]] Whipped?  Not so much. I got a half jar of brown scented oil. But it does have a nice scent.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Don’t waste your time I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Smaller than we wanted Ok but smaller than we thought.  Always read the measurements!
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too small Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Very small It was just a small ceramic ornament cute but certainly not worth $25
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Disappointing I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Save your money! No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheap. Made in China. Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Ring I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: looks nice Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not at all as advertised Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: waste of my money and damage to my skin first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Fake This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Do NOT purchase!!!!! I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them. I've worn backless shoes many times, & could easily keep them on. These do not stay on my feet! Sad thing is, they are non returnable!!! What a rip off! Guess I learned my lesson!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Fell apart After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Boo This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.
