True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Not what I was expecting at all. The CZ is super dull- it’s grayish in color and not sparkly at all. I work in jewelry and I don’t think this is actually even a CZ. The metal was disappointing too. Almost like a brushed brass instead of polished gold like the photo, and made my ear itch. I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!

Had to throw it in the trash.

Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.

The images are cute, but they’re impossible to remove the sticker from the paper without ripping the entire sticker. I was able to salvage 16 stickers, the rest ripped and went right in the garbage. The break in the paper should make them easy peel in theory, but in actuality not the case. Very disappointed that I spent $10 on these stickers. Save your money, or just throw $10 in the trash.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not as high quality as advertised The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!

There was no hole in the box it was shipped in, so it had to be done before they packaged it to ship out. See indention and hole in poster in photos.

Was able to put it in no problem, about a week of wearing it and for the first time in 10 years of me having my nose pierced it starts hurting.. we’ll the nose ring has somehow caused an infection and bruised my piercing hole. Very sad and disappointed

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed I don't know if you can see it but highly disappointed I received at tarnish nose piercing this isn't sterling silver 😡
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: DONT BUY! I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Great quality stone but ring itself will turn colors quickly. I was highly satisfied with with stone itself. The band thickness is okay but turned my finger colors within a couple days wear. I avoided washing hands and lotion while wearing. This was not great value product. I've bought cheaper rings that didn't turn.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: quality is non-existent I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Box arrived but contents did not :( I found the earrings very pretty online, but when the box arrived it was empty.  I received a refund from amazon, but what I really wanted was to have the earrings on time, they were for a birthday.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: These are too small for my ear. I think ... These are too small for my ear. I think that it is not actually 8mm. The clasp is ridiculously hard to put on, and it took 3 people and an hour to get these on. Once on, they are too small and hug my ear tightly without moving. These are also extremely bendable. If these fit, and the clasp was different they would be cute, but they are also really flimsy and get out of shape just when you touch them. Also, the material made my ears react to them and I have never has this problem before
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Letters Peeling Off The shirts were amazing! It looks just like the pucture. They were soft and run true to size. The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth the price! I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Engraving very hard to see against the rose gold. The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name.

I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Stem is too short Beautiful nosering and reasonable shipping time. Two-star rating only because the stem of the nosering is way too short and doesn't poke all the way through the piercing. Sadly I'm unable to wear it.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Be prepared for the smell. Not very impressed. The shelves appear to smell like they have be stained only a day or two before they were shipped out. The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Other superior items available... These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Very Disappointed In Size I was going to give it 1 star, but gave it 2, because the item itself is not only very pretty, but of good quality. However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.

The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Do not buy this. Poor quality and  Returning it is impossible. This sweatshirt is absolute garbage. It is thin, poor quality and the graphic on the sweatshirt was crooked and bled onto other parts of the sweatshirt as if it was folded up before it was dry..And on top of that the return policy is such a hassle I am just going to keep it anyway. Also.. if you DO decide To deal with returning it they charge a 20% fee.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth the risk. Beautiful toy but the balls on the rope didn't seem particularly secure to me. The rope part just looked glued in. It's possible it would have been fine but it seemed like it could be a choking hazard especially since this is designed for very young babies.

I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Volume & Power buttons disabled This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Doesn't fit over my bird's head Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: No Lather! Definitely not what I expected. Has absolutely no lather to it at all. Smell is good. Seems to be too oil based. Would not purchase again!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Dead starfish are pretty? It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not as described, overpriced, extremely small. Extremely overpriced for the size. I gave it 2 stars simply because it is cute and Mickey Mouse. Otherwise, I would have given it a 1. The greenery is plastic, not realistic looking at all. There were hot glue strands all over the ears that I had to remove. It claims to be 10”, but from the top of the ear to the bottom of the wreath, it is 7”. From ear to ear across, it is only 9”. I feel like I was completely ripped off.

They are very dainty, which I wanted, but because there is no real clasp to them and you just have to close the ends together they get stuck in my ear and it hurts. I'm constantly adjusting them to makw them look okay. They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes. I probably wouldn't buy these again. Very light weight and dainty but that was the only part I liked about them

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Blame it on the Postal System This product is not the quality of a similar product that I have purchased elsewhere in the past.  The glitter is only on one side of the words.  The vinyl is very thin and floppy.  The wooden skewers that are glued to the vinyl of course get cake icing on them making you wonder if it is safe to use again.  This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not absorbent and wicking - stays wet. I washed product as directed -twice, with no softener of any kind. Dried it and placed in the clean cage. Within hours parts of it were soaked and the debris such as hay, straw pellets and poop would not entirely sweep up because they were sticking to the wet spots. Within a day I had to change the cage back to the paper bedding I was using because it stunk. The positive points are - it is a very cute print, is well sewn and thick. It was a generous size with some material left over.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: NOT SURE IF MINE CAME FROM THIS BUSINESS When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with "Our Anniversary"  [our names] and  [date]  with  "25 years  and Counting".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  "Magnetic" pages is just a new name for old school "press & stick" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.

So frustrated considering I paid a total of $26.26. AND it arrived late.<br /><br />On the bright side, they put it in a cute watermelon package 😂

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Thin and Flimsy There's a similar appearing item on etsy that is much more substantial for only $5 more, a very high quality and structured bag. This bag is a very thin and flimsy very basic canvas tote with a zipper top and the pocket organizer is tiny compared to the bag so its more like another random item tossed in than anything helpful. The embroidery is nice though, unfortunately however that makes it unreturnable.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Good luck! I wanted to get a nose print of my dog before she died, but the "putty" that you are supposed to use must have been old. When I followed the directions to soften it up it just became harder and consequently, I was not able to get a decent nose print from my dog. She soon passed afterwards, and I spent money on this--for nothing.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Poor quality 3D print job Probably should have read the reviews first. I was expecting something metal for it to be "LPL style."<br /><br />For the price, plastic makes more sense, but the quality is pretty lame. It's poorly a poor quality 3D print job. It feels incredibly cheap, and the "resolution" is pretty terrible. It's covered in coarse lines all over.<br /><br />Just buy your own 3D printer and make your own. Then you'll have a 3D printer!

I opened them and instantly noticed that they are completely tarnished! I ordered silver on silver, but as you can see from the picture they are not silver! I was also disappointed by the look of them, they are much larger than I was expecting and they look cheaply made. I will be returning for a refund because even if they weren’t tarnished I am not happy with them.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I've changed my mind. When I first reviewed this ring I gave it 5 stars and said it was exactly what I wanted.  Well I have changed my mind.  When I first recieved this ring it was a beautiful shiny gold. I wore it for an hour then put it back in the box it came in.  A few days later when I go to wear the ring, to my surprise it is now a tarnished almost copper gold.  Very dissapointed.  Bought a similar ring from different seller and same thing happened.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Underwhelmed I had high hopes for this necklace and was very underwhelmed at the size of the chain and the ball beads.<br />I had trouble putting on and taking off the necklace by myself and I think that whenever I wear it, it will really not be noticed or add anything to my overall look.  The chain is so small I could not even get a focused photo of it. The closest I could do was when it was still in its little bag (the bag is 1 1/2" x 2 1/2"). Each bead is about 1/16" width.<br />Although it is in a "velvet pouch" (see photo 5 with the "G" the company name partly missing), the necklace was not "ready to give". It was in a small plastic bag and that bag was sealed inside aslightly larger plastic film. If you were going to present this as a gift, you need to do some rewrapping to prevent it from looking so cheap.

Looked much better hanging though so I was happy with it until the screw that goes into the pendant just came out on its own. Probably could fix it with super glue but at this point I don't even care. Save your money and buy from a different manufacturer.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I went for a more expensive one and that was a mistake I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful but lacking full protection I just loved this cover...but it allowed my screen protector to crack twice.  First time I thought it must've been due to a drop, but didn't recall it ever dropping.  I got a warranty replacement for my screen protector and the very next day I heard it crack!  All I did is put my phone down face down. The bumpers on the side didn't protect it at all as the edges of the protector was scratched up as well. I don't dare have a phone without a screen protector so this beautiful case just doesn't work for me...but I sure wish it did. Because I already got a warranty replacement for the first one, I have to pay bucks to pay for another protector...and a new case. I understand I won't get a full refund because it's been used some, so I'm doubly screwed.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Until the bracelet broke my teen had rated this Valentine's gift 5 *s UPDATE: Unfortunately, the bracelet broke over the weekend of 02/24/2023 the rattail cording snapped, and my teen lost 5 of the 6 beads that were released when the bracelet broke. Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Honest Review I give 2/5 stars. The actual stones are gorgeous, the clasp & chain turns colors. I wish it stayed silver, makes the bracelet look really cheap. If that could be fixed with silver, it’d be very nice.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not as nice as pictured Not as nice as pictured.  Disappointed and not worth the price.  They also came in a small plastic baggie without any wrapping or protection and were in an envelope with books smushed at the bottom.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very lightweight and poorly made Ended up returning this sink. It was extremely light weight and I don't think would have help up to typical wear on a bathroom sink. Did not look at all like real copper.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Completly sheer/see through I wish I had known before purchasing that this was going to be sheer/see through. Tried wearing a tank top under it, a white bra, everything and it just didn't look like. Even with pasties on, those show through.<br /><br />I wanted to support small business and they left a cute note with the shirt but I was still highly disappointed. Just be aware that its completly sheer and see through before purchasing.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty,, but ,, This is pretty,  but very very flimsy..
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Really small I didn’t realize how tiny this would be. The picture makes it look so big, and honestly it was the size of my finger nail. And the embossed leave with your initial is so faint it is sort of pointless. I also don’t believe it is genuine turquoise, which is the stone I ordered. It sounds like plastic resin when you tap on it. I also spent more money upgrading to the sterling silver chain, and sterling silver always has to be indicated with the 925 label. The chain doesn’t look like sterling silver at all. I pretty much feel like I got ripped off. I ended up going to a different store and buying a legitimate turquoise necklace.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Rape review I thought the product was terrible. I have used Rape many times before, and have found this to be awful. Purchasing it from a reliable source like Four visions, it is a much better product. Four visions supplies an original version of the Amazonian Rape
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Easily broken Locket is way too small for pictures or any momentum. Both chain and rope chain broke very easily. The heart itself was pretty and unique, but not made for any pictures. Not worth the 80 something dollars I paid for it. Wanted it to place some hair of my dead husband into.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Discoloured Wore them for 2 weeks on and off during the holiday. I purchase the blue and green color in cold metal. The gold was vibrant sort of like the 24k hold color.

As much as loved the rings I could not justify the price of $100 for both

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Little to no regards to packaging for delivery Photo arrived in a thin shipping cardboardish shipping envelope stuffed in a plastic shipping bag. Results, photo with several creases and bends in it. To think it took more than a week to rcv a damaged poorly printed, photo. Id been far better off printing this out from my home printer working from a screenshot of the product. Couldn't be more disappointed in the overall quality and lack of care that was took when packaging for shipment. Had this been put inside a cardboard box with bubble wrap and the box arrived beat up and damaged, I would understand that it was likely the shipping company that done this, however this was clearly a lack of care by the seller because of the manner in which it left their possession in the first place. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo paper design appears dirty I knew what I was getting on quality. What I did not realize, and now do somewhat by looking at item more online, is that there is a faint design on the photo paper that makes the background look dirty. I actually tried to wipe it off! It does not compliment the other design elements on the print. I don't even think I could display. Impulse purchase that I regret.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Looks are deceiving. Image is deceiving as it looks heavier and antiquish in the picture, but its actually thin metal on a thin chain. Way over priced for what you get. Very disappointed and too exensive to ship back at over 20.00 with their return label. So stuck with it. Let the buyer beware.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Beauty fades... literally! I initially loved this product! It was high gloss, had super rich colors, a deep black background, and sturdy weight. By the six week mark, the colors drastically started to fade. The rich black background turned a peachy color. I contacted the seller. They quickly sent me a replacement. Then.... six more weeks passed and the same thing happened! It is hanging in my office and receives no direct sunlight. I’m highly disappointed. The seller gave me the option of returning the item for a refund. I opted not to due to the cost of return shipping.

Nothing about this item is real but the cardboard box, I would doubt the chain is even plated silver, let alone actual silver. The "pearl" isn't even good costume jewelry, and the paint was flaking off when it arrived. They could have used a shell pearl instead of cultured and fooled most people... but nope wanted to cut all costs and used plastic beads. Ridiculous. I can't stand deceptive sellers, stay away!

So yes, I was surprised and disappointed that I payed over $13... for a photo.  We will try to make it work for what we planned but it likely was just $13 I wasted.  I am not returning it, as there was nothing wrong with it.  It just was not what I expected, I purchase.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Metal around stone turns red Hi, I recently bought 3 sterling silver bracelets from you in July 2022. All 3 identical, 1 for myself and the other two for friends. This for me, just graduating college was a lot to spend. I was so excited when I received them. They were beautiful. But,  as I’ve worn mine daily since 7/29/22, the metal around the gems is red. Your website claimed the item to be sterling silver (925). I’m so disappointed and embarrassed since I gave the other two as gifts and they are in the same shape as mine. What a shamble. Annoyed and embarrassed.
