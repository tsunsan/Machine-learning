True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheap It’s a cute necklace but it breaks very easily. Honestly not worth the price.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality I received it and it was already flimsy. Snapped immediately.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Very cheaply made but not for a cheap price I ordered 2 for my daughter for Easter. One arrived broken, one of the tint silver balls was not glued in place. The earring itself is extremely thin n feels like it would break very easily. And the ends to put into your piercing hole, is so rough and it will definitely hurt to put in, I'm sure.<br />This is cheaply made but yet not a cheap price. Definitely will never buy from this seller again

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Underestimated gift This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Decent smelling, long time to ship though Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not impressed This is a paper poster not a sign as I thought it was advertised to be
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful but broke an hour after wearing! The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too small Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Not happy... Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Disappointing I waited months for this product to arrive. I made a point to position the tablet so the shower would not hit it. It lasted 15 seconds in the shower. Over priced for a product that lasts 15 seconds.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: poor quality The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The hanger is beautiful but the wording is not sturdy at all! The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Does not smell .... I order it because the amazing reviews but I did not receive any letter or special packaging and that’s ok... but I expected some smell from the oil. it seems to be very diluited it does not smell like an essential oil. I dont recomend this product.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I made a buying mistake. Didn't read the description clearly. I thought I was buying the dish.  Turns out I could use the item so no return.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Paper thin & flimsy Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Lavendar Sage melt - disappointed "not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap. Made in China. Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: looks nice Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: CHEAP QUALITY! They were thin and danity, which is what i wanted.. but if you plan on taking them on and off every day, good luck! They are very thin, extremely hard to latch and they bend and distort very easily. I could make these at home with some wire for less then what i paid for these. Save your money!!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not at all as advertised Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Loves nice things Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.
True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Don't like it Leaves a sticky feel on my hair and has a weird smell that's unplesant.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Eh.. It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Boo This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.
