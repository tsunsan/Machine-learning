True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Underestimated gift This was much smaller than I expected.  Not really happy with the final product.  The color of the November stone almost looks clear.  The writing is so small it it almost impossible to read.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Decent smelling, long time to ship though Wax smells decent enough- not exactly what I imagined or was hoping for, but that's the danger in ordering online. Package shipped on April 26 and didn't arrive until May 9, so just a heads up that it will take a long time to get to you (I ordered on April 24)
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Beautiful but broke an hour after wearing! The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: It smells nice [[VIDEOID:8b03a70c569f973cb64c965e426c8895]] Whipped?  Not so much. I got a half jar of brown scented oil. But it does have a nice scent.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Too small Shirts came out really cute but the women size shirt did not go according to plan. I normally wear a Lg and went XL. My mom wears a M and she went L. No go. My mom tried my XL and it barely fit her. Don’t go one size up go like 3 sizes in the women’s Ts.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Not happy... Not worth $19.99. It's very thin and the bark was falling off in the package. This is more like a $7 item.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Incorrect description of product I was very disappointed to find that that this 2-pack of frames, which were both to hold 4 X 6 photos, turned out to be one for a 4 X 6 photo, and one for a 5 X 7 photo. They will not be the matched pair I had planned on.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: poor quality The first time i wore these earrings the cameo fell off never to be found or worn again
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: The hanger is beautiful but the wording is not sturdy at all! The hanger looks beautiful but the name and date is not sturdy at all. I took it out of the box very carefully and the words bent very easily.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: I made a buying mistake. Didn't read the description clearly. I thought I was buying the dish.  Turns out I could use the item so no return.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Paper thin & flimsy Nice looking but they are so thin and flimsy. When I say paper thin, I mean it. More like a sticker than a magnet. Doesn’t stick well either. Don’t have time to order elsewhere or I would.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Trash It was just a few prints. Nothing special. I guess you get what you pay for.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Lavendar Sage melt - disappointed "not at all what I expected; the scent did not smell like Lavender fragrance; I was disappointed; one of my favorite wax-melt fragrances is Lavender, but will not consider ordering this brand in the future.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Cheap. Made in China. Barely look like the photo, not blue like they should be, the ‘gold’ is cheap and tacky looking. Huge disappointment.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Ring I don't buy these specifically because they have really bad gold weight.<br />I only buy rings like this where the Gold it not HOLLOW behind the ring.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: looks nice Yes this looks nice, but there doesn't seem to be any healing properties, I was hoping for better sleep, and feel more energy.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not at all as advertised Doesn’t look like the item I bought. Cheap chain and no leather strap. I hate it! Do not order from this vendor!
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: waste of my money and damage to my skin first off the quality matched the price. i purchased a cheap personalized necklace from amazon before but the vendor was no longer available so i tried this one ... never again the name looks horrible and i was still going to wear it because it has my sons name but it has my neck broke out so bad i just threw it away !
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Loves nice things Very small, not worth the money.  Would not have bought if I had seen out.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Very delicate Very frail, broke easily. Should be sold for less.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Fake This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Eh.. It is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I am already looking for a replacement as it is scratched up pretty good. Also, it is much smaller than I had imagined. Don't buy this. Was a waste of money for sure.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Boo This was a gift for my niece, she loves it but I do not, because I know better.  She loves anything I gift her but truly the quality of this was as if I would have laminated it myself at home, honestly, that may have been better.  The material is cheap, not sturdy enough, and the font is not legible.  I will not order this again.
