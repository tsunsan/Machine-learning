True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Breathable but not a good fit The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Good concept I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Rip Off. They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Cost and Quality This product is literally garbage.  It looks like someone scoured old construction sites until they found a piece of water warped plywood that they could use to make this sign.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Meh... I personalized these, keeping in mind the limited number of letters that are allowed in the edit. I did not get what I asked for. Seller did not communicate or contact me that my order could not be made even though I did not go over the letter count.  The seller should just ask for a name and age and not give false hope with false customization claims. These also appear glossy online but are just black and yellow ink on a dull matte finish.

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Tiny circumference. Disappointed Too small for my son who doesn't have a large neck; it was for his birthday. I gave it 2 stars because I really like it, but it's small for a man or a woman. During the virus shutdown, I didn't want to risk going out to have it returned so I could receive a refund, so I am stuck trying to find a male friend or family member with a neck small enough that this necklace isn't too small nor would it look like a choker on them; I may have to give it to someone's child.

This is good for those who don't mind the extra work, but I made the mistake of impulse purchasing, without reading and unfortunately I am stuck with a kit I have to file, sand and assemble, which is not something I'm good at and not comfortable doing. Hopefully I won't mess it up. Lesson learned! Just thought I'd share from experience.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Seller Wrote Wrong Date on Shirt I loved the sweatshirt and so did my friend - so comfy and cute. But she gets married in 2022 and the sweatshirt says 2023. They wouldn’t return or exchange the sweatshirt for the correct one and I couldn’t find proof anywhere that I put 2023. I ordered ANOTHER one for 2022 and still received a 2023 shirt. Sad because I was really looking forward to this sweatshirt.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Not terrible So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Pretty but doesn’t stick well Very pretty but it has so many tiny pieces and they don’t stick well. I followed the directions and the sticker has been on for not even 1 week and after I had washed and dried my Yeti, some of the stickers are coming off. It was a waste of money since I’m going to have to remove it. Disappointing.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Way too short in length. What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not as high quality as advertised The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Terrible quality and arrived damaged So, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in these. I ordered two and spent a good bit. Too much to be dealing with these kinds of issues.<br />First, one arrived damaged. As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

That was several days ago, so I am definitely not satisfied.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Doesn't work I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the "clasp" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: DONT BUY! I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Great quality stone but ring itself will turn colors quickly. I was highly satisfied with with stone itself.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: quality is non-existent I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth the price! I was very disappointed in this item. It showed it in a frame in the photo. This is something I could print from my computer for free. I can’t believe they charged me over $16 plus $9 shipping for a piece of paper with words printed on card stock. My daughter was very disappointed about this! Now I have to go find a frame or send it back.  I would send it back immediately if it weren’t a birthday gift. I still might.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Engraving very hard to see against the rose gold. The font is too thin and too light against the sparkly rose gold color. The word “flower girl” is barely noticeable in any type of lighting. You have to turn the bottle a certain way to see the name. I wish the engraving came in a different color or at least a little thicker. Did not meet my expectations like the photos

I own a lot of silver & moonstone jewelry; stone shades always vary. But I'd never choose a colorless, faded-out stone like this. Might as well be cheap glass shard. ZERO color or interest. So disappointing.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed Disney fan This shirt is super soft but the color is horrible and the fit is strange- the neck is very high cut, circling the base of the neck rather than around the bottom like a typical round neck tee. The color is mustard yellow- a bright orange/yellow that is displeasing to the eye. I read the other reviews before purchasing and knew it would be bright- but not the mustard tone. I’m really disappointed and don’t plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. I ordered Belle Mickey ears to match and the colors are nothing alike.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Pretty but not all there I thought these would be solid, but a piece of the turquoise was missing on one earring, and underneath it appeared to be just a gray stone or rock. I have no idea. Maybe that's how copper turquose is made, just a thin film applied over something else? So if that's true, then they are overpriced!  If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality. They arrived in a really thin envelope package and the ear hooks were flattened and I had to re-expand them just to try them on (maybe that's how they got damaged, in transit). I returned them.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Caveat Emptor - Shoddy Product This is an extremely shoddy product.  It's as if the seller bought a do-it-yourself magnet kit, proceeded to cut pictures from an old promotional pamphlet and put together a "finished" product.

Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet.

Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price.

These things are so cheap, it's crazy that this was over $10, let alone over $20.<br />This was not a good purchase, the metal is so thin that it bends easier than a paperclip does. I know they are supposed to be adjustable, but just walking in sandals wearing them has reformed the entire shape. My guess, I will be able to wear them maybe one more time before they have been bent too much and just break.<br /><br />UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE<br />It has been FIVE days since my review. The spiral ring that is like two, is broken. It kept digging into the bottom of my toe every time I walked so I turned it so the ends were on top instead. One of the ends caught on something and it pulled the metal nearly straight. When I tried to bend it back, it snapped. This has got to be one of the most irritating and WORTHLESS purchases I have ever made on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying literally ANYTHING ELSE than this!! Complete waste of money and time!

The biggest problem with this sheath is how tight it is.  I’m talking dangerously tight.  I put my BK9 in and it took everything I had to get it out.  A very dangerous situation for yourself and anyone around.  The price is reasonable for what you get, but at that price range you’d expect a better fit for your knives.  I’m sure there’s a way to reheat it and get a better fit but for a custom made sheath it’s too dangerous as is.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Dead starfish are pretty? It contains DEAD starfish.  In California, from Monterrey south, ALL THE STARFISH WE ONCE HAD NOW ARE DEAD.  They died of &#34;wasting disease,&#34; which is kind of like a leprosy that starfish get -- their limbs start rotting away.  Scientists don't know if it's from warmer water, or a form of bacteria that has developed because of climate change, or higher radiation in ocean currents that have reached the U.S. Pacific Coast from the Fukushima situation.  Or, waste from our own Diablo Canyon nuclear energy plant, which is set to go out of business in the future.  But regardless what the cause is, when our oceans die, we -- as humans -- also will die.  Oceans create much of the oxygen we breathe and the animals within the sea are an indispensable part of the chain of life.  How could anyone in their right mind start killing little precious baby starfish for a profit?  I know that there is a fishing industry -- and lots of fish are becoming quite rare now because of it, so other fish are being eaten instead.  Hence, the entry of tilapia on the market some time back, etc. and other fish that humans never ate.  Cod is much more difficult to get, and so is Chilean sea bass.  Swordfish are threatened, and tuna are much less plentiful.  Until we start farming and raising fish, we need to be careful about what we eat.  And starfish -- which were so healthy and hearty you could cut cut off two or three arms and the starfish would grow new ones and continue to live -- now have vanished in Southern California.  So, I consider it really sad when these little baby starfish are used for Christmas ornaments.  They have little to do with the meaning of Christmas or the birth of Christ, and a lot to do with the demise of life on this planet.

The picture of the Rose Quartz ‘leather chain’ pendant was a lovely pink, and even though the product info indicated that the quartz you receive will not look exactly like the picture, I expected the ‘rose’ color to be beautifully apparent.  Instead, the pink on the quartz chrystal appeared white.  The leather chord from which the chrystal is suspended looks very cheap.  For some, the weight of the fairly large chrystal may be uncomfortable.  I would give the product ‘no stars,’ but the “submit” wouldn’t work if I didn’t.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: NOT SURE IF MINE CAME FROM THIS BUSINESS When my husband told me a while back he was going to fix our wedding album for our 25th anniversary,  I had no idea he meant he was going to BUY a new one.  Maybe this business isn't the one he used, which I shudder to think there are more companies selling this album.  Regardless, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner, & coming home, a giant pkg was awaiting.  Silly me, I thought it was the latest 2021 Macbook pro or the new souped up iPad.<br /><br />Imagine my horror, when I saw this rustic photo album with "Our Anniversary"  [our names] and  [date]  with  "25 years  and Counting".  It seemed ironic since I've been declared cancer free for a year.  I had wrongly assumed my husband was going to rehab our luxurious original leather bound album that had gotten sprayed by our cat.  I had cleaned the whole album best I could, with the aim of going to a professional later.<br /><br />The album itself looks like a cheap kit.  I received the dark one, & yes, it is laser cut.  I ran my hands over each letter & number to make sure it wasn't screen printed on.  Mine looks just like the picture, with exposed hardware, & leather strips.  There is something wrong with the bottom latch, it took several attempts, but you have to jiggle it around & press down with the other finger to make it work.  Oh, how I wished I hadn't looked inside.  "Magnetic" pages is just a new name for old school "press & stick" .  These pages are not quality archival grade sleeves similar to what serious collectors use.  I own two of such photo albums from the 70s & 80s.  There is only one edge, so you lift the flap, position your photo on the sticky paper & then carefully bring over the acetate or plastic flap & smooth it out.  The problem comes with the bubbles & wrinkles, as this is not for the amature & takes experience, which dear hubs was clueless.  There is likely a tutorial somewhere that shows the best steps, & I highly recommend you do so before inserting any photos, as personalized albums are non-returnable.  With my old press & stick albums, the edge is what deteriorates first.  It turns a rust color, & loosens, & it works its way toward the photo(s).  The plastic flap becomes discolored & brittle with age, and the stickiness wears off due to air exposure, so that some pics stick, & some don't.  The one star may be harsh, but it was the tricky latch & non-archival pages, along with rough edges.  The inside back cover had something like flakes of sawdust on it.  I tried to hand, then use a cloth to  brush them off, but they must have been spray varnished on.  For those that love the rustic look, you will definitely like it.  My husband knows I'm not fond of Western/Rustic.  There is high quality rustic, then cheap rustic, which IMO (and being a city girl)  this falls under the latter.  If this is the company my husband got, he got what he paid for, in total $157.  Perhaps the album can be made without pages, & archival sleeves purchased through Creative Memories or elsewhere online if you want your album to become an heirloom.

All I did is put my phone down face down. The bumpers on the side didn't protect it at all as the edges of the protector was scratched up as well. I don't dare have a phone without a screen protector so this beautiful case just doesn't work for me...but I sure wish it did. Because I already got a warranty replacement for the first one, I have to pay bucks to pay for another protector...and a new case. I understand I won't get a full refund because it's been used some, so I'm doubly screwed.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Until the bracelet broke my teen had rated this Valentine's gift 5 *s UPDATE: Unfortunately, the bracelet broke over the weekend of 02/24/2023 the rattail cording snapped, and my teen lost 5 of the 6 beads that were released when the bracelet broke. Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Color is different then pictured My bracelet is mostly black with a few beads showing a bit of blue. Not the more grey/blue shown in the picture. I gave it two stars because the quality is good and fits great. I just wasn't looking for another black bracelet.

True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Color of ink This invite is pretty but ink is blue with no options !!
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Just OK It's nicely sewn but... I certainly expect more for the money. It's the old time style where holder is split" in middle. There's still enough opening to get debris inside holder and onto tissue. Flimsy cotton. *Cute* kitties though.<br />On photo it looked like holder had a flap and I'd have to open to pull tissue out. Not as convenient as this style but better. I can see this getting lots of lint, dust or whatever into and on holder/tissue; plus I'd be washing it a lot. Not worth it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Good.. but The design and size are very good, but the materials of the cord that adjusts the bracelet are not of good quality and not at all resistant. I have only used it twice, and one has already broken and the other is about to break.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: not good quality and will tarnish Updating my review: These have started to turn green and accumulate gunk where the backing meets the earing. The metal has turned black. I no longer feel comfortable putting these in my ears as I fear an adverse reaction with my sensitive skin or even an infection. Cannot recommend these earring any longer which is unfortunate because they were my favorite pair and looked so stunning but the quality is not where it needs to be.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Quality isn’t good. After couple days it started coming off. I bought peel and stick but it started coming off the wall in the 2 days. Also, picture quality is not great. You would have to cut and align them to make a proper picture. It came in 4 different sheet cuts, and after that I had to cut into multiple places to align all the flowers. I tried reaching out to seller but no response.<br />I spent $400 to cover one small wall, and I was expecting a quality wallpaper. I had it professionally installed but still didn’t work out for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: ended up with silver which isn’t even an option to buy Bummer these are super cute but I ended up with a large bag of glittery silver Mickey heads and I ordered black/white. Hopefully they give a full refund including shipping so I can rebuy the correct colors again.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Sry difficult to put on Wanted to love these (I bought 2). Can’t put it on by myself.  Following order directions, it would fit, but two lobster claw connections (which are so large, they unbalance the thin bolo order) make it impossible to put on!  It also says “remove when sleeping!?  I track my sleep with my leaf, so.....help me understand that one
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: do not buy it I loved the ring at first.. it was a nice size and it fit well. I loved watching it change colors. not even a week after I bought it the stone fell right off. and no amount of super glue in the world would hold it together.. very disappointed
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: SO cute but doesn’t hold up well. I really like the size of the letter on my finger. Looks very dainty, which was the goal. However, I’ve worn it for three days and caught it on a thread and a price tag while shopping and it bent both times (I reshape it myself). I don’t think it’ll hold up long with everyday wear. I knew it would be a thin band but I didn’t think thin would also mean really mailable and weak — simile to a wire. I’ll enjoy the wear I do get from it but wouldn’t buy again.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful, but doesn't fit well to face I wanted to love this mask.  (Well...as much as anyone can "love" a mask, lol!)<br />The rooster applique is beautiful.<br />However, I also want a mask to be somewhat, well, *practical.*  The fit is horrible.  It gapes.  Just pulling it more against the face does not fix the fitting problem.  I am so bummed.  It is the worst fitting mask I've every tried.  The package says on it that once open, it cannot be returned for sanitary reasons.  I understand...but there was no way I was going to know how it fit until *after* I opened the package.  As it is, perhaps I'll purchase another black mask from a maker that I have already seen makes a well-fitting mask, and move the rooster applique to that mask.  :(

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: NOT SILVER CHEAP METAL! Most uncomfortable noise ring I've ever worn in my life. Says it is Sterling silver, maybe plated, but is definitely nickel or some other cheap metal. It tarnished and caused severe irritation to my piercing (redness, tenderness, and swelling) and NO my piercing is not new, it was done over a decade ago. For around the same price, sometimes less, you can get a 4pk of nose rings from Ruffian that are WAY BETTER, in my opinion, they've never caused me any issues and I've used them for almost 3 years now. It makes me genuinely sad, this was so cute and I had such high hopes. Don't get me wrong, IT IS SUPER CUTE, I was in love with it when I first put it in, but after barely a day my nose was soooo sore and when I took out the nose ring to look at my piercing the ring was black, washed my piercing immediately and put in a hoop from my Ruffian pack and was fine in a couple days, haven't had a problem since.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Really small I didn’t realize how tiny this would be. The picture makes it look so big, and honestly it was the size of my finger nail. And the embossed leave with your initial is so faint it is sort of pointless. I also don’t believe it is genuine turquoise, which is the stone I ordered. It sounds like plastic resin when you tap on it. I also spent more money upgrading to the sterling silver chain, and sterling silver always has to be indicated with the 925 label. The chain doesn’t look like sterling silver at all. I pretty much feel like I got ripped off. I ended up going to a different store and buying a legitimate turquoise necklace.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Easily broken Locket is way too small for pictures or any momentum. Both chain and rope chain broke very easily. The heart itself was pretty and unique, but not made for any pictures. Not worth the 80 something dollars I paid for it. Wanted it to place some hair of my dead husband into.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Little to no regards to packaging for delivery Photo arrived in a thin shipping cardboardish shipping envelope stuffed in a plastic shipping bag. Results, photo with several creases and bends in it. To think it took more than a week to rcv a damaged poorly printed, photo. Id been far better off printing this out from my home printer working from a screenshot of the product. Couldn't be more disappointed in the overall quality and lack of care that was took when packaging for shipment. Had this been put inside a cardboard box with bubble wrap and the box arrived beat up and damaged, I would understand that it was likely the shipping company that done this, however this was clearly a lack of care by the seller because of the manner in which it left their possession in the first place. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Beauty fades... literally! I initially loved this product! It was high gloss, had super rich colors, a deep black background, and sturdy weight. By the six week mark, the colors drastically started to fade. The rich black background turned a peachy color. I contacted the seller. They quickly sent me a replacement. Then.... six more weeks passed and the same thing happened! It is hanging in my office and receives no direct sunlight. I’m highly disappointed. The seller gave me the option of returning the item for a refund. I opted not to due to the cost of return shipping.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Came Damaged despite nice packaging My daughter was so excited for these to come, but sadly they came with a white blemish that appears to be paint on one earring. That earring also contains scratches in the clear coating. The other earring appears well made and would be worth 5 stars for appearance, quality, and packaging. Unfortunately the ruined earring makes these unusable.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Trash This window decals came with 2 identical tears/cuts. The vynil for those 2 places was not on the transfer paper.

After looking over the images, I reloaded Minnie is very inked over with spillage from other images as well as Tinkerbell. Size small shirt has ink outside the black Mickey ears background<br /><br />Tip. Measure your favorite t shirt that fits the way you want you shirt to fit then compare those measurements to the sellers size chart to get the most accurate measurements expectations. I did this with all four of our shirts and although it took a min, I’m glad I did so I knew what to expect. Also, size up for that oversize look or if in doubt!
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Broken during the first day of wear I bought this for a young man, who liked its looks. He wore it to his Youth Group and the bracelet broke. It was less than 24 hours of wear.  So disappointing!  The beads scattered all over, making it impossible to return. He is sad, and I feel totally scammed. Any jewelry should last longer than that! Don't buy!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Hated it I was not happy with this at all. You can't read or see the letters of the name but u can read and see clearly on the back where it says I love you
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: BEWARE Amazon why do you allow this scam!! Don’t buy. Cheaply made and you can not return or exchange. YOU ARE STUCK!!  Horrible and rude customer service
True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: So Cute- But Missing One Critical Thing The design is darling except for one critical thing. It doesn't mention anywhere that you have to scratch off the silver sticker to read the message.<br />So if you aren't present when the person opens it to explain what to do- they would have no clue there is something written underneath the silver "planet." It just looks like part of the design. You could write instructions on the back of the card, but who wants to do that if you are sending out a large amount. And you can't write on the front because its dark in color.<br />They need to add a simple "scratch here" or something to the silver sticker or the back of the card- otherwise they are pretty much useless. Disappointing.

Within an hour of wearing it turned my whole chest black. I have written to them twice now and they refuse to respond. Not worth the effort.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: ... even see the floral details and it wasn't dimensional like you see in the photo This ring was so small I could not even see the floral details and it wasn't dimensional like you see in the photo.  It would be good for a little girl's first ring but not an adult.  I returned it.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Way too big! The bracelet is adorable, but definitely not sized for a little girl. The bracelet is adult sized and will not fit my 5 year old granddaughter for years.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed  - fibers are off at this rate will be gone in another two weeks. Sad and surprised. Used at back door. The fibers are coming out like crazy.  The writing is not dark like it was upon receipt. Only a couple weeks old and 2 adults live here.
True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Not as advertised This case does not hold the 2 fluid ounce paint bottles as advertised and I have several different brands. It did not work for any of them. It was also very difficult to put together and you need super glue. Definitely overpriced for what it is.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Late arrival First the delivery took much longer than expected. It came in a week late, which was frustrating because I went with them because of the estimated delivery dates. Also you should not try to repostion the decals once you put it on the cup, mine came apart and the letter broke. Other than those two things, the decals looked great, loved the lettering and the colors!
