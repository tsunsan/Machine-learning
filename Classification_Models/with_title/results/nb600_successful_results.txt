True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Picture does not match the earrings The picture shows the color of the earrings are blue, however, they are brown. So make sure you will be ok with the color they send instead of the color in the picture. I needed the blue. The color I actually received looks horrible on me.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Already Dying After 3 Weeks I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The items I ordered were misleading The items received were fit for a baby,which was misleading I ordered for grandson and granddaughter..I will never order again from that seller absolutely not..
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Just buy the key It is a little big for your pocket. I have a ford focus key that is broken, this case holds it but moves around a little too much. It is a little large for men’s pockets.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Two Stars As described but packaging could have been better for the price
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Wasn’t good for nose ring. Wasn’t happy. Returned for refund.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not quite right I am a retired police officer and spent much time at the gun range and I did not think this had the aroma of gun powder. But, they did send me a sample of OIL which I liked and thought smelled exactly like oil.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Don’t waste your time I bought these for a back up to my nose ring when I got them I should have known by the price they were cheaply made and looked like they would have fit a Barbie doll. Sent back.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Smaller than we wanted Ok but smaller than we thought.  Always read the measurements!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Very small It was just a small ceramic ornament cute but certainly not worth $25
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Too Pink Two of the prints had too much of a pink tone.  Nothing like the pictures.  Only kept them to use the other three. Tried contacting the seller. One star because seller would not respond.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Chunky It's kind of chunky and it bumped it falls apart but for the most part it stays together and does his job but it just looks a little ghetto and really big

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Looked so cute for 5 minutes They came in so cute and after the first day, with careful hand-washing, all of the decals started peeling off of both of them. So disappointing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: One Star It was not what I expected
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth it. I have worn this for 2 days and the pendant is grey/black (I couldn't even call it tarnished at this point).<br />When I purchased it claimed "sterling silver " which is why I purchased. Cheapest rubbish and after looking,  the pendant has no silver stamp on it. Don't waste your money!!!!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Save your money! No smell whatsoever. Total waste of money. I really shouldn’t even give it one star it was that bad.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Incorrect description of product I was very disappointed to find that that this 2-pack of frames, which were both to hold 4 X 6 photos, turned out to be one for a 4 X 6 photo, and one for a 5 X 7 photo. They will not be the matched pair I had planned on.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality Poor quality fabric messy writing<br />Looks like a felt pin was used<br />Plus totally gross a black hair was inside when I unfolded it
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Great Idea, Terrible execution. So sad. What I got was really awful. It was not hand printed, it was computer generated, and in addition several words were misspelled. These folks took a great concept; got in a hurry and totally ruined it. So sad because it was a great idea. They probably should have charged more and done it right.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Flag Many of the stars where misfired they did not even look close to stars, the instruction video show a piece to install the stickers and it did not come with one.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Make the poster bigger Dislike to smallpox
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Just a photo not a poster It is just a photo printed. Same thing you could do at Walmart for a few cents. The print is a nice print, but not close to being worth 13 dollars. Maybe $1.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Just a piece of paper I thought this would be something other than just a peice of photo paper - wrong! Just type this up yourself and go to Walmart to print it. It will be the same thing and cheaper.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not what I expected Shame on me for not reading the very smallll fine print. I thought these pictures were on a canvas ready to hang up but instead I have 4 printed pictures that I need to purchase a frame for. Not worth the money I paid for them.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not worth the price Cute, but probably costs less than a dollar to make.  Should not be charging more than $3, in my opinion.  It’s small, is just a printed photo, and didn’t even have the ribbon attached.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Smells like caramel, not pappy's pipe. Smells nothing like a pipe or even what's in the description.  They smell like Werther's caramel.  Very disappointed.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Could have been better. They were not aesthetically pleasing, and a few prints came creased/torn. I could only use a couple of the prints.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Fake This is a fake black tourmaline stone. It looked like it was glued together, stone was soft not hard like it should be, and not 6-sided as true black tourmaline are. Buyers that are looking for a real genuine raw black tourmaline this is not it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Think before you order The quality of the chain is fine but the arrow itself looks like it was already used and seemed oxidized. You can even see it that they both are different colors. Maybe I’ve got a copy that was returned before. I don’t know but I was disappointed

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Do NOT purchase!!!!! I was excited to receive the new shoes. Extremely disappointed to find out they flop when trying to walk in them. I've worn backless shoes many times, & could easily keep them on. These do not stay on my feet! Sad thing is, they are non returnable!!! What a rip off! Guess I learned my lesson!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Fell apart After about a month the pendant fell off and the slide not in the back unraveled!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cute but could be designed better Lightweight earring but they keep twisting backwards and getting caught or twisted within the post
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I hate the font. It says sweet dreading.  The return amount on this product was $70. It really is I had been looking at many different signs with the saying sweet dreams and I selected this one because I was able to customize the size. After ordering I realized how much I did not like the font. I tried to cancel the order but was unable to… And I tried to return the sign and it would be a $70 charge. So I’m stuck with a sweet dreading sign over my bed.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: No lo recomiendo 👎 Lo compre en octubre para regalo de Navidad de mi esposo y para sorpresa extremadamente pequeño y nada que ver para el precio, pobre calidad, el vendedor nada que te ayuda simplemente aun diciendole que esta nuevo en su cajita no acepta la devolucion por estar pasado de tiempo. Nada profesional al menos podia ayudar al cliente aunque hiciera un descuento. NO RECOMIENDO HACERLE COMPRAS A ESTE VENDEDOR. 👎👎👎
