True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.
True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

True: 0, Predicted: 2, Text: Way too short in length. What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: arrived broken I waited for this necklace for 3 weeks. While unwrapping it, I noticed several pieces. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and some how was still shattered. I spent an hour with a bottle of super glue trying to put it back together, as it was a gift. It could have been beautiful, but even with all the work putting it back together it looked awful. I would not recommend this product.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Not as high quality as advertised The wood is unfinished, there is a glue repair in the top of the table along with the purchasing sticker still attached to the bought plywood.  This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointed I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Excellent Idea, Poorly Executed I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

I couldn’t believe that they even sent that to me knowing that there was no way that they saw the recipients name. It was that bad!!! NEVER AGAIN!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheap Junk! THIS looks great in the misleading pic on Amazon.  In person; looks like something out of a bubblegum machine.  Not worth $46.  Maybe $15 and that's pushing it.  Cheap monogram lettering quality too.  I'll give it to my 16 y/o.  Perhaps she'll like it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Doesn't stick to ALL types of Walls Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much ... I have to admit that I’m NOT impressed. Actually I was highly disappointed. It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Iaco Iusday This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.  Will return.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE! DO NOT BUY! There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

The material also does not appear to be stained or protected from weather and water.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller, and unfortunately no resolution was provided by seller. There is also no refund/exchange protection for this item via Amazon. Be prepared to have no options or protection, if the item you receive does not match the photos listed.

Packaging was nice, but going back.

I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one.

I am very disappointed that this has happened so soon after very minimal wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: You get what you pay for....... I guess This would have been cute had it not been for the smudged ink and uneven pattern.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Other superior items available... These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Eh I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.

Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.

The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.

My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Don't waste your money. 1 star is being generous. I would give this product zero stars if possible.  Not only does it seem to be poorly 3d printed, but its overall junk. The plungers weren't even finished properly.<br /><br />Top that off with having to pay to return an unfinished product is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Update:  getting my refund was a nightmare too.  That was mostly Amazon's fault.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Had high hopes. This product is very very nice looking. However I really expected more than a copy and paste type print.<br />I gave the artist and song title.<br />The print is obviously a cut and paste.<br />Just some common sense punctuation would be great.<br />Pretty much ruins it for us.
