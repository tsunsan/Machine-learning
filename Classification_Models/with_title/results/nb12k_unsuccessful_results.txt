True: 2, Predicted: 0, Text: Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Skimpy on the Product Here is a picture of how it arrived. I would expect a full bottle for the price.  It did not leak into the package and it was sealed tight.  Just not filled. It smells very nice but you cannot smell it unless you get your nose right next to it. I would really like this company to improve as I would love a diffuser to help my house smell like balsam/evergreen. I love that smell and not just at Christmas.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Photo arrived bent The picture itself is funny and that's why I bought it, when I received the product the top part of the photo was bent as if it was folded down and the picture  looked slightly blury, i didn't want the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one and possibly  having that one bent as well so I still put it in a frame and hung it up....its only my kids bathroom  so not a huge deal but you can still see the bend mark within the frame.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Breathable but not a good fit The mask material is fine and the idea of it is great, however the fit is horrid. Even if wearing it for 5 seconds the cut and fit of it is such that it slides up and pokes you in the eye. So the mask itself then is not comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of me buying this mask. If I have to keep pulling it out of my eyes it isn’t ideal to travel.

Hopefully I won't mess it up. Lesson learned! Just thought I'd share from experience.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Producer tries to save 3 cents per unit for profit and leads to sub standard product I love print design is great after that. They likely spent less than a penny on the wire that holds it against your nose, so .. there's a big gap and you might as well not wear it! .. I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..  To the producers!  spend the penny and I'll pay for it! .. sub standard products sell fewer .. you might get them by the gimmick of the American flag like me .. but I wouldn't buy it again or refer a friend .. so ..

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: TO BAD I bought this halter oct. 17 2020.  It was as close to a real halter and lead rope as possible.  chain and lobster claw as pictured on the lead rope and nice leather held its shape and real looking.  Then I ordered three more for my grand daughter. first one came the same quality.  a long time past and THANKS TO AMAZON  I did get the last two today Nov.27.  there is a big change no chain on the lead rope and no lobster claw to attach it. it has a wire twisted in it shaped in a hook to set it on the halter.  young kids will get poked by this and get hurt. the weight isnt the same in the halter as well..  both lead ropes are different in length just very poor quality.  What a shame because the first two were very nice.  Please  don't purchase these they are not the same as picture any more.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Way too short in length. What a shame. A beautiful design (even better than the photos actually) completely ruined by how short it is. I’d say it needs to be at least twice the length. They don’t tell you how long it is either so it’s sort’ve my own fault for taking a risk on it. Luckily it looks cool hanging from the rear view mirror of my Jeep. I highly recommend it for that but don’t buy it to wear. Not unless you are a frat bro d-bag with tribal tattoos, cargo shorts and a Guy Fieri hairdo. My point is, for this design, it should be a long necklace.  Last thing, it came in a very nice box…um why? It’s a necklace. We don’t need a nice box. I threw that in the trash. It’s useless. Maybe if you didn’t waste money on nice boxes you could put a few more beads on there.

I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Will give you an infection, and will turn green. When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Excellent Idea, Poorly Executed I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

As seen in the photo, the center pole was out of place, pushing the connecting pieces out of line also.<br />Then, the paint job on these is horrible. "Rustic" isn't the same thing as sloppy. This looks like a five minute paint job in someone's garage. I could've done better in my garage, honestly.<br /><br />Look, I know other options for these are are expensive but at least you'll get decent quality. And these certainly weren't cheap.

True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Awful My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 "boba" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.

It’s flimsy and doesn’t hold near as much as pictured. My husband laughed at me for getting this. If I could return this I would. I’m embarrassed that I chose it. It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Color faded quickly I was initially impressed with the design. We kept it in storage in a dark, cool area.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Quality The quality of these products are not good. Way overpriced for something that I could buy from the Dollar Tree. Pictures misleading.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE! DO NOT BUY! There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Nice but cheap My son is learning to spell his name and thought it would be a great addition to the other puzzle names.  We had purchased for our oldest child.

I thought I found a conditioner bar I’m not allergic to but it’s false advertising. Will be returning at least one. I’m very upset by this. We should be able to list our allergies so items like this can be ruled out from each of us or be able to filter out allergies. This is bs. I’m allergic to coconut and coconut derivatives.

Packaging was nice, but going back.

I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one.

I now have both of Claire's wedding bands from the show Outlander and I love them both 💜  They are both very well crafted and worth every penny.<br />UPDATE 02\17\21: I have to remove some stars from this ring, after really looking at it, this was not made by hand (as in NOT well crafted) at all, it must've been stamped by a machine because 2 out of the 3 pineapples aren't fully etched in nor are the others which I believe to be a leaf and feather maybe??  Really hard to tell.  I still wear it but wouldn't pay this much if I had seen it in person.  The other one, while not really looking like Claire's ring, is still very pretty.
True: 0, Predicted: 1, Text: Paper Thin, Very Fragile, Needs To Be Heavier To Match Cord I REALLY wanted to love this necklace, but upon opening the envelope, I was discouraged to find that the pendant was paper thin, very small and too light to even weigh down the beautiful cord that it came with.

Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!

True: 1, Predicted: 0, Text: Too much plastic wrapping!! The actual conditioner bar is ok. Nothing special, nothing terrible, but one of the main reasons I bought a conditioner bar vs a bottle at the local store was because I am trying to reduce my plastic waste. But this thing was wrapped in 3! Layers of plastic in addition to the amazon packaging. The metal tin was in a plastic bag. Sealed with plastic wrap and then inside the tin the actual bar was wrapped in plastic. So in-necessary!!

True: 1, Predicted: 2, Text: Other superior items available... These candles smell nuts in the store and we had extremely high hopes for them. So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

I ended up having to make my own to fill 7 total boxes when I was expecting this to be enough from the reviews. Unless you only put a very minimal scarce amount in a small box, you must buy multiple of these. Not worth it for this price.

True: 2, Predicted: 1, Text: Very Disappointing! I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.
