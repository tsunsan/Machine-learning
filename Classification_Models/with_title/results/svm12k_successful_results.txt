True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Beautiful But Silent It’s a beautiful piece, but does not rattle. There’s no sound at all when I shake it. Really more for looks or display than actually getting to play with it with my baby. I’m disappointed but, it’s still beautiful to look at.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Already Dying After 3 Weeks I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.

I’m not allergic to gold or surgical steel so I don’t think the piece was at all what the seller described. I would post a pic for you guys but as I was taking it off it broke, so I just tossed it. Sorry! I literally never write negative reviews but for $18 it was definitely a let down!

But it had no depth and appears willl easily fade with cleaning. I was planning even at the high price to give my family members each one for Christmas. Not now. Maybe my board is defective and if the seller sees and reads this and is willing to make me one that does not look like it was made by 5 year old then my mind could be changed. But for now I can only say do not waste your money. It is a high price rip off

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Good concept I love the idea and look. BUT, the small wooden post used to go through the ear lobe was lodged so tightly I had to put pressure on the end, resulting in it becoming splintered at the tip.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Rip Off. They obviously rely on people not reading between the lines. High quality photo means thick paper. It was put in a slightly thicker envelope. This of course bent easily. Even if it arrived unblemished it isn't worth $10. Shame on me for buying it.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Eh. . . So I guess I should have assumed this was going to be a quick fix until I find another one to replace it, but oh well. This is a small “gold” hoop that will need to be “twisted” to open and again to secure it to your piercing. I’m not a huge fan since it will not ever fully seal closed. The material is very thin (20 gauge) but because it is so small it’s a bit sharp feeling if it gets slightly tugged by my hair.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not terrible So this ring isn’t bad for the price, but it isn’t very good either. I ordered a size 10.5 ring, what I got was a ring that’s nearly 11 at one end and almost only 10 at the other end. So, the inner surface of the ring is conical (actually frustoconical). Beyond that, the coin details on the inside are half rubbed off and the exterior surface of the ring is concave from one edge to the other. This is the first one of these I’ve purchased and I’m assuming other coin rings out there are better (they appear so in the photos). Think I’ll spend more to get a better end product. Maybe larger rings are more even and flat inside and out.

Besides arriving cracked in half, the integrity was poor and not consistent with the pictures of a distinct cloud.  When placed in water, there was minimal fizzing and no distinctive colors emitted.

It made the shirt look super cheap and the only reason why I didn’t return it was because I got it the day before I actually needed and I had no other option. It works fine for a one day use. I needed it for my sons Toy Story B’Day theme. If the image was as shown It would have been a shirt I worn regularly. Very disappointing.

But now two months later the plating has almost all but rubbed off.  I will admit I didn't see the warning in the item description advising not to wear it while doing anything that might make you sweat, but I didn't wear it while working out or anything.  Just regular, casual wear and not even every day - part of my jewelry rotation of every other day or every two days or so.  It wasn't expensive but now I can't even wear something that was purchased because it had meaning for me.

I tried to contact the shop to have this error corrected — but couldn’t get past the amazon seller assistance bot.  I requested a refund and will be looking elsewhere for a print of this poem.

Didn’t have any help, so the cost of the bent up earrings is frustrating. Wouldn’t buy them again for this reason.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: 4 Stone Mother's Birthstone ring I ordered this as a Mother's Day gift from hubby  The product arrived quickly, however when I placed it on my finger it looked extremely cheap. I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.

After moving to his home after a month he was told it's a no Pitbull community. He had to bring the dog out to Maryland so his mom and dad could care for him. He is a disabled retired veteran and this dog means the world to him so I was willing to pay $85 for this bust for him. This dog looks like it has a goatee it looks like a puzzle of some sort it's absolutely horrible they kept telling you in the reviews it was so wonderful they wish they order the 23 in. I'm sorry I ordered it at all. The picture with the dark brown looks just like him in real life. That is what I thought I was buying. I hope I have learned my lesson. It makes me so sad. Pit bulls are loving and wonderful pets.

I'd like to believe this is truly 14K gold filled, but my nose got inflamed and irritated after wearing it for one night. Maybe it's 14K gold filled with some kind of plating on the outside... I don't know. I've had my nose pierced for 12 years and haven't reacted to 14K gold before, so not sure what happened here. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Reasonable for price This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not with the price Although they are pretty when viewing them on one side, regardless of which ear you put them in, they look backwards when you put them on and they are tiny. They are definitely not worth the price and look like children’s earrings. I wouldn’t have paid more than $30 for them.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality - junk go elsewhere The product is really poor quality. Just blocks of wood with adhesive letters that come from. Three arrived damaged and they were mailed so poorly that the package was ripped and blocks were sticking out. For the money the vendor charges for the product and the shipping I strongly suggest you go elsewhere or got to a craft store and do it yourself. I am disgusted.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Fell apart first use I bought this for a party . I fell in love with the design and style... HOWEVER, I wore them ONCE& with no stress the necklace fell off due to a link coming apart; my husband found the bottom of an earring in the floor;& & only 1 remains intact. Both the necklace & 1 earring are useless now. I’m so disappointed because they truly are beautiful in appearance. They were inexpensive so I didn’t expfine jewelry but for $15 ish each I expected more than 1/2 an evenings wear.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Works but not for long Very cute cozy and works well to protect the hands from heat.

This is meant to be a wedding party game and a guest signing substitute.  The design and finish were not worth the multiple efforts to have this made.  Despite the seller initially cancelling for a pricing issue without my notice, we still attempted to repurchase through the seller.<br /><br />We expected better craftsmanship and customer service than was afforded.  This is an easy wood shop design without the style or finish that was demonstrated in the photos.  Incredibly disappointing in the professional quality of this product for our intended use at our wedding. We could have made this at home ourselves.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Customize Option You need to have a customize option on all your canes that it's available on. Put it in a tab before you place your order. I love the look of this cane and in the description, it tells you that you can choose from several colors and lengths. also, either brass/gold or silver hardware. But when I went to order this item, it was just going to send the 36” walnut. It becomes a huge hassle. I noticed that you had a customize option button on another one of your canes. It fit the description of the item perfectly. This cane, and many of your others say one thing but don't offer that option. ( Even though it tells you it's available.) I would just make it simple for the customer, either change the description to one stature or put that button on all of your items that have the description offered. It would ensure the customer has some choices and received the product they truly want. Also, would save you guys time on returning messages and having returned items. This means more revenue for your bottom line with less time invested to do so. I need a 37-1/2” to 38” cane. This would hurt my back to use at 36” for a prolonged period. You make a fantastic product, change this one small thing and I myself would have purchased several of your canes alone. Thank you for your time.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Impossible to get in my ear If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Disappointed I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

An american Unisex small has always been my go to size. Not fitted, but not super loose. Enough room to fit the girls in without having them scream at you, you know?<br />I ordered a unisex Small, and I'm quite sure it is for a 12 year old boy. Some baseball moms love to have their ta-tas do the talking, I'm not that mom. Quietly melting into the background is more my style. This shirt will have any mom being the center of attention, to be sure.  Not only will your boobies look enormous, as this cheap fabric is stretched to it's breaking point, you get the added benefit of a crop top, so when you sit on those bleachers, your entire crack will be skillfully displayed to all of the curious on-lookers in the seats above you.<br /><br />Basically. Order 3 sizes up.  Or better yet, maybe don't order at all. There are no exchanges, and no prime shipping. There are plenty of other shirts just like this with better prices, better customer service and free shipping.

That was several days ago, so I am definitely not satisfied.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Doesn't work I really wanted to like this spacer, as it is a well made piece (hence the 2 stars). I like to wear multiple necklaces at a time, but they constantly get twisted together. I had been researching how to keep them from tangling and thought this spacer seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Once you manage to figure out how to place your necklaces and get them attached properly, you then have the issue of trying to close the "clasp" of the spacer back up while it is behind your neck without getting it caught in your hair. It is not easy to fasten, requiring a lot of patience and, sometimes, more time than you may have. Putting this on cannot be rushed and removing a necklace to wear separately when you are in a hurry can be difficult.<br /><br />It also doesn't stay in the back where it should. It is constantly dangling like it is one of my pendants. At least if a single chain gets turned around, the typical clasps are fairly unobtrusive, but this is spacer looks like one rather big and ugly clasp that nobody would ever want to showcase.<br /><br />Looking to wear multiple necklaces together? Don't buy this spacer. It will just cause frustration.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Awful My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 "boba" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Credit/Debit cards, Driver's license won't fit in pockets making it unusable I just received my leather wallet with custom engraving. Though I like the rustic design and rather lack of finish this has a major flaw that makes it unusable. The credit cards don't fit, it's not a thickness issue as my driver's license doesn't fit either. The pockets are not wide enough which makes me think this one wasn't made properly as the one in the picture has cards in it. If I try to force the card down I'll damage it so not sure what to do wtih this wallet now but definitely back to square one and keep searching for a wallet.

I know the description states the design/text is only on one sheet of the roll and is not a "sticker" but they sure do seem like stickers to me, whether they're "heat-pressed" or not, the price is absolutely ridiculous, or "highway robbery" like my parents used to say!  Even if the seller charged a more reasonable price (like 1/2), they'd still be making quite a profit as the price of $15.00 for one roll with heat-pressed stickers is incredibly exorbitant!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Disappointed The sizing is off, it is way too large compared to the item description about the sizing. Also, I wrote the name and bride so that they could do the initials lettering but I was disappointed when the robe came in completely wrong. They wrote out her name and put bride in really small writing. I know that mistakes can easily be made, especially with customizations so I reached out to see if they can fix this, since this is a gift and the bride will be married in less than two weeks. They were short and rude and offered me no solutions. Don’t recommend, be careful when customizing.

Highly recommend not doing business with this company due to the lack of quality and workmanship with this product. Very cheap looking quality and workmanship

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Item not as promised This was a very disappointing purchase. The colors were off and it did not look good on my nursery wall. Thr triangles were off shape from one another. It was very uneven. I was looking for navy blue and light blue which was shown in the picture and it came out as dark blue and purple which made it look a little girly for a boy’s room.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Extremely overpriced! Come on.  Look at it.  Seriously, take your time and observe it.  Scroll through each picture and slowly review each one.

Yes, you can actually build this one yourself, even if you have to rent the table saw to make the few simple cuts it will still cost you less than $100.00 to complete the project.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wouldn't purchase again Definitely not anymore breathable than a t shirt material one. Also doesn't absorb moisture, so moisture just sits on your face.

Very small I ordered the 18x12 thinking that atleast the race track would be big enough for my son's hotwheels to drive on but it's smaller then a hotwheel. I have spent $28 on a big Forrest decal that covers my entire  wall for a master bedroom then I spend $25.88 on this decal that took more time to get on the wall and it's small. Not worth the money and time to me and my son only played on it a total of one minute which I expected but it's just frustrating how hard it was to stick to my very flat wall that has litterally no waves or anything like that to prevent it from sticking. The look is aesthetically pleasing but other then that it's not really something I'm happy with throwing $25.88 at.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Defective Products The products were cheaply made. The word family was broken. Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.

I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Defective product - seller says "make  it work". I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6" tall and the other 5" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to "make it work" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.

I tried to show this in the video, and as you can see, the back/top flat is too large and slides right off. Just submitted for a return or refund. Sorry if the video is a little shaky. I am just a bit annoyed because I was really excited and relied on the other positive reviews.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: DONT BUY! I was so excited when my nose ring arrived! It came quicker than expected and was packaged very well. I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out! When I took the nose ring out I was shocked to see it so tarnished!!!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: quality is non-existent I purchased these earrings before in three other colors, simple but nice design. Since I liked it so much, decided to order it in three additional colors. The new earrings, all three, looked like they were put together in a shabby manner, looked cheap and not well made.  Like they hired someone's young cousin to do the work. While I understand that this is cheap silver jewelry, and don't expect extravagance, cheap/shabby workmanship is not something I would consider wearing. Returning all three.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Started out great, then went downhill I got these and they were going to go perfect in my son's spiderman room. I even waited a little bit to put them up because I had painted my sons room about a month prior and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause gas bubbles. So about another 3-4 weeks later I applied them. The application process was pretty straightforward and easy. They looked great on the wall. Then roughly 24hrs later, they started peeling off the wall! I tried to use the squeegee to reapply it, basically lifting the whole decal off the wall, then it started ripping as I was trying to reapply it. No matter how slow, or carefully I tried, each decal would rip in about 6+ spots. Now, 1/2 to 3/4 of each decal actually sticks to the wall and most of the bottoms are peeling off (and won't stick no matter how many times I try to get it to) and have numerous rips. Not what I was expecting at all, considering all the good reviews. Pretty disappointed, especially since these weren't cheap.<br /><br />Edit: added pictures. 1st picture showing all buildings is right after 1st time applying. Following pictures are about 24 hours later, peeling, and when gently trying to reapply they started ripping.

We don’t use it often so we didn’t notice, and now it’s too late to replace or return according to the seller.

Packaging was nice, but going back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Save yourself the frustration Never ordering from this seller again. One of the trigger pieces is too big for the slot on the blaster and no amount of sanding could fix it. Also they do not provide specific instructions on their website, they have diagrams.

The design was faulty, and the hole was too close to the top, so would not be able to hang beautifully from anything.<br /><br />After chatting with an Amazon rep, they shipped a replacement. I was expecting this to work, but nope! The second replacement had the same issue: the hole was ripped through the top, unable to hang from anything.<br /><br />Yet again, I chatted with a representative who SWORE this third time would be the charm. In case you couldn’t guess by the photo attached, the third had the same issue with the broken through hole.<br /><br />I’m SO disappointed.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I should have done more research At the end of the day, it is probably my fault I am not happy with the results.  The lettering I received was not what was pictured and even though I ordered the large font it looks tiny and “delicate” on my mailbox.  I can’t read it from the car as I approach the house.  The ordering process was not clear and there isn’t a confirmation of size/color after you place the order.  In the description they offer to send you a mock up of some sort but I didn’t see that until after the product arrived.  If what you are looking for is what is pictured, be sure to contact the seller before it ships no matter what.  Otherwise you have no idea what you are getting.

If undamaged, they were pretty enough, just too expensive for this quality.

I have used these in the past, but this one is more difficult to maneuver, especially hot.  It is also isnt glazed as others, so this one will retain flavors when cleaned.<br />The design otherwise is very pretty.<br />Update:  after cooking with them, we discovered that it ruined the taste of the food.

The paper they are wrapped in has walnut stain on it. They stink of stain and varnish. Just cheap pine unevenly stained. They rarely match.<br /><br />Although the directions show a bracket that has what appears to be about a 1/4” slot adjustment both up and down and left to right on the brackets.  The double order (8) shelves I received only had a small slot to move left or right. Not helpful since most customers might miss installing them level. Installation directions are vague to someone who is not confident. Measure twice or more.<br /><br />It might be less expensive to buy your own brackets as well as the pine and stain them yourself. As long as you’re comfortable with a router, which is what I did. These shelves are short anyway.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality leather I purchased this bag a couple of weeks ago and first I was shipped the wrong color, a replacement was shipped out only after I had to send pictures of the wrong colored bag.  The correct color arrived and I loved it until about a week into use.  The leather on the handles started to flake off, when I contracted the maker, they stated that this was vintage leather and this was common and that I could send it back to be fixed, keep in mind I have only had the bag 2 weeks!  The logo on the bag has perfect leather(shocking)!  I love supporting small business but this bag is sadly not worth the money, the design and size are great but the quality is poor.

At any rate, I left some actual pictures of what I received below, so you can be the judge.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!! I also wish that they would of offered an add-on sale of under dress shorts so I didn't spend so much time hunting down some.....right color, size, price, etc.

Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: No shine I am disappointed in these as they didn't have enough shine. They are actually a gunmetal grey color instead of silver. I tried polishing to no avail. Also the circumference of these is too small. I was hoping for the size of a quarter or maybe a little larger so that they show with long hair. I like the hammered look of these if they were just more showy and not lackluster.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not a good look in a bracelet This is a nice looking bracelet. The problem with it is that it is perfectly round and has a lot of room between the bracelet and the arm. It looks ridiculous when your arm is resting on something because the bracelet is pushed up from underneath which leaves the part on top of the wrist standing way up above the wrist. I don't like wearing it at all and neither does my niece. I do not recommend this bracelet.

First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.

Very disappointed with the tag but I can't return it so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />I ordered a different tag from this seller that came out beautiful so I know they have decent fonts/tags but this one is definitely a miss for me... a ~$14 mistake.

Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon. But then I go to ship ot and it was going to be over $190 for this $25 fake ring can be shipped back to India. Buyer be warned ⚠️!! Such a horrible experience.

If you look at the description closely, it does say 8x10, but I wish that there was an option to select specific size and corresponding price at check out so it would have been more obvious what size this was. Since I was searching for posters, I didn’t expect something this size to be described as a poster, but I guess its a lesson to check the details of an item very closely before you order.

I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is.

However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Weak magnets! Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Tabs for hanging medals are razor sharp!!! For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

The day before the wedding, we took it out of the packaging to have it ready for the wedding cake and the heart that hangs from the fishing pole had broken off at the fishing pole. We had kept it in the packaging that it had been shipped in and were gentle with it. It's absolutely adorable, but the material is not the best quality and is very fragile and frankly flimsy! If time wasn't of the essence and if it wasn't for such an important occasion I would say go for it, but if a friend asked me about the product I would tell them not to take the chance!

The colors were dull and it did not have the 3D effect like in the photo. There is a cut off line on the end of the flowers that just doesn’t look good. After getting my return shipping label it took a month to get my refund. I’m not one for writing bad reviews but I was very disappointed with this.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: FAKE I ordered this for my daughter for christmas later to find out it is completely FAKE. Instead of Peridot like the product says. It’s acctually made out of glass. So beware before perchasing that it is FAKE

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The lettering is stickers! Adorable &#34;little&#34; sign.  The lettering is stickers though.  Mine have bubbling under them.  It's slight and small but never the less, it's there. Never would I pay this much for stickers.  I will be returning it.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Don't waste your money. 1 star is being generous. I would give this product zero stars if possible.  Not only does it seem to be poorly 3d printed, but its overall junk. The plungers weren't even finished properly.<br /><br />Top that off with having to pay to return an unfinished product is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Update:  getting my refund was a nightmare too.  That was mostly Amazon's fault.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Loved it, BUT... broke in first week wearing it. I was just putting up my hair in a ponytail and it suddenly fell apart. Wish I knew sooner wouldn't last because waited awhile to wear it and now cannot return.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed, I was looking forward to the cute llama faces. There was no image on the earrings.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Waste Didn’t peel off properly a waste
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful but not how I order it. Overall this is a beautiful necklace,  but whoever did the work kinda did there own thing.  They did not use the font I choose and they did it in caps lock, which I purposely type out everything in lower case. It also was smaller than I was expecting. It’s a gift for my best friend, so I’m sure she will like it either way, but I was disappointed and bummed that it wasn’t how I ordered it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Size of a quarter.  Thrown away. Don't buy!  Cheap and too small!  The size of quarters and only one sided.  These are a perfect example of only-for-sale on the internet because NO ONE would buy them in person.  Too crappy to even go through the process of returning- just straight to the trash.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cute but doesn't stick very well! Maybe they need to invest in better laminate. Two of the 7 letters keep falling which pulls on the additional attached letters & I have to smooth them back out every couple days when I go in my daughter's room.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not so great Not sure what I was expecting here, but as this year has taught all of us; Expect the unexpected. The quality is fairly poor and not even centered on what appears to be foam board. Great idea but bot so great delivery.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Horrible horrible smell Made the mistake of unpackaging in the car- both the driver & I immediately had to unroll our windows. The smell was super toxic. If that wasn’t enough to make me return the over all quality of product was lack luster- spotty dye on the leather (tbh I didn’t even bother to unsnap- just returned ASAP).
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Came to us ripped. Came ripped at bottom.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Image is not accurate Image is very deceiving. You cannot fit a shucked raw oyster on the half shell in the wells on this plate which is what I purchased it for. Anything but the most minuscule oyster shell would be too big. Poorly designed product
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Two Stars Not worth the price
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Gold plated or spray painted? Within the first 3 weeks the " Gold plating"wore off. And I dint physically work with my hands all day. Im a construction super. Already down to the stainless and its makes it look cheap. Embarrassed to wear within a month . jeez
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Doesn't look like picture Bracelet doesn't look anything like the picture at all. Very disappointed. Bought for my grand daughter because of the color. Unable to give to her
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Holy strong These shower steamers work as they should but are so very strong it made my headache worse. I will probably try to break them and see if I can use just a tiny amount…
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Luved it but broke right away The excess string of the bracelet came out of the beads right away 😕
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not for water Turned green within day
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Looks nice at first. Looked very nice at first, but lost its shine after a short period. Not quality jewelry but you can't expect too much for the price.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It's cheap lookinh Too small. Does not look like the picture.
