True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Bridesmaids and Brides---DO NOT BUY!!! FADED/BAD PRINTING & CAME DAMAGED! DO. NOT. BUY. You've been warned!<br /><br />I am not sure where all the great reviews come from, but pictures speak a thousand words, so please see my photos. The end result looked nothing like what was advertised. As a bride-to-be, my dear friend and bridesmaid wanted to buy me this customized robe as a gift. However, it arrived with several holes across the customized portion, and these were not present on the outer organza bag that held it or the shipping, so it must have happened during production. The paintwork was also of TERRIBLE QUALITY---faded, jagged leaf edges (not in an artistic, watercolor way but clearly a bad job). If you look at my pictures, note the broken green leaves next to the pink blur that was supposed to be a pink rose and the random green dot under the rose like it came off and got stuck there. The flowers were nearly nonexistent like someone forgot to apply white ink to the fabric to give the flowers contrast. That made the lettering look weird and pretty much destroyed an otherwise gorgeous robe and color (dusty rose, by the way). The customization is supposed to enhance the robe, not destroy it.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a sweet gift from a sweet friend, but instead, I am telling her to send it back pronto so she can get her hard-earned cash back. There are many choices on Amazon---DON'T PICK THIS ONE!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Already Dying After 3 Weeks I am disappointed that after 3 weeks my mat is significantly dying. It was a little brown when it arrived and we have been misting it every day with water in addition to the water it received from daily use and has continued to die, get brown and shed all over our bathroom floor. You can see where the moss is hotglued into the mat so I don't know if that process kills it. But for the very expensive price, it should live for several years. Moss is supposed to be a very hardy plant.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful but broke an hour after wearing! The product is stunning for the price. However, for the price you get what you pay for. I bought the bracelets wear to a wedding. I didn’t even make it to the start of the ceremony before it broke.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Needs Quality Control I love the design and storage capacity of this bag, however I’m very disappointed with the damage it arrived with (see photos)<br /><br />This arrived wrapped in plastic, which the buckles had broken through. When I removed it the first thing I noticed was the right-side buckle, which hadn’t been properly aligned to its magnetic closure and appears lopsided when the bag is closed. The same buckle’s leather is also noticeably damaged where it wraps around the metal buckle, it almost looks as though it was repurposed from a used item. Strange since the right-side buckle does not have any of the same issues, it was properly aligned and has no raw edges.<br /><br />There is no need to unbuckle the bag to access the interior, if you lift the buckles it opens using only the magnetic closures. The interior is lined with a green material that feels similar to jute;  the color is not what is advertised, but since it isn’t visible I’m not bothered by it. The woven texture is already pilling, however, and if keys or something similar were to scrape against the side the lining would be easily damaged, I’m not holding out much hope for its longevity.<br /><br />The front of the bag has a long scrape down the entire length, and when turned over there are also indentations on the back. It seems when stored they were packed too tightly against each other which left damage on both sides of the bag. While I love the look of worn/vintage leather, that isn’t the effect these marks give.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this bag, and am so sad that I can’t recommend it. There is a clear lack of quality control in the production and, since it was shipped in clear plastic as its only protector, the manufacturers seem to have had every opportunity to inspect and remove this particular item and chose not to.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not good for low porosity hair Okay<br />I got this product because I was looking for a hair growth oil that has ingredients to help with itchy dry scalp, but when I put it on my hair it just weighed it down ,and it didn't do anything for my low porous hair,or itchy scalp, and I later found out that fenugreek and moringa oil would be best for someone with high porosity hair or normal hair, and not someone like me with low porosity hair. But I didn't use much of it so I'm hoping that I could find someone who has normal to high porosity hair and give it to them, because, that was no doubt the reason why this product did not work for me.<br />I hope that this review is helpful.

My board as unstained places which in no way is the grain of the wood. It is a board with 2 pieces of wood nailed on each end with 2 cheap handles. No idea how the initial and decoration was added. But it had no depth and appears willl easily fade with cleaning. I was planning even at the high price to give my family members each one for Christmas. Not now. Maybe my board is defective and if the seller sees and reads this and is willing to make me one that does not look like it was made by 5 year old then my mind could be changed. But for now I can only say do not waste your money. It is a high price rip off

I fixed mine by cutting the top edge and removing their twist tie JUNK .. and putting in a 14 gauge wire .. it's copper and still likely cost lest than 1 penny!!  Also, there is NO adjuster on the ear loops .. I fixed that by using some white electric tape .. a 1 penny bead would work best. My head is (7-1/4) and it was extremely lose without that adjustment.  Besides all that I like it ..

This is a small “gold” hoop that will need to be “twisted” to open and again to secure it to your piercing. I’m not a huge fan since it will not ever fully seal closed.

The crown looks pretty decent, but parts of the print had holes and one of the crown points is tilted in toward the body of the crown. I filled these in with hot glue. I expect it will look very good once I sand and paint it though.<br /><br />Three stars since I wasn't comfortable sanding and painting outside of the box.<br /><br />EDIT: Since my review, one of the not reinforced crown points has begun to fall off. This seems to be lower quality than I initially thought.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product at all.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Great throw - lasts 5 minutes though :( I love the description - Highly Scented!  Yeah, til you burn them.  I loved the scent of this wax melt but when I put it it the burner, I got a strong scent for five minutes and then it smelled like wax right after that.  What’s the point?  I buy a lot of wax melts but won’t be buying this brand again.

It made the shirt look super cheap and the only reason why I didn’t return it was because I got it the day before I actually needed and I had no other option. It works fine for a one day use. I needed it for my sons Toy Story B’Day theme. If the image was as shown It would have been a shirt I worn regularly. Very disappointing.

But now two months later the plating has almost all but rubbed off.  I will admit I didn't see the warning in the item description advising not to wear it while doing anything that might make you sweat, but I didn't wear it while working out or anything.  Just regular, casual wear and not even every day - part of my jewelry rotation of every other day or every two days or so.  It wasn't expensive but now I can't even wear something that was purchased because it had meaning for me.

I tried to contact the shop to have this error corrected — but couldn’t get past the amazon seller assistance bot.  I requested a refund and will be looking elsewhere for a print of this poem.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: 4 Stone Mother's Birthstone ring I ordered this as a Mother's Day gift from hubby  The product arrived quickly, however when I placed it on my finger it looked extremely cheap. I showed it to him and he thought it came out of a candy machine.<br />My ring looked nothing like the picture. The stones were spinning on a wire they were set in, the wires holding the stones in were simply wrapped around each end. It was extremely weak and could easily bend. I felt over time the stones would have eventually broken off. We were both very dissatisfied. We could not return it because it is custom made. This ring is not worth $27.<br />I certainly do not recommend this ring for any reason. It is cheaply made and looks ridiculous on the finger.

When I first got the nose ring, I fell in love with it...and then I put it in...it hurt a lot, but I figured it was because it was sore from me removing my old one and struggling to find the hole as I put the new one in. The next day, there was a huge pimple at the opening of the hole where my nose ring was. I kept it clean and waited a few days for it to go away, but it just kept getting bigger. I tried to pop the pimple and then keep it clean, and the pimple came back. A few days later, it turned green...it was easy to bend the metal after it was put into my nose, however the tattoo man who I bought a new ring from struggled to take it out to replace it with a real ring.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Really 14k? Made my skin react :( I specifically bought this because my skin reacts poorly to anything other than gold, silver or surgical steel. I'd like to believe this is truly 14K gold filled, but my nose got inflamed and irritated after wearing it for one night. Maybe it's 14K gold filled with some kind of plating on the outside... I don't know. I've had my nose pierced for 12 years and haven't reacted to 14K gold before, so not sure what happened here. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Silver hoop I really wanted to wear the small hoops to hoops and each air they’re very comfortable however to close down is difficult there was always a gap behind my ear which would snag my long hair or a sweater that I was getting into and that was a pain or hooking on a scarf I wish I never spent the money on these

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Reasonable for price This bag is made from a thin leather with a velvet-y brushed interior. The bag is overall thin and doesn’t feel super sturdy. The leather is dry and could use a conditioning out of the box. I think the straps could be better reinforced.<br />This does match the product photos and I think for the price it is reasonable. I think if this was your every day purse it would last a while, a year or so, and the straps or lining would be the first thing to go.<br />It has a weird smell to it that I don’t think will go away with time. I would save up money to buy something that will be better

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not with the price Although they are pretty when viewing them on one side, regardless of which ear you put them in, they look backwards when you put them on and they are tiny. They are definitely not worth the price and look like children’s earrings. I wouldn’t have paid more than $30 for them.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Poor quality - junk go elsewhere The product is really poor quality. Just blocks of wood with adhesive letters that come from. Three arrived damaged and they were mailed so poorly that the package was ripped and blocks were sticking out. For the money the vendor charges for the product and the shipping I strongly suggest you go elsewhere or got to a craft store and do it yourself. I am disgusted.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Alright... I Didn't realize when I chose a thread color that it would all be that color. I chose navy and even the flowers were in navy. I figured the flowers would stay pink (like in the listing picture). Also, the flowers in the picture are different (and are way better looking) than the flowers on the one I received. I also thought the hanker chief would have been more as an ivory color like in the listing picture. Mine is pure white. Still cute though I guess.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Customize Option You need to have a customize option on all your canes that it's available on. Put it in a tab before you place your order. I love the look of this cane and in the description, it tells you that you can choose from several colors and lengths. also, either brass/gold or silver hardware. But when I went to order this item, it was just going to send the 36” walnut. It becomes a huge hassle. I noticed that you had a customize option button on another one of your canes. It fit the description of the item perfectly. This cane, and many of your others say one thing but don't offer that option. ( Even though it tells you it's available.) I would just make it simple for the customer, either change the description to one stature or put that button on all of your items that have the description offered. It would ensure the customer has some choices and received the product they truly want. Also, would save you guys time on returning messages and having returned items. This means more revenue for your bottom line with less time invested to do so. I need a 37-1/2” to 38” cane. This would hurt my back to use at 36” for a prolonged period. You make a fantastic product, change this one small thing and I myself would have purchased several of your canes alone. Thank you for your time.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Impossible to get in my ear If you look at the black rainbow pair, the piece that curves that is supposed to go in your ear, and you look at the picture of the one they made mine is obviously different. they spun that tentacle so far that I cannot get it in my ear. These are supposed to be made to be able to put in easily and take out easily, they're very fragile and they seem like they're going to break trying to put them in my lobe because of the way they curve. I also ordered another one that is made differently and I will post a picture of that as well which are easier to get in my ear. Sadden cuz I loved the black ones n now cannot use them.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Disappointed I expected a beautiful bracelet with multiple shades of blue beads as was advertised in the pictures on Amazon. Instead I received a bracket with mono colored beads.  All the beads look the same, there is no variation of colors between the beads and within the beads themselves.  The pictures on line, on the advertisement show variations between the beads and within each bead.  Not what I received, very misleading!  It looks cheap and not special in any way.<br />When you contact the seller, she offers you another bracelet but does not assure you that there will be variations in bead colors in the new bracelet.  Then the seller tells you to send the old bracelet that you don't like back to her in order to issue you a refund.  Not only you have to pay $4.00 to get the item shipped to you, you will be required to ship the item back at your expense paying again for shipment. Very unhappy with the double shipment expense for an item that should have been right from the beginning and very disappointed not to have a nice bracelet!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Excellent Idea, Poorly Executed I ordered 3 sets. The grips were very poorly made. As you can see all that was done was a half inch hole drilled in the grip, filled with silicone and the concho pressed down into it. Silicone was all over the grip and plainly visible around the edge and thru the star. Looked like a 9 year old did it. I was able to fix them by getting all the dried silicone cleaned out. Laid a 1/2 inch o ring in the hole. Set the concho in and used an actual concho screw to engage from the backside. All fits perfectly now and looks good. Way it should have been done to start with. I know times are tough and things are out of hand but at the end of the day some one had to look at those shoddy grips and say "This is ok"<br />When I ordered someone had to package the grips and mail them.<br />That person must have also said "This is ok"  Well it wasnt "OK" Basically This is a 12 dollar set of grips messed up by the concho install and then charged 40 bucks for them. I was able to make them nice but took me well over an hour of work  just to have the grips be remotely usable.  I DO NOT recommend.

This is flimsy and just....junk. Tacky. Looks just tacky. and then I put it up and it ripped. Just great. Asking for full refund. Honestly, beware. look elsewhere. expensive and just awful experience.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Chain is Sterling Silver, ball chime is not! Beautiful Sterling Silver chain but the main feature of this necklace, the Harmony Ball, is NOT Sterling Silver.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not Unisex sizing Absolutely purchase this T shirt if you are a size 00. It is darling, to be sure. But Unisex sizing? No way.  An american Unisex small has always been my go to size. Not fitted, but not super loose. Enough room to fit the girls in without having them scream at you, you know?<br />I ordered a unisex Small, and I'm quite sure it is for a 12 year old boy. Some baseball moms love to have their ta-tas do the talking, I'm not that mom. Quietly melting into the background is more my style. This shirt will have any mom being the center of attention, to be sure.  Not only will your boobies look enormous, as this cheap fabric is stretched to it's breaking point, you get the added benefit of a crop top, so when you sit on those bleachers, your entire crack will be skillfully displayed to all of the curious on-lookers in the seats above you.<br /><br />Basically. Order 3 sizes up.  Or better yet, maybe don't order at all. There are no exchanges, and no prime shipping. There are plenty of other shirts just like this with better prices, better customer service and free shipping.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Awful My young daughter bought this (very expensive almost $25-30) slime with her own money after seeing it on a YouTube video- she had to have it.  She was so excited for this slime she patiently waited and looked for it in the mail every single day. It took weeks for it to arrive, and It arrived over a week later than we were told/it was expected. It has 5 "boba" balls which are basically just some hard plastic beads and it quite literally looks like lumpy vomit or poo. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo. I'm all for supporting small businesses and understand things can happen with shipping sometimes etc. I could have gotten past the delay if this slime was as pictured, however, this slime was not worth the wait and now I will have to find an alternative slime to make it up to my daughter. I'm assuming we will be out about $60 total (on a slime!!) when said and done. Not happy. This experience/slime was disappointing from start to finish.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Credit/Debit cards, Driver's license won't fit in pockets making it unusable I just received my leather wallet with custom engraving. Though I like the rustic design and rather lack of finish this has a major flaw that makes it unusable. The credit cards don't fit, it's not a thickness issue as my driver's license doesn't fit either. The pockets are not wide enough which makes me think this one wasn't made properly as the one in the picture has cards in it. If I try to force the card down I'll damage it so not sure what to do wtih this wallet now but definitely back to square one and keep searching for a wallet.

I know the description states the design/text is only on one sheet of the roll and is not a "sticker" but they sure do seem like stickers to me, whether they're "heat-pressed" or not, the price is absolutely ridiculous, or "highway robbery" like my parents used to say!  Even if the seller charged a more reasonable price (like 1/2), they'd still be making quite a profit as the price of $15.00 for one roll with heat-pressed stickers is incredibly exorbitant!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very disappointed. I ordered from  Country barn babe because  all the reviews were great and all five stars. I guess I didn't have as good a luck. Very disappointed in the way I received my recipe box.  Understand there is imperfections in wood sometimes but I guess I expected a lot more. The box has a very dull finish and although I do normally like the rustic look, this did not look very nice. Christmas is four days away so I guess I'm going to have to try to put a coat of varnish and try to put more stain on the light spots.It looks they did a rush job because of the holiday.

Great idea which is why I purchased them. In reality, the sent of these wax melts is so faint I can barely smell them when I stick my nose right up to the was warmer. Even then, the vapor rub smell is ineffective. I hope this vendor will work to improve the product but until such time as that happens, it's not worth purchasing.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Disappointed The sizing is off, it is way too large compared to the item description about the sizing. Also, I wrote the name and bride so that they could do the initials lettering but I was disappointed when the robe came in completely wrong. They wrote out her name and put bride in really small writing. I know that mistakes can easily be made, especially with customizations so I reached out to see if they can fix this, since this is a gift and the bride will be married in less than two weeks. They were short and rude and offered me no solutions. Don’t recommend, be careful when customizing.

I was very disappointed.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Good luck with keeping the backs on I did like these little studs but I was skeptical about the backs.  Turns out I had good reason, I lost the 3mm stud and back along with the 4mm stud and back two times. By some miracle I found the 4mm and back in the bathtub.  Now I have lost the back to the other 4mm stud.  The backs are little pieces of plastic that seem to loosen easily, they are clear and impossible to find.  For this reason I would not recommend to a friend.

Very small I ordered the 18x12 thinking that atleast the race track would be big enough for my son's hotwheels to drive on but it's smaller then a hotwheel. I have spent $28 on a big Forrest decal that covers my entire  wall for a master bedroom then I spend $25.88 on this decal that took more time to get on the wall and it's small. Not worth the money and time to me and my son only played on it a total of one minute which I expected but it's just frustrating how hard it was to stick to my very flat wall that has litterally no waves or anything like that to prevent it from sticking. The look is aesthetically pleasing but other then that it's not really something I'm happy with throwing $25.88 at.

Doggies was spelled doogies, several tiles were not the same size, 2 Velcro’s were sent for each tile. Even the 7 inch tile had 2 Velcro’s. I contacted the seller and was advised that this could not be true because no one has “complained” in the 15 years they have been in business. I beg to differ. I sent the picture. No response. Shipping took forever and the tape used to make the letters is cheap. I am very very disappointed because this was going to be part of my virtual Thanksgiving background.<br /><br />The resolution offered was to ship everything back and start over. But why? The seller did not listen to my request and instead, defended the business even though I have pictures.<br /><br />The service COULD have been great if they would have offered to replace the defective items and close the case. Now, I have no use for the product because I will not have time to get the situation corrected. Very disappointing.

I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back.

It’s a piece if leather folded then two slots cut for two credit cards. The part for cash doesn’t have an extra piece of leather to hold it in place. He thought it looked like something a kid made. My husband threw it in the bottom drawer and giggled. Not worth the price. One star because I can’t not rate it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Defective product - seller says "make  it work". I ordered 2 mug cozies.  When the pair arrived I noticed one was much larger than the other.  Neither were useable as both were too large for the mug.  I tried to return them but the seller refused stating that they were custom made for my mugs.  Upon my mentioning that the pair was 2 different sizes, she told me that was because my color choice included one with thicker yarn. When I ordered, she requested me to give her the exact measurements of my mug.  It states right in her ad that the cozies fit snugly and stretch.  I don't understand why she made one almost 6" tall and the other 5" tall when the mug itself is only 4.75" tall. If you want to drink out of your mug, the cozy has to be shorter than the mug.  They are also very loose.  Sadly, she informed me to "make it work" or place another order for a 25% discount.  Neither of which was acceptable to me.  Finally after repeatedly trying to return the items and the sellers refusal, Amazon credited my account.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Iaco Iusday This bracelet was very poorly stamped.  I love the weight and fit, but what is a laco?  With the way the T is stamped in the word, it makes it look like a lowercase L or uppercase I because the stamping is not centered and the cross of the T blends into the edge of the bracelet.  I love buying handmade because of the uniqueness of every piece, and I’ve sold jewelry for years (beaded, not stamped). If I tried to give one of my customers something like this, I would be embarrassed.  The impressions aren’t as deep as shown in the photo, but that doesn’t bother me as much.  So disappointed.  Will return.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE! DO NOT BUY! There are MANY people who struggle with these things every day, and there are a plethora of medical conditions (almost any chronic illness, ADHD, autism) that make these things extraordinarily difficult. Framing them as requiring "no effort" is flat incorrect and profoundly dismissive of the challenges that many people have. It's basically a sign showing that you have a 1) profound lack of judgment to display something this offensive and 2) a shocking lack of empathy to understand that MANY people struggle with these things due to disabling illnesses and more that are NOT in their control.<br /><br />For people who say this is great for motivating a team, telling people their struggles aren't real isn't "motivating", it is SHAMING THEM, for things that may very well not be in their control. And shame actually UNDERMINES performance.<br /><br />For people who are saying they'd post this in a workplace, you are likely driving away both customers and employees (not to mention that you are basically advertising yourself as someone who doesn't provide accommodations for disabilities). I know I would walk right out the door of any business with an offensive and ableist sign like this on display - I wouldn't work in such an office, nor would I buy products/services for them, and I am not alone in this. There are plenty of other commenters that similarly find this extremely offensive.<br /><br />Yikes. Just yikes. Please do better.

I’m sensitive to metals so 925 sterling silver has always been okay... Then everything went wrong after I put the jewelry in. My first thought was that the metal was very soft. Within a few hours I noticed redness around my piercing, 6-8 hours later I had a puss filled bump on top of my piercing. After that i was in pain and the nose ring had to come out!

The sad part is that after carefully washing them one time the letters and the tails were peeling off. It is sad because we were wanting to them for 3 different occassions, one being her birthday. If quality on the lettering could be fixed, then this is a great product. Or if you need it only one time it is a great product.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Started out great, then went downhill I got these and they were going to go perfect in my son's spiderman room. I even waited a little bit to put them up because I had painted my sons room about a month prior and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause gas bubbles. So about another 3-4 weeks later I applied them. The application process was pretty straightforward and easy. They looked great on the wall. Then roughly 24hrs later, they started peeling off the wall! I tried to use the squeegee to reapply it, basically lifting the whole decal off the wall, then it started ripping as I was trying to reapply it. No matter how slow, or carefully I tried, each decal would rip in about 6+ spots. Now, 1/2 to 3/4 of each decal actually sticks to the wall and most of the bottoms are peeling off (and won't stick no matter how many times I try to get it to) and have numerous rips. Not what I was expecting at all, considering all the good reviews. Pretty disappointed, especially since these weren't cheap.<br /><br />Edit: added pictures. 1st picture showing all buildings is right after 1st time applying. Following pictures are about 24 hours later, peeling, and when gently trying to reapply they started ripping.

We don’t use it often so we didn’t notice, and now it’s too late to replace or return according to the seller.

Packaging was nice, but going back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not worth the time or the money So I ordered this on May 23rd and just got it on June 20th it was $80 that wasn't worth it, if you look at the pictures the edges are uneven not straight with the plexy glass at all and the penmanship for the customization is really faint. I spent $80 on a product that was just slapped together and took a month to get, I have to keep it because I am getting married next month and don't have time to make or order a different one. Very disappointed not even with 1 star.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Save yourself the frustration Never ordering from this seller again.

I was expecting this to work, but nope! The second replacement had the same issue: the hole was ripped through the top, unable to hang from anything.<br /><br />Yet again, I chatted with a representative who SWORE this third time would be the charm. In case you couldn’t guess by the photo attached, the third had the same issue with the broken through hole.<br /><br />I’m SO disappointed.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I should have done more research At the end of the day, it is probably my fault I am not happy with the results.  The lettering I received was not what was pictured and even though I ordered the large font it looks tiny and “delicate” on my mailbox.  I can’t read it from the car as I approach the house.  The ordering process was not clear and there isn’t a confirmation of size/color after you place the order.  In the description they offer to send you a mock up of some sort but I didn’t see that until after the product arrived.  If what you are looking for is what is pictured, be sure to contact the seller before it ships no matter what.  Otherwise you have no idea what you are getting.

I have used these in the past, but this one is more difficult to maneuver, especially hot.  It is also isnt glazed as others, so this one will retain flavors when cleaned.<br />The design otherwise is very pretty.<br />Update:  after cooking with them, we discovered that it ruined the taste of the food.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Broken garbage. DO NOT BUY This plate is extremely disappointing. I bought this for my mom who is a HUGE star wars fan. The picture is extremely misleading.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Poor quality leather I purchased this bag a couple of weeks ago and first I was shipped the wrong color, a replacement was shipped out only after I had to send pictures of the wrong colored bag.  The correct color arrived and I loved it until about a week into use.  The leather on the handles started to flake off, when I contracted the maker, they stated that this was vintage leather and this was common and that I could send it back to be fixed, keep in mind I have only had the bag 2 weeks!  The logo on the bag has perfect leather(shocking)!  I love supporting small business but this bag is sadly not worth the money, the design and size are great but the quality is poor.

It didn't look like an "F" I was really sad and disappointed bc I always look forward to getting the grandkids their bday outfits. The cuteness of the dress was taken away by the "F" letter!!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: The nose ring delivered to you is not at all the nose ring presented on the sellers page. Although very pretty, I was deeply disappointed when I received my order because it did not appear on the sellers page to be as cheap as it is when you receive the order! I honestly haven't even used it because it's cheap costume jewelry in my opinion and I've been getting body piercings done for 18 years and counting.. I've boughten and have seen just about all there is on the market. I feel like my opinion is a valid one. Although my skin isn't sensitive to fake costume jewelry, I've never bother to put cheap body jewelry in my piercings!

Two different sizes were ordered 12 month and 18 month. The 12 month shirt came on BIGGER than the 18 month shirt. The 12 month shirt fits my little man well. So, my issue is with the 18 month shirt (Jaxson). Also, in the middle of the Dino the vinyl is bunched on the 18 month shirt. I put the 18 month shirt on my son and it is very “fitted” and short on him so this will not work. The shirts are thin and cheap but the print is cute and was what I was wanting for their birthday....

So good in fact you probably want a cologne with some of the scents or your house to have their scents permanently embedded in them.  HOWEVER.  when burning they do not smell at all. I've tried 2 of them over this holiday weekend, burning for a few hours each.  Maybe a 5&#34; radius around the candle if your lucky smells good. No where near a room filling ability.  I bought 3 of these candles for $60.  I know, I know, but we are candle sluts.  Very disappointed in this product.  Other brands that we find at niche stores or discount stores with unique scents like  whiskey, suede/leather, tobacco, etc, for half the price blow these away.  Be forewarned.

I don't like wearing it at all and neither does my niece. I do not recommend this bracelet.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Eh I am rating this two stars for numerous reasons. First, I ordered these back in late May, they were supposed to arrive around the 20th of August, and I didn’t receive them until the first week of June. When I contacted the seller, I was never written back which just made me feel scammed. Secondly, as you can see the In the first picture they are cut crooked, and are quite more flimsy than anticipated. Then, as I have had these for maybe a week now, you will notice in the last two photos one is already begin to peel, and I haven’t even used it to hang anything up yet. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because the prints are cute.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: This is a piece of paper you are buying, not an album! So, just to let everyone know, this is not an album. This is a framed piece of paper with the customizations on the paper the customer wants.<br />My issues: Although, it does say it is a piece of paper in the product description, for $50 you'd expect something with a little wow factor. Upon seeing the product up close, it became apparent to me this was not worth $50. I requested a refund. The seller wanted me to pay the shipping cost of the product stating, "We have no hopes of resell on this:)  Once the frame is received back, a full refund will be issued." Re-sale what...? The piece of paper? It's a piece of paper! This frame from Walmart isn't worth $50 either. I'm just letting anyone who might look at this know what you are getting. It a customized piece of paper in a Walmart frame for $50. Yes, the seller will refund your money, after you pay them to ship it back. Be aware.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not the best quality! The concept for the bracelet is so cute, but the positive ends there. I thought the world be a great addition to my alex and Ani collection.<br />The fit is poor and the charms are too light weight and not of good quality. This might be cute to give to a child but I don’t think it is good for an adult. I love the wizard of oz, as it is to late to return I will have to find someone to give it to.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Too expensive to be so cheaply made Looks cool with the lights sitting on the shelf.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Be VERY careful what font you pick! I love the shiny brass of the tag since so many tags are all silver which made me happy to find a "gold" one. HOWEVER, I WISH the seller would include the entire alphabet in each font (upper and lower case) so that we'd be able to pick the right font when spending so much money on a specially made tag.<br /><br />Showing us examples of the fonts with 3 letter names like Max or even a longer name like Bella however those examples don't help any of us with dogs that have longer/different names or help us decide if we want the tag in all uppercase or a mix.<br /><br />I wish that the seller would either show us the entire alphabet of fonts OR make it so we'd get an actual previews of what the tag would look like in each font BEFORE ordering that way we get exactly what we want especially for these tags that cost pretty much the same as the ones in the pet stores do that actually show you exactly what you're getting.<br /><br />I would have never ordered this tag in this font if they would have shown the different fonts completely and clearly. Very disappointed with the tag but I can't return it so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />I ordered a different tag from this seller that came out beautiful so I know they have decent fonts/tags but this one is definitely a miss for me... a ~$14 mistake.

Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Double check size before ordering I can say that some of this was in me for not looking VERY closely at size, but I was a little disappointed when this arrived and it was an 8x10 photo. I was wanting something more poster size. If you look at the description closely, it does say 8x10, but I wish that there was an option to select specific size and corresponding price at check out so it would have been more obvious what size this was. Since I was searching for posters, I didn’t expect something this size to be described as a poster, but I guess its a lesson to check the details of an item very closely before you order.

However, for the price of this pendant (regardless of the necklace it's on, that's a cheap item any of us can buy or find), the pendant itself is ridiculously small. I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is. Aside from that it's a beautiful piece.

BUT, I had the bracelet personalized and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is UPSIDE DOWN. The personalization text one the outside of the bracelet is facing one direction and the personalization text on the inside of the bracelet is facing the opposite direction which is definitely a deal breaker for me.

Be careful what you place on it because it may tip.  Also, the nail holes are visible ALL OVER the table - they didn't even attempt to cover or paint over them, so it looks very poorly put together.  After I received it, I went back and looked at the pictures online and those also showed all of the nail holes. I wish I had looked more closely at the pictures and reviews before buying  ALOT of money for something so poorly put together.  Will not buy from this seller again.

A cheap looking silver dangling clasp which is not displayed  with thread showing through  appears to be holding these so called real stones together. Very disappointing and will return. Just received 10 minutes ago.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Personally not what I was looking for in a bag for nursing school... Don’t buy the organizer you can get it for $2.40 from amazon. I thought the organizer they are selling was big enough to go the width of the bag so I bought it. I should have read the details a little better. It (the organizer) is REALLY small, books will not fit in it. (Especially not any of my nursing books!) When I got the bag the monogram already had a couple pulls in the thread in my first initial, not super noticeable, I just hope it doesn’t unravel. Personally just not what I was hoping for to use during nursing school.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Garbage. Not worth any price. Firstly, 21oz size is an outright lie. Without ice it holds under 12ozs. Handle is made of plastic and poorly attached. "Personalization" is a sticker that will quickly be destroyed by any moisture. Garbage.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Shipped item back, no refund This necklace was beautiful, but I had an allergic reaction to it. The seller was kind enough to offer a refund. However, I paid to ship the necklace back. They claim they never received it and will not issue a refund. So I paid for the necklace, additional pendants and return shipping and have nothing to show for it. Overall, very poor experience.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Weak magnets! Nice idea, but poorly executed.  The magnets are too weak!  I’ve used these for less than two days, and one of the backing magnets has already detached and gone missing (I was pulling my needlework out of the bag it was in, the bobbin part caught, and the backing magnet went bye bye).  Debating whether to buy stronger magnets, or just return these.  I’m using a Readerest Magnetic Eyeglass Holder for keeping my needles from getting lost; it has stayed firmly attached for over a month, and is still going strong.  In fact, maybe I’ll try using a Readerrest Back to attach the bobbin, and see if that will work for me.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not decor or sign. This is not decoration or signage. It’s literally a print…a print on magazine quality backing. I feel dumb.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Bad Coloring The flag colors were faded blue and a pinkish orange red. Not traditional flag coloring at all, very disrespectful to all those who serve.  Advertised as vibrant red white and blue. The personalization was correct but the shadowing and lettering were not good. This was for our son’s party for leaving for Basic Training. Very disappointed with not enough time to find a replacement.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice but cheap My son is learning to spell his name and thought it would be a great addition to the other puzzle names.  We had purchased for our oldest child.  This one doesn't even compare to the quality of our other wooden puzzle name boards.  It's super thin and lightweight, but the bright colors are pretty.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Tabs for hanging medals are razor sharp!!! For most of their products having a 'sharp metal edge' is ok once it is mounted. BUT, for the tabs that need to be pulled away from the wall so your children/adults can hang a new award medal this can be very dangerous. These edges need to be rounded. The Rusted Orange factory said just be careful, we can't be bothered to round the edges. (which is necessary to prevent cuts on children's fingers). Don't buy this particular product. It would take only a few minutes for them to further process these tabs to be rounded. Looks like I will try to file down the edges and try not to cut myself.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wrong size listed in description Let the buyer beware! This purse is NOT the size stated in the description. The one I received was 9 inches wide by 7 1/2 inches tall (about 23 cm by 19 cm). The size described was 10 inches (25 cm) by 14 inches (35 cm). So I was expecting a larger size purse than this.<br />Other than that it is a pretty purse.<br />Please adjust your description of this item!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Arrived damaged/chipped. This is a gorgeous shoe rack, but I am really disappointed that one of the pieces of wood arrived chipped/damaged (see pictures).

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: I checked it when it arrived and it everything looked fine. The day before the wedding We bought this custom made for my daughter's wedding back in April. I checked it when it arrived and it everything looked fine. The day before the wedding, we took it out of the packaging to have it ready for the wedding cake and the heart that hangs from the fishing pole had broken off at the fishing pole. We had kept it in the packaging that it had been shipped in and were gentle with it. It's absolutely adorable, but the material is not the best quality and is very fragile and frankly flimsy! If time wasn't of the essence and if it wasn't for such an important occasion I would say go for it, but if a friend asked me about the product I would tell them not to take the chance!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Very Disappointing! I bought this table from another vendor (same price) and wow I am so incredibly disappointed. The top looks nothing like the image here but moreso something I could make myself from old, weathered pallets. There is no finish at all and looks like it was quickly thrown together and sanded before shipping. And more sanding will be needed so my young children don’t get splinters because the top is still quite rough - not at all what you would expect for a coffee table surface. The nails are visible in the top and there’s one on the side of the top that is protruding and will need to be sanded down so as to not scratch or cut someone. I’ve written the vendor to see what I can do to return the table. I was so excited to find a real reclaimed wood table that wasn’t 400 dollars but too good to be true.

Definitely RETURNING!!! 😡<br />Update:<br />The seller was incredibly rude, and first refused a refund. Than gave me a shipping slip un paid for to return it after I reported them to Amazon. But then I go to ship ot and it was going to be over $190 for this $25 fake ring can be shipped back to India. Buyer be warned ⚠️!! Such a horrible experience.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Bad quality I was very unhappy with this, for one it was very expensive and when I received this it didn’t look like the photo. The colors were dull and it did not have the 3D effect like in the photo. There is a cut off line on the end of the flowers that just doesn’t look good. After getting my return shipping label it took a month to get my refund. I’m not one for writing bad reviews but I was very disappointed with this.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Literally fell apart the first time I picked it up I bought this as a gift, fortunately it came early. One of the boards that the handles are attached to pulled completely off and the other one became loose the very first time I picked this up, there was nothing on it even. The boards are simply nailed with an air nailer from the bottom. I had to  pull the nails out, and then I used wood glue and new nails to reassemble the piece. For the price of this thing the least the builder could do is use 25 cents worth of wood glue along with the nails.

My excitement evaporated when I received it.  What a disappointment for two big reasons: the size of the shirt and the quality of the characters on the shirt.  I ordered a large which fit like medium.  The shirt is 100% cotton, and it's not preshrunk. It's NOT going to fit when I wash it.  Second, and more importantly, Calvin and Hobbes are blurry, and it looks like the characters will peel after a few washes. BUMMMER!!!!!!!!

The strap is so thin that you cannot wear it with a watch and look normal. I will post pictures. When I requested a return the seller says I have to pay for shipping. I haven't used this thing and I am having to pay 10% to return this defective item? It is roughly half the thickness shown in the pictures. Maybe even less.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Wanted to love it but... I've always wanted a world map with pins. This one is beautiful, but there are some things I'd caution buyers about.  Some of the pieces are not very well made. For instance, once I'd put the pin in the UK piece, it broke :(  Next, it's not very easy to assemble, especially on the floor. And once you put it on the wall, forget about trying to get it off again to make any adjustments...the pieces will break if you try to remove them from the wall. Also, double check your flags....some flags were wrong on mine (such as Peru) and some flags were in the wrong place (for me, the Saudi Arabia flag was in the place of Russia's flag). Google ALL flags before pinning them on your wall if you aren't 100% confident that you know the country's flag. I won't be returning mine because, as I said, it's difficult to remove it from the wall and I paid a lot of money for it...easier to just leave it as it is at this point.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Wording is way too light I purchased these in the rose gold color as a gift for my friends for our upcoming Vegas girls weekend. The wording is so light that in normal lighting you can’t even see whose cup is whose. Unfortunately I was not granted the opportunity to exchange it for ones with more contrast. The rose gold tone was a complete fail, and sadly the shop owner knew that as she stated in an email to me that the contrast is very light in the rose gold color.  It would have been nice knowing that before I spent that much money. Perhaps add that to the description. Lesson learned. Other than that they would be very cute in another color.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Didn't hold up for 2 days of use I received this on Saturday and on Monday, I got it ready for work. Wallet, some pens, a small notebook and my phone. Wore it to work. Received nice comments on it. Repeated on Wednesday.<br /><br />Thursday morning, after approximately having used the bag very lightly for 16 total hours, most of that sitting on a desk, I go to leave the house with it and notice 3 puncture holes on the front. I panic at perceieved damage before realizing the buckle has come off. I look everywhere but can't find it. Depressed because a bag I like lacks quality, I file for a return.<br /><br />I get into the car and find the buckle on the floor. It was apparently held on by 3 very small prongs, which are now just slightly open, meaning it fell off from shifting and wasn't due to handling. I consider fixing it, but after re-examining the bag, there is no way to get up against the area where the prongs will go to reseat them from the inside.<br /><br />Then it makes me wonder what will happen if I put actual weight in the bag. Right now, it is super stiff, so even full, there wouldn't be much pressure exuded on the straps, but when it begins to loosen and become slack, those little tiny prongs aren't going to hold things safely closed.<br /><br />I was really wanting to like this bag. I have had it on my list for ages...blah.<br /><br />By the way, a 15.6" laptop barely fits, and with a sleeve, there is basically no way to close the flap, hence my using it as a purse. On top of that, it is so stiff, and has very little lining, that one would probably not feel comfortable without a padded sleeve.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Silver setting is not well fitted to the pear shaped stones I ordered these in late September as a holiday gift. They appeared fine in the clear plastic box. But when the earrings were taken out, I found the setting did not seem to fit the stones well. There are gaps between the stone and its silver setting in places, and one of the earrings has a small bend in the setting at about 10 o'clock as seen in the first photo.  I clicked on return, and then return to seller, but received an automatic notice that the return period has expired.  I was hoping to avoid holiday rush backlog by ordering early.  The stone is nice although heavier and the profile is higher than expected. But the silver setting is poorly formed, at least in my opinion.

As a matter of precaution, I hand-washed the Beanie to remove any harmful chemicals that might be coating this product. I put the Beanie on and it barely fit my head. Then when I wore it on a cold day, the wind went right through the loose weave on the Beanie. I'm severely disappointed with this product and would warn people about these issues.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Bent items and off center work It's one thing to be handmade. It's another to just be sloppy. These were an embarrassment to give to my husband for our anniversary. Luckily he's a great guy and just laughed it off, but what a disappointment. The monogram isn't even close to being centered and both the money clip and tie clip are bent out of shape a little, so the don't line up

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Completely disappointed Kept the pits perfumed and odorized for a max two hours before fading; and this occurred 24/7. Not to mention the something-wood scent was not even strong and satisfying. Have a second thought before spending your money on the wood-scented one, maybe the lavender would be different. Total ripoff.

The monogram is very small and the ink is faint.  Even the card stock is on the thin side.  I would not purchase this item again and will probably return it.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Do not buy this. Poor quality and  Returning it is impossible. This sweatshirt is absolute garbage. It is thin, poor quality and the graphic on the sweatshirt was crooked and bled onto other parts of the sweatshirt as if it was folded up before it was dry..And on top of that the return policy is such a hassle I am just going to keep it anyway. Also.. if you DO decide To deal with returning it they charge a 20% fee.

I thought that the crystal would be the same size as it is shown on picture and it  is really small. I bought this to give as a present and was unable to give it as it was not suitable. The crystal is very clear and brilliant but too small for anyone to even notice. The chain was very nice though.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Volume & Power buttons disabled This is a 3rd party seller (Not Amazon). The case impedes the volume and power buttons from working properly.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Too small These are quite small rings. I wouldn't recommend for your nostril. I bought these because I have one nostril pierced and I'm toying with getting the other one pierced too. These are too small to reach to the same height on my nose that my other piercing sits at. They are very pliable but it doesn't work for me.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cheap iron on patch There are ZERO 4 or 5 star reviews, see for yourself click on one......From the looks of the mask on Amazon the squirrel appears to be sewn or embroidered in....it’s not. It’s a small squirrel iron on patch that’s been ironed onto a cheap flat fabric mask.  The squirrel s already coming unglued on the outside. Mask has no nose clip and no contoured chin. There is no filter pocket either. The mask is NOT adjustable at the ears so whatever the fit is it’s the best you’re going to get.... pretty sad really In my opinion it’s not worth the $14.95 total including shipping<br />Side note, there are no 5 or 4 star reviews, yet they show the 5 star at 55%....something isn’t right about that

If it’s hand made it should be easy to make it like the picture. Don’t get me wrong it’s nice and fit right but smh. What a disappointment that was. All that waiting time and money for me to flatten it out myself or pay more for someone else to do it.

Hopefully, they'll send the correct size soon.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Doesn't fit over my bird's head Collar does not fit over our bird's head. We tried several angles.  Pity because it is a nice collar and I like that it is not rigid.  Due to my own life/health issues we were not able to try putting the collar on our bird until after the window of return closed.  I may try cutting the opening wider on this one and see if that makes the opening big enough to get over his head. If you order one, measure your birds head/beak and contact seller to confirm fit

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: So small These are great quality.  But it's obviously for NOT for anyone with medium or large wrists. I was fooled by the pictures.  I thought the bracelets were thicker and just more substantial than what they actually are. Measure your wrists before purchase, and don't expect the bracelets to be like the pic.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Do not buy this Nope. The word handmade is very misleading. This is a literal photocopy of something that someone may have made. It's is printed on photo paper.

I don't know whether they sent me the wrong product or what, but the only way this works as a leave-in conditioner is if you don't mind being an oil slick and looking slimey.

Avoid at all costs unless you want to look like a greaser from the 50s.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Buyer Beware! Poor Quality!! I was very dissatisfied! Poor Quality ring base. Stone looked to be manufactured. The inclusions were more like plastic chips then organic debris. The stone was loose in the setting. Being a third party the normally straight forward Amazon return policy does not apply.<br />The seller accepted the return of sent to Istanbul Turkey at my expense. This would have cost me more than half the price of the Ring itself. I saw this stipulation nowhere in the ad for this item.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: No Scent & Gritty What a disappointment. There is a very slight hint of honeysuckle which dissipates the moment you put the powder on. The packaging is a disaster as the minute you take the top off, powder goes everywhere (and it has an unpleasant chalky feel). Lastly, it doesn't absorb moisture which is the main purpose of dusting powder.

I can't put this in a frame since the frame would cut off the letter.  This was to be a gift but I would be embarrassed to give it to someone.

They push together easy enough but I didn't realize how annoying it would be without a clasp because I'm always worried they are going to fall out or get stuck in my holes.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Doesn't stick to ALL types of Walls Overall, my daughters name came out perfect!! I was so excited to have this sticker on my daughters wall. However, when trying to place it on her wall it didn't stick at all. This ONLY works with flat wall that doesn't have any type of texture to it. I returned it within a week, it's been two months and I still haven't received my refund. I've sent several messages asking about my refund and I haven't received a response back. Really bad customer service. PLEASE don't purchase if your wall has texture to it. It will NOT stick.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Way smaller than expected did not fit expected area Them is flexible but way too small to put in ear maybe for a baby but not an adult
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Will tarnish I loved these when they first arrived, but after just two weeks of wear, they were so badly tarnished that a silver polish cloth wouldn't remove the tarnish. When I contacted the seller, she recommended cleaning them every time I wear them and keeping them in a sealed plastic bag when I wasn't wearing them, but the tarnish is so bad they're unwearable. Though I'd asked for a refund or replacement, she ignored those questions. Buyer beware.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth buying. The Name beads fell off and the Names on Beads rubbed off within 2 Days. The clasp doesn't stay closed, so my Husband stopped wearing it because he would lose it due to falling (clasp doesn't hold) off several times a Day

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not the best nose ring purchase. Would make a better ear ring or something else. The ball and opal already fell off.  Offer only about a week. It still has one left but that isn’t why I purchased it. And it doesn’t close properly hence why they fell off to begin with which pinches the inside of your nose constantly.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: It’s literally just a piece of paper. I truly wouldn’t waste ur money like I did. Maybe I mis read the reviews but I thought this was supposed to be a poster like quality or on canvas. It’s literally a piece of paper that I could have printed at home on glossy paper. I was so disappointed to give this as a gift. Thankfully she loved it anyway because I thought of her so there’s that.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Low gauge paper Great design but was surprised when I received them that they were just printed on a slightly higher gauge of paper than what you use in your printer day today.  Would suggest a more sunstantial/stiffer material to resemble more what is placed on the doors at hotels.

Apparently it needs to be added when customizing.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Visible knot, little color Disappointed. Ordered for a gift and was not going to open the package but am glad I did. The knot is visible and and too big to hide inside a bead. Not sure yet if I will try to cover the knot with a bead or send it back. Also, there is very little color variation in the tiger's eye so this is about 90% black (boring).

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not "Natural Free Shape " Bought the ring for my fiance because it was advertised as natural free shape and she loves natural shaped pearls. Once recieved, the ring looks almost perfectly round, not even close to the natural shape shown in the picture.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: D20 Dragon Pendant *UPDATE* After I gave this to my friend, she went two days and one of the horns fell off according to her. She wears pendants and such quite often so I don't think it was a matter of carelessness on her part. I haven't seen how broken the piece is but when it's a gift that breaks after just two days, it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift and I must say the customization in colors and design are great. I love the selection that's available and it really helps to make it a unique gift. At first I didn't know if it would be too big, since I've seen some 20 sided die that are huge, but it's a perfect size to display the dragon and die without being too heavy. Awesome work, you rolled a 20

Amazon delivers it and I'm looking for a  very small box, at least,  and a box I did receive if it's the size of a FedEx overnight envelope!!! I opened it and the the 3 pictures were like the flimsy 8x10's that come in the 20 dollar elementary school portrait package from back in the Dinosaur era.  I giggled uncontrollably, for a few at my misfortune and politely sealed the envelope back up and placed in the spring cleaning in the summer box!!!

The look of them is very vintage, but in the description it makes it sound like they are printed on a type of paper that will have that vintage feel to them but instead they came printed on glossy photo paper... kinda ruins the whole vintage/old look I was going for. Very misleading when they call it “Archive paper”.

Several sets arrived with the pieces separated & required me to assemble them & tighten sections with needle nose pliers!? They are extremely lightweight as advertised which actually is nice.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: WARNING: Do NOT buy these, you will not use them!! I bought these as a gift for a friend who showed me some &#34;Druzy&#34; ear rings she liked. What I received in this order is NOTHING like the ones my friend showed me, but about the same price. I didn't expect much for the price, but I can not say enough about what garbage these things are, especially compared to the ones I was trying to match. The pictures will say enough.<br /><br />First, where are the backings?!<br /><br />Second, the bezels are not &#34;rose gold&#34;, as far as I can tell, not even a &#34;rose gold&#34; plate. Maybe some kind of paint or stain?<br /><br />One of the center pieces has a chip out of it and one of them has the center piece set so far off center, you can see it from several feet away which is made even more obvious because the centers are too small for the bezels. (Same as the other pair I bought.) There's also corrosion of some kind on one of the center pieces.<br /><br />Finally, there's no way I would want my friend to actually put these things through her skin. The posts are NASTY. They've already got some kind of corrosion on them and they're not smooth. (Also like the other pair I bought.)<br /><br />I don't know if these are really &#34;handmade&#34; or not, but they look like something bought for 10 cents each in a bag of 1000 from China.<br /><br />(I bought a second pair in another color and it suffered every one of the same problems plus some.) Now I have to waste my time sending them back.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Smaller than expected This was OK but smaller than a regular sheet of paper.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Do not stick! I needed these for an important project and was excited when they arrived (one day late) - but they don't stick!  They are all dried out.  Because I don't have time to return them as I need this project to get done, I had to use what I could by taping the dots on.  This is ugly and wasn't why I bought these!

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The price isn't worth the quality of the product. I was disappointed with the shirt. I ordered a purple shirt. When I got it, they had used black letters on a dark shirt. The letters actually looked like iron on letters. I don't understand why light letters aren't used on dark colored shirts. I had to buy fabric paint so that the words can be seen.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Nice hooks, but you have to buy your own screws The hook is the perfect size,  color and style that I wanted.  They seem sturdy. I went to hang it today and found out that the holes in the hook are too small for the black screws that were provided. I went to the hardware store and couldn't find any small enough in black. Now I'll need to find some black paint to put on the top of the screw after I install it. Makes my cost higher and a simple project take longer,  which is frustrating.  FYI - #4 × 3/4 is the size of wood screw that fit my hooks. I could have ordered a package of 100 from Amazon in the black that I needed but didn't want to spend that $11 for the amount of screws I needed.

I cannot return the band due to it being six days past the Amazon return window. I am so disappointed and also out $30, which is a large sum for a retiree.<br /><br />I love my new silver Fitbit bracelet. It is stylish and comfortable to wear. I like using the clasp much better than the buckle on the plain black band that came with my Fitbit.<br /><br />I did not find that attaching the bracelet to my Fitbit was overly complicated. Plus the seller sent extra pins in case of loss. Also, there were additional links to make the bracelet larger.<br /><br />I love my new bracelet, and I am glad I spent the bucks to buy it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: You may not get a lovely rose colored chrystal at all. The picture of the Rose Quartz ‘leather chain’ pendant was a lovely pink, and even though the product info indicated that the quartz you receive will not look exactly like the picture, I expected the ‘rose’ color to be beautifully apparent.  Instead, the pink on the quartz chrystal appeared white.  The leather chord from which the chrystal is suspended looks very cheap.  For some, the weight of the fairly large chrystal may be uncomfortable.  I would give the product ‘no stars,’ but the “submit” wouldn’t work if I didn’t.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: print is just perfect The print of dog paws with names is absolutely the best idea, so sweet. The tshirt quality is terrible, thin, and cheap.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Disappointing It does smell decent! But the package comes without any direction of how much to use or the ingredients inside. I did try it, using like I do my other bath salts and there was zero fizzing. It also had a hard time dissolving. It kind of sat there lumpy until I mushed it around. Turned the water a murky color. I thought it was lame so I added more water and bubble bath and I had no bubbles which usually work fine. It's like it sucked all the joy from my bath. I wouldn't buy this or give to a friend.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Don't Bother To Buy - This Is A Major Disapointment This product asked for 6 extra dollars to arrive a blue gift box, and instead it came in a trashy looking bland cardboard box. I have better and cuter gift boxes lying around my house I could've used, so that was a major let down.<br />And the chain came knotted and I couldn't unknot it! I tried gifting this to my mother but even she couldn't get it loose.<br />Also some of the engraved letters have a bit of a smudge.<br />Please, please, please save your money and look elsewhere.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Probably good for inactive people I'm giving this product two stars because in theory it was a great idea. However the reality of it is there's more bulk that's easier to catch on objects and the tape gets sweaty which is detrimental to keeping the omnipod on.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Spend more money elsewhere This is the most irritating purchase I think I’ve made, the pieces have no structure to them they’re super fragile, the finished image above is nowhere near what you are purchasing (seller needs to remove that image), half the prints don’t line up with the small rod assembly holes, they’re no instructions whatsoever, and you have to provide your own assembly rods, the butt stock is literally 2 different sizes, this seller needs to seriously address the quality of their products and redesign most of them, this isn’t the only item I’ve been severely disappointed with from them, you’re much better off going to an Etsy shop and spending a bit more money, it will be a much better investment.

Reason given…”Resized or altered jewelry cannot be returned.” I assume the symbol I selected to be embossed on underside of bracelet is considered an alteration. However, you have to choose a symbol or word to have embossed before you can place the order. Do not order if you think there is any reason you may want to return it!

The glitter is only on one side of the words.  The vinyl is very thin and floppy.  The wooden skewers that are glued to the vinyl of course get cake icing on them making you wonder if it is safe to use again.  This product arrived broken and the manufacturer felt she should not be blamed because that was the fault of the USPS.  I was very disappointed to have paid this much and then have to repair the item before it could be used only once.  I won't purchase from her again.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: If you are not patient, do not purchase! I hope the maker of these decals is working on an easier way to adhere them to a wall because I can't imagine they get many repeat customers. The designs are beautiful, but the process might have you second guessing your decision. The process takes days: 1. flatten decal for 24 hours 2. Apply decal to wall and let adhere for 24 hours 3. SLOWLY and CAREFULLY remove backing w/out ruining decal: at least 1 hour. It looks good, but it was rough-going several times. Review update: after all that effort, the decal is bubbling up and not sticking in some spots. I removed a star as a result. Buyer beware.

Within hours parts of it were soaked and the debris such as hay, straw pellets and poop would not entirely sweep up because they were sticking to the wet spots. Within a day I had to change the cage back to the paper bedding I was using because it stunk. The positive points are - it is a very cute print, is well sewn and thick. It was a generous size with some material left over.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute, but NOT sterling silver. So, I really love the styling of this ring.  And I was really excited to wear it, as the majority of the jewelry I wear on the daily is Sterling Silver. Real, 925 stamped, Sterling Silver.  This is not 925 sterling silver and should not be advertised as “sterling silver.”  It should be advertised as just a silver colored metal ring.  As you can see in the photo, the ring tarnished after wearing it one day. And, you can see that I am also wearing a Pandora bracelet, which I rarely take off.  I have never reacted to the Pandora bracelet or any other Sterling Silver jewelry that I wear daily.  The ring is very lightweight, which wasn’t a huge dealbreaker for me.  But false advertisement is a dealbreaker for me.  It’s really too bad, because it is a cute ring.  I’d have purchased more of these as gifts for friends. This was a first and last purchase for me.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not the same as the picture Great idea, wanted to like it, but it doesn't look as it does in person. The lips and mouth look huge, so it doesn't look right.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Masks are made upside down. For correct fit remove wire and wear design on left cheek Love to support small business. I am a sewer and a pattern maker. Although these are beautiful designs, I was disappointed when they arrived. The masks are sewn upside down. This is a common mistake with masks patterns. People don’t know the top from the bottom. The maker needs to switch the pattern around. If you fold the mask in half and touch the ear parts together you can see along the food which part is intended for the nose. The deeper curvature is intended to fit the nose (the biggest part of the face). While the flatter part is for the lips. The maker sewed the nose wire in the side intended for the lips not the nose. They may have designed the floral pattern on the right cheek but the fit is wrong. The correct fit for the sewing pattern they used is intended for the floral pattern to fit on the left cheek. It is unfortunate that the maker does not know how to correctly fit masks to the face. Hopefully the maker reads this and corrects the make of these beautiful masks.

Within about an hour of wearing it on my ankle it was very uncomfortable.  Because there's no velcro to adjust the looseness, it rubbed my ankle a lot.  As someone had said, you won't get any sleep measurements with this cover, so will have to remove it from its pouch (takes 10 minutes to get it in the pouch and about 5 minutes to get it out) each night and put the watch on a wrist band to measure sleep.  It does a great job at measuring steps, but the discomfort on my ankle isn't worth it.  Suggest getting a velcro closure instead.  It is very pretty, though.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Cheap chain Chain very thin and broke easily without much stress. Broke at links too not at clasp so I wasn't able to repair. Had to return.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Definitely not for a beginner Okay but hard for the beginner.  The video online is subpar because she only shows a limited amount of the steps and personally when I got my kit the outline of it was so light that it was so hard to follow that I ended up putting it away for over a month now, it’s not easy it’s not a beginner course and if you make a mistake and try and pull the felt back out you lose the line that are drawn supposedly into the mat and you don’t know what you’re supposed to do anymore. this was a large amount of money to put away for this kid and I’m just not happy with it.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: For small place needs matt in frame These pictures are okay they are small so you will need a mat inside a frame to make them of any size they're good in a small area like a bathroom or an entrance way other than that to use as any kind of Decor they're pretty useless. I thought they would be of a higher quality rather than just a print out on glass paper. I still haven't found a place to hang them yet but I haven't returned them because I do like the pictures themselves. Hope this helps

I was going to return them by the seller required that I pay shipping to return them. I already paid the shipping to get them. Very disappointed, what a waste of money.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Poor quality, construction Both shelves have terrible groves in them created when the wood was cut or sanded - and with the staining, were very noticeable. Then after measuring (instructions do not have measurements), the shelves do not stay on - they hang and are terribly flimsy. There's nothing to secure them. As I pulled one off, a metal bracket broke. Plus, both pieces are not the same size and since I'm stacking them, it's noticeable.<br /><br />I had to buy brackets to secure to the shelf and wall, and that's the only way I was able to firmly secure this on the wall. That means I only used the wood which is something I could have done from the start.

I complained to the company that the size of the single letter was smaller than my tags with 3 letters. There response was...that's the largest size letter we have available and adding my paraphrasing...sorry you don't like it, but you're stuck with it since we don't accept returns regardless of whether you're satisfied or not.

After a week of wearing it, the part of the bracelet that tightens and loosens it doesn't keep the bracelet snug.  It comes undone and I now I have to constantly keep tightening the bracelet because it keeps falling off. The roping pattern that's used isn't working out too well. I wouldn't get this again.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Again, not pleased (sad face) I was hoping that this would feel authentic. I am very disappointed with the quality. I feel like this necklace is a toy, and will probably send it to my 7 year old grand daughter. I don't even know if the resin actually contains real gem stones. I would not recommend this necklace to anyone. Yes, it would make a good gift to a kid, but not an adult.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: DONT BUY THESE!!! These earrings were delivered on Tuesday. And today, Saturday they are totally ruined on the back of each earring.  It is as if the black color rubbed off. I am really disappointed and think this is a real ripoff.  Amazon should not sell these

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very cheap, not worth price, will probably only last one use. I had very high hopes that the cost would match the produce, these are very very cheap. Flat metal glued onto wood dipped in green paint with clear coat. The pick makes them look so much more worth it. I do not recommend at all unless maybe for one time use. Very disappointed considering the price. Should only cost 2$ ....
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I really wanted to love these earrings! I was really looking forward to these earrings. I had been trying to mind something minimalist, so when I saw them I though, PERFECT! When they arrived I realized they only come with one pair not two. (Which was my own fault for not reading more carefully and assuming based on the picture used.)<br />When they arrived I realized they are not nearly as cute as in the picture. The earring back itself is very cheap and it pinches and rolls easily when putting them on, and doesn’t want to come off.<br />The earrings themselves don’t match. One is smooth and shiny like the picture. The other looks like a hammered nail head. It’s even bent.<br />I wouldn’t recommend these earrings.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Misleading Photos. The product is only the little cloth face mask, not the larger mask shown in each and every photo. Admittedly, I should have figured this out based on the low price, but still, it's misleading at best and deceptive at worst. I do appreciate how easy it was to cancel this order.

I ended up having to purchase a frame to put it in which is fine but not what I intended on.  If they didn’t advertise this a sign I would've read more about it. Since I was looking for an actual sign (typically made of metal or sometimes plastic) I probably would not have bought it

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Painful Infection I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Too short😤 The quality was very good - thick & the fact that it could be personalize, is a bonus. I ordered 2 for my brother & his wife. Unfortunately, it was very short. It would not even fit my neck and I have an almost thin neck. So, what's the use of a good craftsmanship if you can't wear it? Too bad, I could have bought more as a 🎁 since many were asking me where I got my leather lanyard (from another company).

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Tiny, puny, overpriced...bad decision! Avoid unless you like small stuff! The amulet was way smaller than I expected. I probably should have looked deeper into the product description but I thought for the price, it would have to be a reasonable size....I was wrong and it was puny! I started the return process and was told by the company that it was going to cost about $10 to return and after everything was all boxed up , I was charged $27 to return it! I was disgusted and frankly, rather angry. I’ve never been so disappointed by a product that I bought from amazon...especially something that I purchased as a relic of my personal beliefs. If I could give less than one star, I would.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Great idea but the letters peel after 2 weeks. Love the idea. But the lettering doesn’t last. I received my case on Jan 4th. And it looks great. Loved it. Got so many compliments. But as of today, Jan. 15th, my name (Lisa gM) is not legible. Not happy. I use my watch edgy day so I’m not holding my phone often. I’m thinking if the lettering would sit on the inside of the case instead of the outside . It may have lasted a bit longer. I’m searching for another personalized case.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not the same formula I first tried Mojo products on a trip to Chicago with my sisters in January 2020. (Before things fell apart with pandemic) With my last batch and I literally told everyone I know it was the best eye cream ever. This new one I bought (off Amazon for ease) is not the same as my old one I just used up. The container is smaller, the formula has a more yellow tint, it is “harder” in the container and does not go on as smooth. So disappointed as I feel like I need to find a different eye cream now. I won’t be buying more from Mojo.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: It came pretty fast however quality is better than a speedy delivery!!!!!! I followed the directions all the way however the decal isn't sticking at all I had to put tape on the back of it. The unicorn especially was in need of tape to make it stay. I would have returned and still may, but my daughter loves it nonetheless. I wouldn't buy this product ever again especially since I spent the highest amount because I needed for it to be really big over her bed. I am totally dissatisfied with this product. I received a different name decal from another company and it was great no problems at all.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Poor quality This print was received as a wedding gift and while the thought was nice, the quality of the print could be better. The print is really dark and has no contrast and for $30 and personalized, I would expect better quality.<br /><br />Be sure you don't misspell either...one simple transpose of a letter and the company will not work with you. No return calls made, they expect you to purchase a new one and may offer 25% refund if you fight.<br /><br />Another disappointing factor is this print isn't available on their website, on here on Amazon. We aren't going to ask the person who gifted to buy a new one, nor do we feel the need to give them more money.<br /><br />If the print quality was better as well as CS, we would would have.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I went for a more expensive one and that was a mistake I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not my favorite It might just be me, but I really didn’t enjoy this. It feels very cheap and doesn’t do much to help with my picking issues.

I just got this shirt not even 24 hours ago… I’m not going through the hassle of arguing over returning the shirt and getting another one made so I’ll just be getting the shirt made somewhere else. So frustrated considering I paid a total of $26.26. AND it arrived late.<br /><br />On the bright side, they put it in a cute watermelon package 😂

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Smelly but not in a good way Has an odd smell reminiscent of burnt snuff (old fashioned ground powdered tobacco) 🫤
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful but secure the stone Love the look of this ring. It LOOKS like it has some weight to it. It doesn’t. Very lightweight which is okay. Main problem was the aquamarine stone. Apparently was glued into place and not with anything strong? I guess what would’ve helped is if they had extended the casing up and over the edges of the stone to secure it in place. Was so sad when it fell off a few hours after I started wearing it and o couldn’t find the stone. If I’d found it I would’ve used something to reattach since I love the look of this ring so much. Unfortunately couldn’t  find the stone and can’t afford to blow off $126 so I had to return. 🥲
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: it is a beautiful piece of jewelry I bought my Silver Metal Band in June 30, 2017. I was so excited when I reveived it. I got so much complements on it, it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. After wearing it for just a few months the charm discolored, that was a big disappointment. I changed the band. When I went back to use the Silver Metal Band the latch didn't snap back on. Its no good. I couldn't believe it. I probably use it for about 5 months, once I removed it that was it. I haven't been able to use it :/

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Hard to read “Bride” poor placement. Robe itself is nice. The writing on the back is VERY hard to read. It is NOT as legible as the sellers photos show (I will post my photo soon) I opted for an exact writing and coloring of robe and letters as seller has posted in her images. I had it made as a gift for my sister in law. I contacted the seller about this. I spent close to $45 including shipping (mind you seller and I are in the same state) and seller wrote back she would refund me IF I purchased another robe and she would try and place the writing in a more blank spot, due to the cut of the floral fabric. In less than 24hrs she closed the Amazon case before I was able to situate this issue. It should be stated that writing and floral cut is not guaranteed to be the same. It makes a big difference when the wording is directly through the flowers and in the same color as the flowers...

Be more impractical as they are not even solidly attached to each other to make one cohesive piece (They have made '8 inch' out of a 6 inch and 2 inch which are somehow not solidly attached but physically come apart).  The stain is orangey and I don't think the wood is reclaimed or industrial in feel, though it is real.  I hate the edge.  I hate it all.

This seller should really package the item better to prevent creasing from happening.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Bulky. Block of plastic with no refinement. This is a wildly popular holster. I bought it since it was on sale and I had other products from them. This time, I am disappointed. The product is very bulky making on belt carry feel/look silly. It lacks any refinement on the edges and is just a massive rectangle. The clip juts out so the bottom of the holster is flapping. Being a piece of plastic, it does not feel like it will last. I find myself bumping this holster into things at random, it is so bulky. I would return it but not worth the hassle.

It's been a few weeks since I received it in the mail and I haven't even been able to use it. The oil they used for the leather apparently doesn't dry...ever. I'm assuming they just used too much leather oil. I received it in the mail 15 days ago and it's still damp. I put a fan on it for 48 hours...still damp. I set it on a shelf in my garage where it's warm but not hot...still damp. I tried putting the case on my iPad but it leaves a thick film on the screen because the oil is so damp. I didn't leave the case on for more than 60 seconds. The case does look nice. If the case ever dries out, I will add another star to my review.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very flimsy I had high hopes for this product, I like the look of the design. I really wanted to like it. The problem is it’s made of an extremely lightweight material that causes it to tip over all the time. Taking glasses on and off it knock it off balance, lightly bumping against it causes it to tip. A simple solution would be a weighted base, which it doesn’t have. It is now broken since it tipped and crashed onto floor and broke apart. For the price, I would have been better buying a paper towel holder and sticky tape. Very disappointed, would not recommend buying. Gave it two stars instead one one since we did get a year worth of use out of ( even though it tipped all the time) before the final tipping broke it

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute but very small, hard to open/close I really liked this septum piercing and it looks lovely, but the circumference of the hoop is very small, so it's not very comfortable to wear. Also, you have to bend the hoop itself to "open" and "close" the jewelry, which makes it basically impossible to return it to the exact same shape and is also uncomfortable if the hoop gets twisted and the slightly open side gets in your nose.

The latest one is thin, flat down the front and flat down the rear though the sides are rounded. It bends easily and I’m afraid it will break.

I decided to purchase from Amazon as the seller is the actual company and not a reseller.<br /><br />Problem 1: They advertise this is using olive oil from their farm.<br /><br />Problem 2: They don’t use olive oil, as they use Sunflower oil which is a hormone disruptor and much cheaper than olive oil. They lied about being made with olive oil.<br /><br />Problem 3: The scent is nothing like the one I fell in love with years ago. This néw sunflower oil based one has no scent and dies down within in 5 mins.<br /><br />I’m extremely disappointed and was really forward to supporting this business, but they changed the formula to a cheaper and less quantity ingredients
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Description seems deceiving says “14k gold color plating” & very light weight Hoops appear nice, lightweight, comfortable, yet description seems misleading if 14k gold plating they’d weigh more; in fact these don’t seem metallic at all.<br /><br />Sry can’t recommend as good costume jewelry…

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Painful Infection I was super excited to get this jewelry in as it’s so cute and different. However, I got it in, put it in my ear and it was SO painful and caused me to get a keloid and infection within a day. I bought my bestfriend the exact same ear ring and she had the same problem. I’ve had my piercing for years so it isn’t that it was new. Basically a waste of $20 in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Do not waste your money. This thing is so small. Smaller the my finger for $8 what a joke. I’ll never buy anything for this place again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Full moon picture is signed....on the moon If you look closely, the full moon picture is signed on the moon itself. It looks completely out of place.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: don't waste your money This hoop is horrible. Its smaller than what I says it is. Would be good if it was a little bigger. Hugs my nose too much. When trying to adjust it, it feels it may break easy.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Buy a frame. I had no idea that I was purchasing invitation paper. Again, I thought that this was a product that I could use right away, so its been in the box since it arrived...

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Toooo much lilac I wanted this product since I love Yennifer. I love the Withcer. The lilac is soo overpowering and strong it made me nauseous.  I tried to wash it off, and it wouldn't come off! If you are a person that isn't into floral smells, don't buy!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: A little disappointed I received my canvas a few days ago and I was so excited when I seen it was close to arriving. But when I received the package was way smaller than the picture on Amazon makes it look. So I was disappointed that it was smaller than I expected and it cost me $120 for something that was a print out of a picture. I would’ve been OK with it if I paid $50 for it at max before $120 and how the Display picture makes it seem it’s very disappointing when it’s not anything like that.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Inaccurate Pictures. Boxy and Scratchy Material. Ordered this based on the picture. Definitely NOT as described. For one, the color pictured (heather grey) is not what I received. It is a very light grey. Also the material is HORRIBLE. I've felt sand paper softer than this shirt. It is not at all flattering either. It's just a big body shirt.<br /><br />I also reached out to the seller to return this item and they never responded.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Horrible reaction I absolutely LOVED this nose ring at first. It was thin and snug. Literally everything I’d been looking for. After about two weeks my nose became sore and red. I tried to take a pic of it but you can’t see the bump. It’s right inside my nose piercing. I removed the nose ring and white pus came out. If it was real it wouldn’t have caused a reaction. Hopefully mine was just a cheap fluke and the others wouldn’t be. Very sad because I loved this nose ring
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Assembly required 😮‍💨 Didn't see anywhere in the description of the to ring that we would have to do some bend/twisting on it before it can be worn.<br />The one I received could be done with just my fingers I had to use a jewelry tool on it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Beautiful but not functional This watch band is gorgeous, the stones are even more pretty than in the pictures.  But they band does not fit snug no matter how I try to arrange it and suck it down and that causes my watch to not lay flat on my wrist and it thinks I am not wearing it and requires password over and over again.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Hardly any scent, greasy-feeling, no value here I was really hoping for some of that bayberry fragrance from my childhood holidays, but it was not to be.  The fragrance when I opened that package was minimal - had to stick my nose right up near the wax - and when I put it in the melter, it disappeared altogether.  The cubes are even seriously greasy when handling.  The packaging was even hard to get open.  These are not worth the money spent, for sure.<br /><br />This may be the first single star review I've given an actual product (not a digital) on Amazon, but here it is.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: poor fitting size All excited about a leather shoe protector as my elastic ones stretch out and need replacing in less than a year.

I wear a man's shoe and normal Red Wing shoe, size 14 narrow.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Instructions unclear, very difficult to apply Really wanted to like this decal, unfortunately the included instructions were very unclear in their verbage. Watching the video they referenced did help somewhat.<br /><br />Biggest gripe: The decal is NOT cut to the 4Runner window; you have to do it yourself. Applied one side and it looked terrible, also did not stick well (doubt it would survive an automatic carwash). My recommendation, go to a local shop that specializes in auto decals/wraps and have them do it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Really expensive.  Really small.  Doesn't work. This thing is smaller than you think.  About half the size of a shot glass.  That isn't the problem though, the problem is that the matches don't work.  I broke about 10 of them before giving up.  And each time you strike one, it leaves a large black streak on the side.  I also read reviews saying that only the matches that it comes with will work... you can't just by any strike-anywhere match.  Well, I'm sorry to say but the matches that it comes with don't work either!  If this thing was a little bigger, it might be worth it just to keep as a decorative jar on your shelf.  But it is way too small for that.  And being that the matches don't work either, this thing is worthless.

So, you have to trust what you receive will be nice. I purchased one box for myself and one as a gift. Out of 12 total bath bombs approximately 5 smell acceptable. I recommend the vendor allow the purchaser to choose scents. This will allow the vendor to track what is working/popular and what should be ccx eliminated from the product line. I did appreciate the fact each bath bomb is individually sealed. Nice touch.

Was so excited to find some pumpkin scents &#34;our of season!&#34;<br /><br />Nope, scent, fully melted can't be enjoyed it's so weak in the room with the burner. Sigh.....burnt one from one of three packs, two days ago and even hubby and his sensitive nose couldn't detect it unless quite close to the burner, so skipped a day and just wiped another out of the burner, this time the Pumpkin cupcake.<br /><br />Is it the soy that somehow makes these things weaker than non-soy?? because I bought soy squares from two different companies in this one order and it's weak, too!!<br /><br />Help me and yes, some of you I hope will still try this label and give them a chance, just in case......I right now have another, known and reliable brand in my burner, so when it's totally melted awhile I am going to walk into the garage and back into the house to see if it's *my nose* or for sure, this product.<br /><br />I am honest and sincere. I do not own wax company or know anyone that does. I'm hooked on the stuff. Heck yeah, there's something cool about aromatherapy but I am surprised to even be able to say this.<br /><br />To the owners, are you maybe not using enough oil? Not buying a strong enough oil product? Then if not, help me understand, how is it that Walmart's &#34;ScentSationals&#34; brand is, not all scents for any one nose, but a lot of theirs are strong! so strong that I can smell it out of the room it burns in and across a large livingroom, the other side of it?<br />Yesterday, I took a break from these two new brands and burnt &#34;Warm Apple Pie&#34; by walmart and dang!! it was barely melted and we both were smelling it 20 feet and more, from the burner, then as expected it filled the two rooms, honestly and it is not soy.<br /><br />So, is it possibly that we are not meant to be fans of *any brand* of SOY? if so....folks reading this, please give this brand more chances,<br />God bless the owners cuz dang, am surprised and not happy about this.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: I went for a more expensive one and that was a mistake I really wanted to like it. But I'm pretty disappointed for that price. It came way out of shape. In the little booklet which came with it, it said to press it together to make it smaller but since it was so big that didn't work well without any tools. I got it to fit somehow but it looks cheap now since it does not have a nice round shape. It does look cheap on my arm too. I hope it does at least not make my skin green that would be horrible. I don't think the problem would have been fixed by going with a smaller size. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and wanted it to sit loose. Before I squeezed it together the opening was so big I was only able to balance it on my arm for the picture if I would have turned my arm it would have fallen off immediately.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Faceted, no shine I returned these earrings because it didn’t meet my expectations. I was looking for earrings to compliment a sterling silver moonstone ring I purchased for a song at an antique mall. The stones in the earrings are faceted and had NO high lustrous shine, like the ring, plus it was so much more in price than the ring I cherish.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute but the metal was not for me The video was really helpful to put in, but it irritated my skin and started turning green within a few weeks of wear. This could have been my fault because I have long nails and used some tweezers to help adjust it which did scratch the metal a bit. Overall super cute and I liked how it looked but may not be great for long term wear. I've had my nose pierced for about 10 years and it usually is tolerant to any jewelry I use for it.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Bent out of shape! These are lovely wire earrings. However, the wire is very thin and delicate. It was extremely difficult to put the clear earring backs that came with them on. The amount of force it took to get the backs onto the wire and then up to the point behind the ear bent the wire completely out of shape. I was so disappointed because they are beautiful earrings. It seems like they are the wrong size. The hole was too small to easily glide onto the wire. Since the back part of the wire is visible and an integral part of the overall design, there isn't a way to regain the delicate curve. I really liked these earrings, but sadly the wire just doesn't hold up.

I got this because Amazon can't figure out which house is which despite all our mail boxes are numbered!  The bracket is plastic and a little on the flimsy side, the pole is 1/16" thick (light gauge) metal tubing that might be powder coated, not sure. The sign is a respectable gauge metal though it is using applied (stickers) reflective numbers. The lamp is a cheap plastic thing that might survive 6 months outside. All in all while it looks decent (in the pictures), it's not worth the $100 + I paid for it, $50 - $60 is a more appropriate price. Feeling a little ripped off!<br /><br />3 months later.....<br />The sign has now fallen off, due to the sign rocking in the wind the holes have worn through and I found the sign laying on the ground. The holes in the sign need to be re-enforced somehow to prevent wear, not sure how but it's going to be easier just to buy something else rather than fix. Has turned out to be a waste of money. Oh, BTW, the lamp is no longer working, not that it worked that well to begin with!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Note that it must be washed in cold and hung to dry I was excited to get a cover for my bolster, but unfortunately I never got to use it because the cotton was not pre-shrunk and I didn’t notice at the bottom of the long description with all of the size options that it says it must be washed below 30° C (which I had to look up when the shop owner pointed it out to me, it’s 86° F). So I threw it in the wash with the rest of my sheets and when it came out it did not fit. No dryer even.<br /><br />But I am not going to order a replacement because I don’t want a pillowcase that I have to wash separately from all of my other linens. And I don’t have a dryer now, but when I do I won’t want to have to hang dry one dumb pillowcase. That’s way too high maintenance for a pillowcase! And while technically she did warn me in the description, if an item does require special treatment then it should have a tag with clear instructions rather than requiring people to read long descriptions that mostly are just size options, understand international conversions, and then remember said special instructions.<br /><br />It is well sewn though. She just should have used pre-shrunk cotton instead of passing all of this hassle on to the customer.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute but does not work well I bought this to replace an older tortilla warmer that I accidentally burnt, figured it had to be very similar in construction from the looks of it and with such a cute graphic! But no… it is poorly designed, there is only thin cloth layers instead of the efficient construction of other brands that include thicker, puffy cloths layered with a film to protect the tortilla from drying out and preventing a fast temperature drop after heating, and also the size  does not allow for many tortillas… ended up replacing it right away with a larger, much better constructed warmer that I am including in the picture for comparison. If you ABSOLUTELY GOTTA HAVE THE GRAPHIC, then consider that you will need to layer up, or your tortillas will be hot only coming out the microwave and then get dry and cold before you even finish rolling up your taco.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: It is cute, but thin!  Teachers, look elsewhere! I was disappointed with the quality. I thought it would be heavier duty for the price. I was also surprised  and disappointed with how small the side pockets were. I thought I would put a metal water bottle in the side, but it is too small.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: First Thoughts before install Liked the deep rich color of the grips without any cloudy or milky spots from the sealant. The Navy medallion is nice touch and large for the grip. The set of grips I received the medallion sticks up way too much on the edges and would mess up my touch while gripping my firearm. The medallion should be recessed further into the grip so that it is flush with the checkering of the grip on the edges. If that is possible because of the size of the medallion.  However, again because of the size it should also have a slight curve. The original Colt gold medallions have a screw/nut to retain them in the grip. These do not. My grip set had clear cement smeared all around the medallion and into the checkering. Was able to clean up with old toothbrush and so not to sure about durability. I spent the 10.99 for 2day shipping however must return for refund or exchange : if, recessing the medallion to remain flush on the outer edges is possible. Mine sticks up above the wood. I might give this another try. Will update-<br />Well, I was told to return as they could not recess the Navy medallion any deeper into the grip to make it flush.<br />However, The medallion popped right off of the grip and with a boring bit you can fix their mistake and lack of support for shoddy workmanship. These would NEVER hold up with everyday use sticking up like they were. So I revise my review to 1 star...

However, on the second day of wearing it, the chain got tangled in my baby hairs again on the back of my neck and broke. I never pulled on it hard or anything like that though because I knew it was fragile.<br />And also, when I first received the package, there was a knot in the chain because they hadn’t coiled it around anything and left it free flowing to tangle itself.<br />So overall, I love the heart charm with my engraved letter on it, but the chain is too fragile.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Worth the money to try, not a good buy for me personally Super irritating and my ears aren’t typically sensitive.  Could’ve just been my own bad experience.  Worth trying out for the money to see for yourself!
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Not same color as pictured. The color is not the same as in the photo. Returned for refund
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cute, but photo is misleading The felt balls are a nice color and good quality. However, the photo was very misleading. If had realized I would have needed to count the number in the photo to compared to how many actually come on the strand, I wouldn’t have bought it.  It only reaches 7’ because the thin string they are on is that long. Instead, with the number of balls on it, as opposed to the photo, they have to be spaced so far apart to reach the advertised length, and it’s just not as cute as the photo makes them out to be.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Waste of money! Such a wast of money. This is the smallest flimsiest metal that you can tell they just snipped from a spool of long wire and made circular. Don’t wast your money.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Nothing special I ordered these for a friend whos mother passed away 10 yrs ago named Penny.  These I thought would be perfect, but when they arrived they are literally pennies with a hole and a hook.  They didn't seem like anything super special.  I did send them back and the seller was very quick to return funds.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: BUYER BEWARE!!!

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Bad paint. Bought a pair for my girlfriend for Christmas. Seemed nice at first but after wearing them for a few hours I noticed that the paint on the earrings was rubbing off onto her skin and that the paint would smear if we touched it. Disappointed.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Unfortunately unbearable to wear. I hate to do this but after looking at these shoes for 2 years I finally decided to buy them as a birthday present to myself.<br /><br />I love the way they look and the quality of the leather but after trying to wear them multiple times I've decided that they are unbearable.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Completely disappointed Kept the pits perfumed and odorized for a max two hours before fading; and this occurred 24/7. Not to mention the something-wood scent was not even strong and satisfying. Have a second thought before spending your money on the wood-scented one, maybe the lavender would be different.

They are ok for the price I guess but, I wouldn't buy them again.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Took forever to arrive and is made so cheaply! Do not fall for this scheme First of all the name is a STICKER! It took forever to be delivered. The lid cracked after the first hand wash. Then when trying to use it a second time I pulled off the lid and half of the lid came off and half of it was still stuck in the cup.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Disorganized, bulky, difficult to use After reading all the positive reviews, I had high expectations.  I've used the wallet for 2 weeks now and I am very disappointed.  Whenever I pull the wallet out to pay, everything is in disarray.  The credit cards turn sideways, even the bills slip around.  All the credit cards touch each other, creating wear, and it is difficult to pull just one card out.  I finally decided that this wallet is not for me, only to find out that returns are not easy.  You get stuck with both shipping charges and they tell you that the product has to be in new condition.  This is ironic because when the product first arrives, Mr. Lentz tells you give it some time and "wear it in" before deciding if you like it or not.  All around not a good experience.  I do not recommend this wallet.

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Paint or glue? Very beautiful ring. Edge is a bit sharp and I suspect you want a loose fit otherwise it would dig in your skin. My big disappointment came when I noticed what appeared to be silver paint or glue on the gem along the setting (see pictures). I tried lightly scraping it off with little result. Normally, such a blemish would cause the ring to get rejected for sale. I would have rated this ring with 5 stars but with such a blemish, 2 stars is appropriate.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Not worth the money The setting on the ring was messy. It looks like they just melted the metal around the rock and took no time to clean it up to look “dainty” as advertised. For the amount I paid, I expected better.

Not at all what I was expecting.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Very cute but not real gold, not for those with allergies this hoop is so cute but unfortunately not real gold. i received this hoop as a gift almost a year ago and noticed irritation the day after putting it in. I looked at the packaging and it looked like it was from a cute small business that makes jewelry and trusted it was real gold. i assumed my irritation was just due to switching from a stud. nearly 8 months later my nose has been on and off infected despite me taking care of it. luckily, when I took the hoop out to clean it the metal bended and wouldn’t look like a hoop anymore. I went into the jewelers for a new hoop and was told that this one was not real gold. i have a new hoop in that I paid $100 for and my nose immediately feels better after a day. im super sensitive so this hoop and the false advertisement really put me through hell. but if you’re not allergic to certain jewelry this is truly the cutest and most simple gold hoop at there. so sad to give it up but my nose has been rejecting it

Because I was going to wrap the gift myself I ordered a plain bag not realizing it would be sent without a photo of the puzzle inside. How did this company expect a toddler to put it together without a photo. This is a very low class company and does not stand behind their products. I was told I would not get my money back.  In other words I had to pay extra to see what I ordered when it arrived.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Meh Im really disappointed. It took almost a month to arrive and they never responded to my message when I reached out. The bow doesn’t come tied but that wasn’t really a big deal for me, what was though is that for the money I paid, I got waiting almost a month for fake lambs ear to arrive in the mail and it’s not in great condition. Its pretty, but some of the leaves have the texture sort of cleared off? Overall it smells really nice but it does fade very fast, as is expected. I don’t think this purchase was worth it.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: The clasp broke immediately. I bought this for my wife while I was away for some time. When she opened it and tried to put it on for the first time, the clasp broke. I subtracted 3 stars for cheap chain and clasp. She absolutely loved the sunflower trinket though. I just have to fix it for her to actually wear it and enjoy it.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Save your money Very upset about this purchase. I was so excited to get it and give it to my husband for our 3rd anniversary (the 3rd one is leather) that I gave it to his early. He ran his finger across the lettering to feel the engraving and the black smeared really bad. This was supposed to be a special surprise that’s getting returned. 🥺
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: I did not like this pendant, but I kept it. I was very disappointed in the pendant. Very small, and misleading. I have been to Israel recently, and I purchased the Roman Glass earrings, so I purchased this necklace to match, it was no what I had expected. So, I went on Esty, and I ordered one from there, and that was absolutely beautiful. This one is a waste of money!

True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Not real garnet I personally contacted the seller to verify if it was real garnet or not and not only did the message come across as snarky,, (exact words: "it says in the description doesn't it?") But I took this item to a gemologist and she verified it was not garnet at all. My main purpose for the purchase was to access the properties of garnet. If you just want a pretty bracelet this is for you. If you are looking for a genuine garnet bracelet for its metaphysical properties search elsewhere.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Get what you pay for You get what you pay for. The other reviews are so positive I was excited to buy this for my wife for Valentine’s Day. When I got it I had to scratch the “engraving” because it appeared more like a sticker than an engraving. The chain is not the best quality, but like I said, for a low price the custom option is great and delivery is quick.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Turns out, its got nickel... I had an allergic reaction to this. As far as I know, im only allergic to nickel, and it looks like there is nicely under the silver on the parts if the ring where my nose reacted. So im pretty sure this is silver plated nickel... it is, as another reviewer put, not hypoallergenic.<br />Im very disappointed that this was falsely advertised as nicely free, but then came with nickel in it.<br /><br />Additionally, the photo shows a thicker product than what you receive.

True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Lost in 1 day These are pretty. The size is not too big or too small. But don’t believe what the description says about them not falling out. I lost an earring in less than a day of wearing these, and that’s after having one fall out (and noticing it) THREE times. Finally I realized I was wearing only one and the other was nowhere to be found.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Nickel, cheap. Do not trust it especially with sensitive ears I cannot wear fake jewelry….I usually wear real gold earrings, but wanted to try some hoops. These inflamed my ears like crazy. Now they are inflamed, irritated, and had to pull these out and returning. Do not buy these if you have sensitivities.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Feels scammy They were difficult to set up and didn’t work properly once they were connected.  A big red flag for me was realizing that you are slammed with sponsored “positive (fake)” reviews on YouTube and the negative reviews were being suppressed.  Believe the negative reviews whether you read them here or on other platforms.  They don’t work properly for the price you pay.  Look elsewhere to stay connected to your loved ones.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Trying to return for almost 2 months The product is cute, just as pictured. However need to return due to changes in outlet and seller hasn't gotten back to me in nearly 2 months. HELP!
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Definitely not hypoallergenic or for sensitive ears. They are perfect for my daughter's Miraculous Ladybug costume, but they caused her to have a really bad allergic reaction on her earlobes.

True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheap. It was a decent amount of money for a fairly cheaply made box. I likedthe writing style. Do your homework and look around a little bit. I'm going to jazz it up with stain,  some additional hardware and a velvet lining inside.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: . Was disappointed, I could’ve copied and printed my own pictures. Overpriced!
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Was excited until it came broke These are really beautiful. I just wish the gems were set better as mine came with one gem fallen out. I will repair with super glue but it makes me nervous about how long the other gems will last. Earrings move a lot or get caught in hair so I like my earrings to be sturdy. Hopeful that this was just a fluke. But take caution when purchasing
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Color different from picture Color was different from what was described.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: Color not as advertised. The earrings that arrived are darker and more jade-green tinted than the photo. One earring had many black lines and the other had one black line so they don’t match perfectly. Cheap looking, even at $15. One good things is the backs secure well.
True: 0, Predicted: 0, Text: Cheaply made.. it broke w/in 3 days of wearing!! It was very cute but only lasted about 3 days before the entire top popped off completely fron the bottom portion of the nose ring. So, if I were u, I wouldn't waste my money.
True: 1, Predicted: 1, Text: 50¢ machine Quality Absolutely disappointed. Already returning after having just got it, from the description pictures you'd think it would be of really nice quality. But when it arrived I realized they charged me a ridiculous price for something that is of 50¢ machine quality.
True: 2, Predicted: 2, Text: Tarnished I had the beaded nose ring for a couple months, daily wear. The two smaller beads are black-everything else is still goldtone. The tarnished part looks awful, throws off the original aesthetic of the gold ring.<br />Thankfully didn't spend too much, but would have preferred to spend money on a quality item.

It's absolutely not giftable.

This for me, just graduating college was a lot to spend. I was so excited when I received them. They were beautiful. But,  as I’ve worn mine daily since 7/29/22, the metal around the gems is red. Your website claimed the item to be sterling silver (925). I’m so disappointed and embarrassed since I gave the other two as gifts and they are in the same shape as mine. What a shamble.
